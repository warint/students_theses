 seong-tae lee: recent development korean bond market dinner speech mr seong-tae lee, deputy governor bank korea, korea university/ bi conference asian bond market research, seoul, 22 march 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, i please speak today asian bond market research conference, co-hosted korea university bis. a well aware, past half century asian region achieve unprecedentedly high economic growth, emerge among key player world economy. with continue remarkable economic growth, trade within asian region grow rapidly, also greatly increase demand financial funds. however, regional financial market far develop sufficiently meet demand. asia’s bond markets, particular, far le develop state develop countries. accord imf statistics, amount outstanding primary bond market asia’s nine emerge market economy combine total 1 trillion 473 billion dollar end 2002. this 8% size u.s. primary bond market, 12% 15 eu country combine 21% japan. the ratio asia’s outstanding stock bond gdp mere 43%, far low figure 182% u.s., 146% eu 175% japan. in secondary bond market well, almost regional economy much small ratio turnover average outstanding stock compare advance nations. there argument 1997 financial crisis aggravate poorly develop regional bond markets. the argument go financial structure asian economy overly reliant bank bond market poorly developed, asian country rely investment short-term foreign borrowings, inevitably draw hurry regional crisis hit. recently, asian country accumulate significant amount foreign assets, thank continue current account surpluses. however, due underdevelop bond market here, say inefficiency raise manage foreign fund region. in wake financial crisis, therefore, country region come realize necessity develop bond market relate infrastructure. this enlightenment become momentum drive country region make necessary efforts. let share effort korea make since financial crisis order develop bond markets, tell achieve far. before financial crisis, korea issue large quantity government bonds, due observe balance budget principle. once crisis break out, however, long-cherished principle maintain balance budget abandoned, government begin actively issue bonds, mean finance soar fiscal deficit support economic recovery. with technical support imf world bank, korea also embarked, step-by-step manner, series institutional improvements. these include introduction regular government bond auctions, establishment primary dealer system, integration different type government bonds, open korea government bond future market introduction fungible issue system. for part, bank korea also make considerable effort help develop country’s bond markets, include government bond market. before crisis, korean government bond issuance extent carry accordance market mechanism. a portion bond issuance discretionarily allocate underwrite certain financial institutions. the remain part bond take bank korea, nation’s central bank. the government also sometimes finance fiscal need rely borrow bok rather issue bonds. since june 1998, however, bok accept government request underwrite government bond advise government issue government bond market, base market interest rates. in addition, bi review 18/2004 1 bok improve infrastructure relate bond transactions. it introduce electronic competitive bid process government bond use bok-wire adopt delivery-versus-payment system government bonds. a result efforts, outstanding volume korean government bond grow almost seven time since 1997, turnover ratio bond skyrocket 23 time period. in 2003 issuance five-year government bond increase substantially thank government’s effort meet grow demand longer-term bond part institutional investor pension fund insurance companies. the five-year korea government bond future market also set order allow hedge associate risks. in line developments, proportion five-year government bond total bond issuance increase 7 percentage point 2003, 36%. korea’s corporate bond market also process become advanced, introduction new financial instrument establishment relevant institution support bond market development. since 1999, new product abs (asset-backed securities), mb (mortgage-backed securities), abcp (asset-backed cp), clos (collateralized loan obligations) cbos (collateralized bond obligations) introduced. after financial crisis, market structure corporate bond shift focus secure bond rather unsecured bonds, change require scientific analysis issuers’ credit risk. in response need, set new credit rat agency allowed, fierce competition among credit rat agency lead significant development credit risk analysis techniques. there also many improvement term market behavior. with implementation mark-to-market bond valuation, rate return fund management evaluate disclose accordance daily bond yields. the introduction system interest rate risk management also make institutional investor respond sensitively change bond rates. accordingly, become common practice market participant closely watch bok’s monetary policy, along economic development home abroad. a i describe it, korea’s bond market go remarkable changes, term quality quantity, since financial crisis. the government bond market, particular, totally reshape across primary secondary markets, well infrastructure. we believe korea’s bond market develop future make continuous effort heighten bond market efficiency push corporate restructuring. there considerable discussion go recently, various international cooperative forum asean+3 emeap (executives’ meet east asia pacific central banks), development regional bond markets. in asean+3, particular, view securitization credit guarantee discussed. in relation issue, korea put together two-tier securitization draft proposal make securitization credit guarantee mechanism. other nation also develop plausible draft proposal fields. meanwhile, emeap, comprise 11 central bank monetary authority east asia pacific region, raise one-billion dollar fund invest dollar-denominated bond issue country region. take arrangement one step further, emeap actively discuss way expand fund invest local currency-denominated bond region. under circumstances, i think conference significant, bring together distinguish scholar expert home abroad, diagnose reason asia's bond market develop sufficiently propose new vision idea way facilitate them. i hope many active discussion tomorrow today, variety epoch-making view advance concern development regional bond markets. thank attention, i hope enjoy dinner. 2 bi review 18/2004 john hurley: euro area monetary policy eu enlargement speech mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, aci ireland, dublin, 22 march 2004. * * * first, let say please i opportunity share think evening. i would like begin say little euro area monetary policy framework, review clarify last year, go outline monetary policy euro area conduct first five year emu. i turn attention current monetary policy environment recent exchange rate developments, look broad structural fiscal policy issue and, finally, speak briefly imminent enlargement eu. the euro area monetary policy framework turn euro area monetary policy, five year euro area single currency single monetary policy conduct govern council ecb. the introduction single currency historical landmark. in twelve countries, euro replace national currency rapidly become part everyday life. for business community, intra-euro area exchange rate volatility uncertainty cause trade investment eliminated. in financial area, role euro global market growth use new currency outside euro area past five year also impressive. the euro quickly become important part global financial system evidence past five year role continue grow time yet. within euro area, key challenge formulate implement single monetary policy. since “one size fit all” policy, many doubt initially express whether possible formulate common monetary policy diverse area. i think experience date policy successful. in practice, govern council formulate policy much way many central banks, is, focus control inflation. there significant benefit derive keep inflation low: support consumer purchase power; avoid misallocation resource associate inflation deflation; serf reduce uncertainty risk premia financial markets, ultimately facilitate low medium long-term interest rates, important anchor wage development enhancement competitiveness economy. in short, maintain price stability key contribution monetary policy make achieve sustainable growth job creation. be clear mandate, fulfil it, help central bank foster credibility. to ensure monetary policy firmly anchor inflation expectation start govern council adopt monetary policy strategy forward-looking, focus medium-term broadly based. to successful maintain price stability also important rationale decision-making clearly understood. a i sure aware, area subject criticism past. reflect this, four year experience, monetary policy strategy review clarify 2003. two important point clarification emerge exercise, address misunderstand emerged. first, regard definition price stability, clarify objective maintain inflation, euro area whole, rate close 2 per cent medium-term. second, regard assessment risk price stability, review clarify way govern council integrate signal come economic analysis, one hand, monetary analysis, other. in particular, make clear monetary analysis mainly serf mean cross-checking, medium long-term perspective, short medium-term indication inflation come economic analysis. the conduct monetary policy since 1999 have outline govern council formulate implement euro area monetary policy, i would like make short assessment conduct policy past five years. in early years, single monetary policy conduct test environment, bi review 18/2004 1 characterise series shocks. at various time past five year period exceptional economic, financial geopolitical uncertainty. the first 18 month witness triple oil prices, peak dotcom boom significant fall value euro. the subsequent correction sizeable imbalance generate late 1990s boom, ally heighten geopolitical tensions, trigger critical sustain period economic financial uncertainty witness decades. this uncertainty persist last spring, unwind considerably since then, effect still linger. on top this, also see sharp appreciation euro, particularly dollar, take level high initial launch. from short outline, clear economic financial environment past five year provide stiff test single monetary policy. give background, outcome? over past five years, evidence indicate inflation inflation expectations, signal rate price increase anticipate future, remain firmly control. since begin 1999, indicator long-term inflation expectation euro area remain close 2 per cent. this suggest new single monetary policy successful anchor long-term inflation expectation public market convince determination maintain price stability medium-term. this significant achievement relatively short period time important factor permit euro area interest rate fall low level decades. it also recall that, establishment euro single monetary policy, significant difference long-term interest rate level across countries. a key achievement, also indication credibility european monetary union, convergence long-term interest rate low level prevail area average level. this help improve finance condition many part euro area. ally fact intra-euro area exchange rate volatility also thing past, create much favourable environment consumers, business community investors. recent development background in recent years, main influence monetary policy, euro area globally, heighten economic financial uncertainty persist mid-2003, after-effects still fully dissipated. against background, already exceptionally low global interest rate reduce further. in euro area, inflation inflation expectation control, govern council low interest rate two occasions, march june 2003, effectively bring rate level equivalent post-world war ii lows. for euro area, 2003 third successive year economic growth decelerated. for year whole, euro area economy grow 0.4 per cent, disappoint performance, consider economy already register potential growth 2001 2002. however, average figure mask fact that, several year par growth, gradual recovery activity underway since around middle last year. the main impetus euro area recovery come improvement global economic performance, which, turn, reflect number factors. initially, unwind geopolitical uncertainties, facilitate rebound confidence, especially business confidence, second-half last year. more fundamentally, however, recovery, particularly us, acquire considerable momentum sizeable policy stimulus put place recent years; indeed scale stimulus pose medium-term risk continuation recovery there. further contributory factor performance equity markets, rally considerably course last year, also unwind investment overhang create late 1990s boom, remove important headwind growth. the improvement global economic environment, however, simply reflect development us. growth also resume japan, accelerate uk east asia, where, instances, slowdown le pronounced. the current euro area monetary policy environment in case euro area, recovery clearly lag major economies. a case elsewhere, strong gain euro area business confidence, last 2 bi review 18/2004 summer onwards, suggest growth go gather momentum. while third quarter data seem confirm recovery take hold, activity drive solid pick-up exports, domestic demand remain weak. notwithstanding rise value euro, stimulus strongly grow global economy drive euro area growth. the scenario appear unfold stage one strong export growth would generate recovery production. this would stimulate investment would followed, turn, pick-up consumer spending. although recovery scenario remain broadly place, progress slow. while see externally-led rebound boost industrial production help generate rebound investment, recovery yet become broadly based. in particular, domestic demand remain subdued. to large extent, reflect weakness consumer spending, yet show much sign improvement. there modest recovery consumer confidence since middle last year. continue uncertainty labour market prospect job security help may lead household maintain save somewhat high level precautionary motives. moreover, recently, signal regard nature recovery become somewhat mixed. they continue point expansion, gradual pace. for example, neither level composition recent fourth quarter gdp growth, sluggish consumption net trade offset strong inventory build-up, suggest momentum recovery likely accelerate near term. notwithstanding this, many condition need recovery private demand place. most headwind hold back economic activity past couple year dissipated. real short-term long-term interest rate low, make finance condition favourable. in addition, strong global recovery help offset drag result strengthen euro. however, help ensure recovery continues, pace improvement seem set slow. against background, likely little upward pressure inflation outlook price stability medium-term favourable. that recovery take long gain traction reflect fact still uncertainty risk outlook. in near term, i mention already, relate prospect euro area consumer spending. until improvement front, euro area recovery continue unconvincing. the longer-term risk relate concern sustainability economic growth global level give persistence of, internal external, imbalance part world. both set risk suggest sustainable recovery cannot yet fully take granted, though still remain likely prospect. while view current stance monetary policy remain appropriate, i assure govern council remain vigilant closely watch development come months. exchange rate development i would like say word exchange rate developments, which, course, govern council take account part overall economic analysis. in early year emu, relatively weak exchange rate euro place exporter market outside euro area relatively favourable position. this long case. while exchange rate appreciation help dampen inflation ultimately improve purchase power, also obviously impact net trade position. so far, positive effect strong global growth outweigh negative impact exchange rate appreciation euro area exports. more recently, however, evidence sentiment indicator moderation export orders, industrial production fell january. the euro trend upwards, dollar overall terms, two year now, sizeable movement exchange rate past six months. in particular appreciation euro accelerate considerably dollar also asian currency late 2003 first half january 2004. these movement link imbalance level global economy, u current account deficit. they also reflect fixity asian currency vis-à-vis u dollar, lead depreciate line u currency. the speed strength appreciation euro period raise concern and, gradual smooth correction global imbalance important medium-term issue global economy, must achieve appropriate manner. view bi review 18/2004 3 way, excess volatility disorderly movement exchange rate undesirable. the g-7 statement issue florida 7 february recognise risk. the statement emphasise great flexibility exchange rate desirable major country economic area lack flexibility promote smooth widespread adjustment international financial system, base market mechanisms. while i recognise also factor work, i encourage fact since recent g-7 meeting, see great stability foreign exchange markets. the importance appropriate policy mix i briefly touch issue euro area policy mix. there sometimes misconception single monetary policy way anti-growth. i assure single monetary policy anti-growth. not positive effect i describe early - anchor long-term inflation expectations, thus, facilitate low short long-term interest rate - ethos policy way oppose growth. in fact opposite true. the aim support growth. the maastricht treaty make clear that, primary objective monetary policy price stability, eurosystem should, without prejudice objective, also take account broad economic goal european community. sometimes overlook monetary policy operate tandem policy strong complementarity them. monetary policy successful ensure price stability deliver low short long-term interest rates. however, element sound fiscal policy, stable macroeconomic framework sufficiently flexible labour product market also necessary achieve strong sustainable growth. structural reform reflect this, important commitment irish presidency eu progress structural reform agenda. a member govern council, i welcome initiative. why structural reform issue central bank? there number reasons. increase efficiency market operate raise potential growth. importantly, also, efficiently function economy utilise resource available great extent and, so, le prone inflation. this extend boundary within economic policies, include monetary policy, operate without generate inflation. in effect, economy high growth “speed limit” i.e. able grow fast inflation likely become problem. the structural reform agenda, set lisbon strategy 2000, aim improve function flexibility euro area product labour markets. this achieve raise employment rates, education skill level promote technological innovation. while, term time, nearly halfway lisbon process, progress meet target slow. while eu country undertake initiative labour market reform recent years, achieve target employment rate 70 per cent work age population still far off. moreover, reform need allow wage reflect strongly regional sectoral productivity difference also improve education train systems. the emphasis place issue welcome achievement potential contribute materially boost long run sustainable growth rate euro area. stability growth pact the link monetary fiscal policy is, i think, readily appreciated. the stability growth pact, together maastricht deficit debt objectives, constitute euro area’s fiscal framework. there two main reason need framework. first, give divergent structure centralise monetary exchange rate policy, one hand, decentralise fiscal policy (i.e. national level), other, rule-based fiscal framework necessary avoid conflict monetary fiscal policy. by adhere fiscal rules, within broad framework, divergent fiscal behaviour individual member state contained. this fiscal discipline, turn, support low interest rates, essential good long-term economic performance. secondly, become increasingly important year ahead, low public debt help member state prepare budgetary impact age populations. a aware, however, difficulty application rules. the recent budgetary experience large eurozone country demonstrate clearly problem 4 bi review 18/2004 arise relation 3% deficit limit, especially insufficient provision make economic upturns. the decision ecofin november 25th “hold abeyance time being” excessive deficit procedure country give rise much talk status pact. clearly govern council concern situation, impact action ecb’s core mandate attain maintain price stability, respect commission’s decision seek legal clarity regard. but, important emphasise that, govern council see need change either treaty pact, does, however, agree possible improve implemention certain respects. for instance, analysis structural balance incentive pursue sound fiscal policy good time could strengthen improved. and si also scope enhance clarity enforcability framework overall. these undoubtedely issue consider future. enlargement on 1 may, look forward ten new member european union. while immediate contribution (5 pre cent) level output may relatively modest, stroke area eu expand 25 per cent total population 20 per cent. in due course, also, enlargement could major implication governance ecb. several accede country signal intention adopt euro within next years, and, most, all, may well part euro area end decade. in meantime, much grind covered. the start point accede country that, country join eu, oblige treat exchange rate policy matter common interest context question participation exchange rate mechanism arises. an accede country oblige participate erm ii, expect join mechanism point, subject agreement central rate fluctuation margins. economic condition among accede country differ greatly, far nominal real convergence concerned: give one example, gdp per capita, percentage euro area average, range 37% latvia 80% cyprus; also significant difference unemployment, inflation rates, fiscal positions. it, therefore, make sense that, throughout process lead adoption euro, assessment carry case-by-case basis. participation erm ii something govern council attach considerable importance, preparation rigorous regime lie ahead. for accede countries, however, focus adoption euro, bring considerable benefit term great policy credibility absence exchange risk much external trade. but, ultimately, interest accede country interest successful euro, bottom line adopt euro must able live constraints. hence need adequate preparation adopt euro and, indeed, join exchange rate mechanism. we ireland may something offer experience. some recall early 1980s, 20% inflation twin deficit well double figures. we resolve difficulty late 1980s, still experience pressure exchange rate monetary policy wide band period try achieve nominal convergence, contain pressure generate real convergence. some accede country face similar issues. our experience underscore need policy maker aware change need help prepare emu. but, say that, essentially short-term matters. over long term, positive impact accession eu economy could immense. in particular, i would expect energy dynamism release catching-up process percolate rest eu, least catalyst create competitive environment hasten structural reform. enlargement scale unique, ireland, currently occupy presidency eu, privilege enlargement agenda. conclusion the first five year emu consider success. more three hundred million consumer investor euro area enjoy benefit price stability, low nominal interest rate single money market convenience deal single currency wide geographic area. by maintain price stability, monetary policy provide basis sustainable growth output employment. but, growth materialise, active support fiscal policy structural reform bi review 18/2004 5 also required. i believe grow awareness across euro area need play part address current problem prepare come challenge, especially age populations. i expect issue centre stage next five years. 6 bi review 18/2004 timothy f geithner: change challenge face u financial system remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, new york banker association’s annual

worldwide appear diminished, sign accelerate price increase economies. overall, however, despite sharp increase energy commodity prices, inflation outlook globally appear quite benign. at core u.s. economic experience past decade significant sustain acceleration productivity growth. this offer prospect rapid growth income time, unite state rest world. in economics profession, debate whether midst secular trend characterize low gdp volatility general price stability, call “great moderation.” a important question extent moderation macroeconomic volatility debate source. it’s undoubtedly result combination factors, include good economic policy, innovation globalization, plus simple good fortune form small shocks. but, relative contribution factor uncertain. despite uncertainty exist source durability apparent moderation type risks, financial market price reflect benign view economic credit fundamentals. credit spread generally risk premia many asset class level low even relation

nonperforming loan ratio 1.2 percent across commercial bank industry. the financial market price financial institution risk favorable levels, bank equity prices, subordinate debt spreads, credit default swap spread suggest high degree investor counterparty confidence financial health major bank financial institutions. a number suggest, u.s. financial system come recent recession, spate corporate bankruptcies, sharp adjustment asset prices, difficulty bi review 18/2004 1 emerge market economy reasonably strong financial shape. this apparent resilience, relative past downturn relative experience countries, result number factors. some factor stem development outside financial system, like good macroeconomic policy good microeconomic supply-side fundamentals. and stem change nature financial intermediation, structure financial system, capacity financial institution manage risk. to start broad economic context, strength length expansion 1990s help ensure u.s. financial institution enter late recession strong capital positions. the fact recession shallow short average past help limit scale scope loss financial institutions. the forcefulness monetary policy response large fiscal stimulus provide tax cut expenditure increase play significant role limit depth downturn help bring recovery. it significant yield curve steep stay steep long late recession previous one. and, finally, strong microeconomic fundamental u.s. economy - shift just-in-time inventory management, speed innovation u.s. economy, factor seem reduce amplitude business cycle improve flexibility

klaus liebscher, governor austrian national bank, epp-ed group study days, vienna, 23 march 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, past three year frequently cite brilliant european economy. trigger adverse international developments, growth sluggish stagnate majority member states. partly result, fiscal policy number member state slip sharply deficit, threaten credibility stability growth pact. progress implementation lisbon agenda slow hop for, lisbon agenda accord enough importance observers. i want argue today thing really bad. • europe successfully manage achieve economic convergence among present 15 member states. • europe successfully introduce single currency 12 nations. • europe design impressive agenda structural reform lisbon summit, progress made. • and europe show remarkable persistence pursuit ambitious agenda development. eastern enlargement, future history book quote landmark achievement path toward european integration, become reality little month’s time, work draft constitutional treaty far advanced, eu mean short important project near future. however, i also argue must complacent. in today’s globalized, fast-moving economy, ever stand still - move slowly - tantamount fall behind. to mind, euro success story several respects. that outstanding project realize bear witness europe’s push forward integration. that introduction go smoothly testimony creativity, project management capacity cooperative spirit everyone involved. the euro make life easier. the euro also protect economy large extent foreign exchange turbulence. today, economy - completely, considerable extent - shield up down u.s. dollar (just recall would mean erm i early 1990s!). moreover, eurosystem’s monetary policy establish sustainable price stability euro area. inflation expectation stabilize slightly 2%. this signal high credibility eurosystem enjoy professional analysts, financial market general public. that success become possible background last consensus among european politician price stability important goal - right precondition sustainable growth. i mention must never become complacent. we take appeal seriously eurosystem. the quarterly bank lend survey, new euro area-wide interest rate statistic various measure inflation expectation derive survey example continuous effort ecb ncb staff make improve quality diversity information source employ prepare govern council’s monetary policy decisions. the govern council also undertake major review monetary policy strategy last spring, result several refinement structure monetary policy consideration communicate public. lady gentlemen, ecb govern council note progress fiscal consolidation envisage member states’ stability programs. nonetheless, continue cause concern. in countries, contrary commitments, adjustment effort insufficient mitigate risk excessive deficits. moreover, several country plan attain sound budgetary position end respective program horizons, despite favorable growth prospects. this would risk repetition bi review 17/2004 1 policy error last economic upswing, insufficient consolidation effort tax cut without adequate expenditure restraint lay foundation recent fiscal difficulties. all member state would benefit strengthen sustainability public finances. determine implementation comprehensive structural fiscal reforms, expenditure side revenue side, bring additional medium-term reward form high growth sustainable public finances. such consolidation reform strategy need secure sound macroeconomic environment euro area, turn enhance confidence promote investment, growth employment euro area. a regard institutional framework fiscal policy, govern council ecb share concern european commission regard conclusion ecofin council november last year. the commission guardian treaty, eurosystem respect commission’s decision seek legal clarity implementation stability growth pact. we see need change treaty, consider stability growth pact appropriate current form. it provide appropriate incentive structure national policymakers within multi-country monetary union. if apply appropriately, framework ensure long-term sustainability sufficient room automatic smooth business cycles. the govern council agree commission implementation stability growth pact could improved, particular term analysis structural imbalance strengthen incentive sound fiscal policy good economic times. the clarity enforceability fiscal framework enhanced. let me, aside, note austria successfully manage implement fiscal consolidation plan past four years. the austrian example show structural cut fiscal deficit need entail below-average macroeconomic growth. a recent research european commission shows, fiscal consolidation cut expenditure le likely entail short-run growth-dampening effect consolidation rely raise taxes. while recent tax cut number european governments, include austria, principle appropriate give high public expenditure-to-gdp ratios, government use come economic upswing bring budget balance mainly cut expenditures. there general consensus euro area urgently require structural reform financial, product labor markets. the lisbon strategy provide appropriate blueprint progress. i think much compare current situation lisbon agenda state emu mid-1990s. • then project historical dimension high priority eu’s economic development stake. • then lot scepticism project’s viability timetable. • then appear lackluster support european leaders. the decisive move bring emu back track mid-1990s meet euroepan council madrid december 1995. at meeting, date introduction european currency, january 1, 1999, step necessary reach goal name “euro” decided. this important guidance european leadership establish “pioneering mood.” it trigger necessary work various technical level deal preparation emu. and, importantly, create confidence european leadership problem-solving capacity general public. i therefore welcome forthcoming spring meet european council set give renew impetus lisbon agenda, speed pace reform strengthen effectiveness decision-making process. if do correctly necessary commitment behalf member states, european leader able manage revival lisbon agenda comparable achieve decade ago emu. structural reform enormous benefit citizen euro area. these reform crucial sustain noninflationary growth employment, therefore also important maintain social cohesion long run. confidence among european citizen future vital 2 bi review 17/2004 strong economic recovery stable growth. the continue low level consumer confidence also relate uncertainty appropriate path structural reform many euro area countries. further progress implementation necessary structural reform key strong confidence, reform create condition consumption investment, growth job creation. let emphasize point opinion crucial successful revival lisbon agenda. • a first message is: enough talk, time action! the necessary reform area sufficiently discuss clearly identified. we need reform paper now, need implementation. • a second message is: set clear priority use intelligent sequencing! otherwise politician electorate simply overwhelm discouraged. • a third message is: create clear responsibility ! it sufficient european leader issue declaration conclusion “the community” need do. we need bind commitment member state concrete reform step implement 2010. the maastricht convergence criterion would probably never fulfil reliance general intention community require price stability, sound public finance like. you need break objective national level create incentive ensure implementation. • a fourth message is: talk people get actively involved! i think major obstacle implementation lisbon agenda various government lack communication public. it thus surprise seem rather difficult people accept reforms. thus, member state government need convince citizen enormous potential opportunity release structural reforms. after all, aim high per caput income, replace redundant activity welfare-generating ones, investment skill education, knowledge-based society, innovation sufficient research development. i would think objective genuinely positive nature possible convince people reform step necessary reach them. at time, one - cannot - conceal reform necessary way painful unpleasant, affect various group society different ways. in case strong conflict interest important enter active, constructive dialogue jointly find acceptable, fair solutions, since, long run, government afford ignore public opinion. i think official document prepare ahead forthcoming european council already touch course i outlined, feel sufficiently. let conclude quote robert schuman’s legendary declaration may 9, 1950: “europe make once, accord single plan. it build concrete achievements.” i think statement true today half century ago. it become even relevant enlarge european union 25 member states. while european leadership become ever important, european union function well individual player perform role responsibly. this apply division labour monetary, fiscal structural policy division

policy economic outlook speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), sr-banken, stavanger, 19 march 2004. the text may differ slightly actual presentation. the address base assessment present norge bank’s press conference follow executive board’s monetary policy meet 11 march, inflation report 1/04 previous speeches. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. * * * the operational target monetary policy define government inflation close 2.5 per cent time. the target symmetrical - important avoid inflation rate low inflation rate high. the inflation target provide economic agent anchor inflation expectations. it therefore influence decision concern saving, investment, budget wages. history show long-term trade-off low unemployment strong economic growth high inflation. we witness 1980s growth low inflation high. the task monetary policy provide nominal anchor. low stable inflation anchor. there several reason advantage inflation high zero: • the structure economy flux. demand labour different qualification changing. this require change relative wages. there rigidity nominal wage growth. nominal wage readily fall. with inflation, relative wage change without fall nominal wages. there may also rigidity price good services. some degree inflation thus oil economic machinery. • in periods, inflation economic growth low. it appropriate real interest rate low, even negative. nominal interest rate cannot set zero. if inflation become entrench low level near zero, interest rate le effective instrument. • there different way measure inflation. the consumer price index tend overestimate actual inflation. the important source measurement error probably difficulty distinguish change quality price goods. in countries, find show consumer price index overestimate actual inflation order ½-1 per cent. the inflation target vehicle for, obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution stabilise output employment. this objective also express regulation monetary policy. if demand good service high shortage labour, normally prospect high inflation. when interest rate increased, demand fall inflation keep bay. if demand low unemployment rises, prospect low inflation. the interest rate lowered. in long run, output determine supply labour capital adaptability, short medium term monetary policy also impact real economy. the economy grow time. output move waves. output period lie trend growth others trend. the difference trend output actual output call output gap. stabilise output growth mean one seek maintain actual output near trend. the output gap provide indication pressure real economy. development output gap provide basis assess output stability thus also shed light domestic inflationary pressure economy. when economy booming, output gap positive. when economy low ebb, output gap negative. we pronounce economic cycle norwegian economy. the downturn begin 1990s follow upturn 1993. this upturn peak 1998. there shift recovery period strong expansion. growth come halt 2002. an upturn progress. bi review 16/2004 1 other indicator may also shed light stability output employment. the wage gap indicator social partners’ perception employment labour shortages. the wage gap measure difference actual wage growth growth time consistent inflation target, indicator labour market tightness. with estimate productivity growth 2 per cent, wage growth 4.5 per cent time consistent inflation target 2.5 per cent. in chart, wage gap 2000, i.e. introduction inflation target, define difference wage growth norway countries. this wage gap appear closely line output gap measure norge bank. normally, interest rate set view achieve inflation 2½% two-year horizon. norge bank operate flexible inflation target regime, weight give variability inflation well variability output employment. monetary policy affect economy lag. the choice two-year horizon thus base strike balance variability inflation variability output employment, perception interest rate influence variables. if extraordinary condition prompt norge bank apply different time horizon two years, bank provide assessment this. the apply special emphasis place development financial markets. external cyclical development event considerable implication development norwegian economy. the international upturn come halt 2000. the bubble equity market burst. many year high investment lead excess capacity industries, unemployment increased. the terrorist attack 11 september 2001 put new damp economic activity. from summer 2002 spring 2003, highly extraordinary accumulation negative event global community - account scandals, fear terror, war disease - put brake growth. u interest rates, sharply reduce begin downturn, subsequently reduce further. interest rate also remain low euro area. key rate historically low several important trade partners. long-term interest rate also low. the economic situation norway remain firm long period, wage growth surprisingly high 2002. there le scope low interest rate among trade partners. a result, interest rate differential country widened. this impact krone exchange rate developments. in addition, special circumstance global economy lead strong krone might expect high interest rate differential alone. theme foreign exchange market shift. in periods, investor focus stock return fee exchange rate movements. during period political economic unrest, investor may choose individual currency safe haven. in autumn 2002, norwegian krone probably also perceive safe haven. in past 12-18 months, development interest rate differential norway country appear particularly mark impact currency. norwegian interest rate push towards level prevail abroad. in 2003, interest rate differential narrow result monetary policy easing. the interest rate reduce 5¼ percentage point approximately among trade partners. the krone depreciate 6 per cent past year krone exchange rate, measure import-weighted index i-44, level prevail march 2002. this approximately par average 1990s. in past days, krone appreciate somewhat. in february, inflation stand –0.1 per cent. apart temporary, technical factor together account 3-4 tenth percentage point, three main factor contribute substantial deviation inflation target: • first, global downturn considerable implication impact interest-rate set norway, via exchange rate instance. • second, low external inflation rapid shift international division labour result fall price import good services. this also apply price measure term norwegian importer pay foreign currency. the change trade pattern make considerable contribution sharp decline price clothing, footwear audiovisual equipment. rapid technological advance also push price audiovisual equipment. 2 bi review 16/2004 • third, competition probably increase retail industry service sector norway recent years. initially, heighten competition affect companies’ profit margins. but enterprise respond reduce costs. this occur part individual business, subcontractor also require reduce price enhance efficiency. therefore, increase competition usually trigger high productivity growth economy. low inflation may therefore match growth productivity. price domestically produce good service expect rise towards begin 2005 due high capacity utilisation norwegian economy. strong employment growth may contribute somewhat high wage growth 2004. at time, domestically produce good service affect exchange rate changes, albeit long lag case import consumer goods. there clear sign global economy pass trough. however, outlook brighter, price inflation still low interest rate keep unusually low. economic growth high us, still excess production capacity low inflation. workforce reduction may long severe, company still hire new staff. it may take time interest rate increase substantially us. growth asia solid, global rise interest rate unlikely start there. inflation high euro area u approximately line objective define european central bank. in euro area, however, capacity utilisation low, unemployment high outlook growth weaker. recently, inflation moderate slightly. against background, probably also take time interest rate rise markedly euro area. interest rate abroad unusually low 2½ years, appear remain low period ahead. this pose challenge monetary policy norway. growth norwegian economy pick up. low interest rate contribute sustain growth private consumption. household demand probably important drive force norwegian economy period ahead. against background high real income growth, improve job security expectation continue low interest rate ahead, household consumption expect exhibit strong growth. petroleum investment exhibit brisk growth 2003. growth petroleum investment would appear continue 2004, probably slow rate 2003. low interest rate house price inflation imply high house investment period ahead. fiscal policy also contribute stimulate activity. the impact interest rate decline private consumption likely strong year 2003. it take time change norge bank’s key rate fee fully interest rate households. norge bank’s calculation show look 2003 2004 whole, appear impact interest rate change result overall reduction nok 15bn household net interest expense tax. however, due increase household net debt, net interest expense fall much le this. the impact interest rate decline also condition expect duration low interest rate level. when sight deposit rate reduce last autumn, long interest rate show relatively little change. the interest rate reduction december january, combine decline inflation, strong impact long-term interest rates. this indicate financial market participant expect interest rate remain low long period. the fall value krone past year strengthen norwegian business industry. with low wage growth norway pick-up global activity, prospect norwegian manufacture business sector bright 12-18 month ago. the business sector is, however, still feel effect sharp rise labour cost period several years. relative labour cost measure common currency line level prevail 1990, approximately 10 per cent high mid-1990s. the internationally expose sector scale back. those company still operate may good position bear high wage level. bi review 16/2004 3 in 2003, employment investment fell, although investment pick somewhat towards end year. efficiency-enhancing measure expect continue mark development business sector year. this curb demand labour. the situation vary across business sectors. distributive trade enterprise supply service household expand result high growth private consumption. production business market fell 2003. demand service market segment pick pace rise manufacture output industries. strong competition result substantial restructuring. manufacture production move norway country lower-cost countries. this may continue. eu eea enlargement 10 new member 1 may may also increase competition industries, particularly service sector. investment onshore industry western norway northern norway generate positive impetus construction industry. activity 2003 rest country mainly hold public investment projects. information regional network indicate construction activity pick markedly regions. this also apply rogaland. in recent year, non-residential investment account third total investment service distributive trades. the large investment sector latter half 1990s lead high non-residential vacancy rate. statistic norway’s new price index non-residential commercial property show norway whole, price peak first half 2001 since fall 9 per cent first half 2003. this situation likely curb overall investment growth year ahead. in 2004, many company probably realise gain provide efficiency measure implemented. continue brisk growth household demand expect boost investment activity 2005 2006. petroleum investment also increase result orme lange project. this also case rogaland. our regional network report demand increase, market outlook next six month favourable corporate profitability improve considerably. the economic upturn primarily reinforce drive strong household demand, although without substantial increase investment employment. the upturn broaden gain momentum past months. all sector report stable increase demand sales. the market outlook next six month county positive. optimism translate strong willingness invest, however. the picture petroleum offshore supply industry mixed. operators’ production oil gas high. some sector offshore supply industry experience difficult fourth quarter, optimistic year. the maintenance modification market show steady, although moderate, growth. most company report stable employment. extensive rationalisation restructure measure still agenda organisation enterprises, far, growth absorb excess capacity increase productivity. wholesale retail trade build construction sector increase workforces. all industry continue report highly qualify labour ample supply. of norwegian county export traditional goods, rogaland third largest. the public sector private service industry important employment rogaland rest norway, share employment sector low national average. manufacture oil gas production important rogaland, internationally expose sector also relatively large. employment rogaland mainly concentrate engineering, shipbuilding construction oil platforms. many also employ food beverage industry, rogaland important farm county. the labour market norway improved. the number person employ norway begin increase summer 2003 unemployment stabilised. employment distributive trade increased. there also sign employment rise education, public sector health social services, weak level record first six month last year. manufacture employment remain well level one year early fourth quarter 2003, fall slow pace. unemployment fairly stable. adjust seasonal variations, lf 4 bi review 16/2004 unemployment stand 4.6 per cent labour force measure statistic norway’s labour force survey (lfs) fourth quarter 2003. growth household demand, petroleum investment increase activity business sector pave way rise employment period ahead. on hand, intensify competition continue rationalisation business sector may dampen impact labour demand. this year, employment growth expect fairly moderate even sharp rise output. only slight decrease unemployment project 2004. unemployment project edge 2005 2006. after several year high wage growth, pay increase last year’s settlement moderate. annual wage growth nonetheless 4½% substantial increase effect 2003 award 2002 main wage settlement. wage growth project decline 3¾% year. the labour market appear improve somewhat rapidly expect previously. in isolation, may contribute push wage growth relative previous projections. the effect is, however, expect offset prospect low inflation year. in 2005 2006, wage growth project increase result tight labour market high inflation. there tendency recent year large portion pay increase agree first year two-year period cover main agreement. if consider two-year period together, estimate relationship wage growth development labour market approximately line observe since mid-1990s. development real economic variable mirror credit markets. in recent years, household income show solid growth, household confidence high. however, corporate earn low, recently enterprise primarily focus enhance efficiency. credit development give ambiguous signal interest-rate setting. growth household borrow high, enterprise reduce debt. the change breakdown credit may amplify banks’ increase eagerness extend credit household period loss loan business sector. some report regional network indicate restraint credit business sector areas. development credit enterprise shadow development investments. low credit growth indicate mainland business investment yet pick up. total credit expand broadly line normal growth nominal gdp. norwegian household generally finance mortgage interest rate follow short-term money market rate. float interest rate tend vary widely time. the interest rate level low present, long-term investment cannot rely interest rate span life house loan. accord money market expectations, interest rate eventually stabilise around 5½ per cent. this consistent inflation target 2½ per cent long-term real interest rate line level abroad. this interest rate, mark-up banks’ margins, provide realistic expression interest rate level apply loan’s life float interest rate prevail today. it may prove particularly challenge borrower ass debt-servicing capacity time period interest rate abnormally low. such low interest rate also place particular demand bank assess creditworthiness borrowers. but experience show underlie cause loan default overly optimistic assessment part lender borrower. house price development household credit influence consumption house investment. we seek take account indirect effect interest-rate setting. household debt increase sharply past decade. development debt 1990s may partly interpret delay adaptation deregulation house credit market 1980s many household experience financial difficulty follow relaxation. household asset debt house wealth rise markedly fast pace disposable income, house wealth grow net debt 1994 present. the norwegian economy experience upturn downturn since 1994, activity approximately par level prevail 1994. these change must therefore regard structural changes. we limit scope restrain structural change occur household increase debt several year invest house property assets. an interest rate would bi review 16/2004 5 effectively restrain structural adjustment would also adverse impact output employment. the interest rate use reduce credit demand. at present - low interest rate abroad close link domestic interest rate krone - tight monetary policy restrain credit demand primarily job security would reduced. household credit demand closely link development house market. home-owners see value dwell rise possibility take new mortgage-secured loans. they free portion home equity value finance consumption investments. house price norway average rise 9 per cent annually 1995 2002. house price also increase considerably countries. a sharp sustain rise house price might contribute high credit growth even price level off. since portion house stock sell year, dwell sell high price last sell long period. this contribute sustain high level growth credit household norway even rise house price moderate 2002 2003. it easy sell dwell large city specific area particularly attractive. residential property fairly liquid attractive investment. a persistently high rate increase house price may isolation engender expectation rise may thus prove self-reinforcing period. moreover, seem tendency towards invest property incur loan mature age young generation inherit dwellings, debt well. both debt wealth rise mature age groups. sharp increase asset price debt accumulation may pose risk economic stability. with view mitigate risk, appropriate situation apply somewhat longer-than-normal time horizon two year attain inflation target. however, present debt accumulation high household sector. there little borrow activity enterprise sector. house price rising, non-residential property price stable. price office premise are, however, stable. the analysis inflation report indicate inflation remain low year, pick thereafter. the krone depreciation since january 2003 expect push price import consumer goods. overall, mainland gdp growth project pick markedly year remain relatively high 2005 2006. gdp growth project reach 3¼ per cent 2004 2005, follow slight decline 2¾ per cent 2006. with path total output, output gap, measure here, shift slightly positive 2005 2006 slightly negative year. projection base technical assumption interest rate move line forward rates. the assumption imply interest rate somewhat low near term, rise gradually summer, largely parallel increase interest rate among trade partners. the krone assume follow path forward exchange rate, indicate expectation fairly stable exchange rate period ahead. a path line projection previous inflation report (ir 1/04) provide reasonable balance prospect reach inflation target stable development real economy. the aim monetary policy high inflation. it appropriate particularly vigilant regard development consumer prices, consumer price may show random variation one month next. late year, receive confirmation whether consumer price rise line projections. when inflation increase low level, provide basis gradually move towards normal short-term interest rate level norway. this may counter excessive credit growth excessive pressure domestic resource medium term. interest rate development country may also considerable impact krone hence norwegian interest rates. at meet 11 march, executive board decide reduce interest rate 0.25 percentage point. in reach decision, executive board weigh objective bring inflation back target stabilise inflation expectation risk output growth may eventually become strong. furthermore, accord executive board’s assessment, sight deposit rate 1.75 per cent present, probability inflation two year ahead low 2½ per cent great probability higher. 6 bi review 16/2004 lars heikensten: economic recovery low inflationary pressure speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, meet residenset härnösand, 15 march 2004. * * * allow begin thank invitation today’s meeting. in order get idea economic development different area sweden explain riksbank works, i pay regular visit various part country. the item agenda today’s visit include talk mid sweden university riksbank works, visit sca discussion county representative development business labour market västernorrland. at lunch, i intend give view economic situation monetary policy. before go economic assessment itself, however, i would like say word riksbank’s work methods. one riksbank’s objective maintain price stability. we decide define 2 per cent inflation measure consumer price index, tolerance range plus/minus 1 percentage point. monetary policy conduct basis forecast inflation primarily come two years. if forecast perspective indicate inflation low 2 per cent, repo rate normally cut vice versa. the reason focus inflation 1-2 year ahead monetary policy affect economy inflation certain time lag. this approach serve u well decade conduct monetary policy inflation target. since target adopted, inflation large average 2 per cent. at time, experience good general economic progress two precede decades. the clear target couple mode action also help make riksbank’s policy accessible public financial markets. inflation expectation anchor fairly stably around target possible predict action rather well. nevertheless, cause underline run autopilot mechanically change repo rate relation inflation forecasts. there may reason u wait take decision order able perform in-depth analysis obtain information. there may also reason take account additional aspect decision rather inflation 1-2 year ahead. such aspect could include economy general would affected, inflation longer- shorter-term perspective impact financial stability. but important framework explicit possible, clearly define state objectives. in way, everyone follow line reasoning, question comment it. monetary policy effective firmly established. international upswing continue both real economic activity inflation sweden highly dependent development abroad. broadly speaking, demand economic growth since end last summer follow path expect riksbank time subsequently. however, see entire period, growth u somewhat fast anticipated. this also apply situation asia eastern central europe. condition different western europe, particularly core country euro area - germany, france italy. here, demand rise expect upswing delayed. what happen since riksbank’s last decision repo rate february follow pattern. recent development u economy also unexpectedly positive. this also apply large part asia, lead china japan. in addition, number sweden’s important export market uk norway appear perform somewhat good anticipated. a regard euro area, recent data indeed suggest recovery industry take root time domestic demand continue weak. the situation china deserve special mention. since 1990, output china grow average rate 9 per cent per year. over past three years, 8 per cent. this mean china’s share global output double 6 per cent 13 per cent. this situation bi review 16/2004 1 great significance world economy today. china emerge one world’s major importer commodities, especially regard crude oil, copper agricultural products. for example, china’s import copper total le 15 per cent world trade copper 2002, compare couple per cent 1990. at time, chinese export manufacture good increase rapidly, currently account 6 per cent world export compare 2 per cent 1990. when today see unusually big gap international price inflation manufacture goods, presently exceptionally slow, commodities, instead fast, probably somewhat due happen china. my overall view international economic activity continue strengthen year ahead largely expect before. growth oecd area could reach 3 per cent year average around 2005 2006. this marginally high expect imply slightly good export conditions. international price manufacture good likely rise tandem economic recovery. but much uncertain. there strong argument suggest increase price could slow usual background globalisation weak price inflation manufacture goods. point opposite direction increase commodity prices, could great impact demand accelerate further. however, future price commodity are, anything, indicate future price declines. demand sweden line previous forecast the swedish economy come recent economic slowdown comparatively well, growth past three year average around 1.5 per cent per year. this important remember order get perspective outcome conduct economic policy employment fall somewhat. an important reason economic activity weak household consumption relatively high. this bolster loose fiscal policy low interest rates. the relatively weak krona also boost swedish export result considerable trade surplus. swedish economic development largely follow path describe riksbank late summer autumn 2003. growth gradually strengthen line international demand. at time, private consumption continue relatively high. investment remain weak, however. this picture confirm late national accounts. growth full year 2003 judge 1.6 per cent. however, mark change course 2003; first second half year growth rise 1.4 1.8 per cent. the situation present upswing industry progress somewhat. export demand gather pace, firm fairly optimistic future. it also appear capacity utilisation industry continue rise. export unexpectedly strong final two quarter last year, business tendency data point continue optimism period ahead. households’ expectation regard finance swedish economy also begin rise fall somewhat end last year. retail sale figure indicate continuation robust consumption. low interest rates, rise equity price low inflation boost consumption period ahead well. while subject household consumption allow say something recent discussion household indebtedness. debt proportion households’ disposable income continue grow last year, debt ratio approach level see sharp expansion credit end 1980s. at time, low interest rate mean households’ interest cost percentage income historically low level. the latter mean great problem today household sector bear debt even debt course limit households’ scope consumption near future. so situation hardly constitute macroeconomic problem present. in actual fact, one aim low interest rate exactly create condition household reduce save maintain consumption weak economic climate. in spite this, reason riksbank monitor development carefully. there also good reason individual household reflect debt situation. interest rate unusually low present probably change future. on whole, reason make mark adjustment overall outlook demand swedish economy come year compare december february. most factor still indicate growth household consumption continue stable around 2.5 per cent 2 bi review 16/2004 year ahead. the contribution growth export probably somewhat high previously expected, large part effect demand offset fact could also case imports. local government consumption appear somewhat weak think december. investment source uncertainty could probably pick somewhat late forecast. on whole, therefore, gdp growth may roughly expect december inflation report take decision february, reach around 2.5 per cent per year year ahead. low domestic cost pressure in words, outlook autumn far remain largely intact, economic activity strengthen expected. the situation different domestic cost pressure. in respect, since middle autumn 2003, new data gradually receive warrant change view inflation situation. these relate labour market, weak expect consequence assessment wage developments, productivity, rise anticipated, low cost pressure result, finally actual inflation, low expected, effect also inflation expectations, decline somewhat. employment growth therefore weak expected, particularly end last year. the apply number hour worked. the weak employment growth couple low number labour market policy measure result high unemployment. this rise 4.5 per cent february last year 6.0 per cent february year. business tendency data indicator currently suggest employment growth private sector relatively weak 2004. there sign labour market may turn, weak. very recently, example, number new job vacancy increase slightly redundancy notice declined. at time, strain financial situation public sector point weak employment growth local government period ahead well. thus, employment growth likely somewhat weak year compare december forecast. a early february, change somewhat outlook rate wage increase result situation labour market. there reason expect total rise wage cost average around 3.5 per cent 2004 2005, term average collectively agree level leaf little room 2 per cent average year ahead. the wage bargain round appear far go relatively well, historical experience swedish wage formation suggest one cautious assume home dry. the party appear far agreement number issues, risk conflict arising. a long agreement reach moderate level inflation perspective, long agreement period preferable. this would alleviate future uncertainty thereby contribute good economic situation. so employment, measure number hour worked, business sector weak expect last year, gdp growth roughly line riksbank’s expectations. this mean productivity high anticipated. this picture confirm late national account data underline early december assessment. since become clearer, somewhat good productivity important argument rate cut february. it likely robust productivity partly due development economic activity; begin recovery, exist production resource utilise efficiently revival establish rise investment new job begin earnest. but explanation enough since productivity appear rise normal give economic situation. this pattern clear u also somewhat discernible sweden. one possible interpretation due unusually large-scale investment in, instance, it end 1990s. it also conceivable reflect permanent change could related, example, technological advance it telecommunications. at present, possible determine exactly cause improvement productivity. however, look ahead come years, see reason expect good productivity outlook december. the new inflation data receive also point somewhat subdue inflationary pressure. the decline inflation see last six month large extent line bi review 16/2004 3 riksbank’s previous forecasts. the reason electricity price adjust downwards expected. the fact expect decline confirm positive inflation outlook since risk contagion part economy diminishes. these risk also decrease rent agreement least far conclude moderate levels. in addition, inflation outcome recent month low expect reason well. this partly due low import prices, although domestic underlie inflation also somewhat low previous forecasts. inflation monetary policy permit summarise view demand inflation period ahead. it appear international economic activity progress largely expected. compare december, perhaps reason expect marginally strong activity due mainly rapid growth asia us. economic development sweden also essentially follow path expected, even certain shift different demand component private sector consumption particularly export grow slightly faster, growth local government consumption probably somewhat weaker. in all, still reason expect gdp growth year ahead somewhat high riksbank belief sustainable long term. for inflation year ahead, course important unutilised resource begin with. so expect term inflation developments? in respect, outlook gradually undergo number mark change since end autumn. principally, result low expect increase wage cost good productivity growth, unit labour cost expect today compare december grow number tenth slow year ahead. normally, factor significant inflation year ahead unit labour costs. in addition, international price pressure muted. against background, factor suggest inflation next two year riksbank’s target. also regard various risk economic activity inflation, i believe cause reason somewhat differently december. a economic upswing gradually confirmed, risk setback come two year diminish. correspondingly, probability economic activity could prove unexpectedly positive upswing quick anticipate also likely increase. however, mean downside risk whatsoever short term. one risk weak labour market u sweden - confirm late data - worry household dampen consumption. it seem unlikely, however, upswing could derail entirely reason. a regard inflationary pressure, number question mark i mention earlier. we don’t know long recent rise productivity last. in inflation outlook i presented, consideration give new data. at time, good argument point high low productivity growth. the apply view international inflation. a regard wages, also risk upside, essentially relate way wage formation sweden conducted. it still rule entirely wage bargain round derailed. should outcome prove high expected, likely impact future level interest rates. so far i say anything exchange rate. there may reason touch upon this. for long time, expect krona appreciation course forecast period would bring u level approximately line believe appropriate long term, give mainly competitiveness swedish economy. during period 2002-2003 whole, krona strengthen roughly expected. recently, however, strengthen curbed. one reason appear expect relative interest rates, certain shift since autumn. there may reason take account expect somewhat less probability krona appreciation. on whole, discussion different uncertainty factor risk lead see reason make appreciable change assessment i presented. the risk i discuss could perhaps push inflation somewhat. nevertheless, know today, conclusion remain inflation riksbank’s target one two year ahead. by way conclusion, allow stress much work remain do next inflation report publish form basis decision repo rate end 4 bi review 16/2004 march. so today’s assessment could affect new data. in light analysis currently carry out, executive board may ass factor significant inflation different way i today. thank you. bi review 16/2004 5 p m w tucker: keynote speech napf annual investment conference keynote speech mr p m w tucker, executive director member

15% march 2003 low, even fall since second half last week. and default risk corporate bond market seem recede - partly reflect balance sheet restructure amongst large corporates side atlantic, aid low yield encourage firm extend debt maturities. these improvement asset market have, course, reflect contribute strong global macroeconomic conditions. i recently ask conference whether external environment matter uk monetary policy - goal specify term preserve domestic purchase power, look beyond domestic economy? in fact, course, highly open economy, uk much affect international conditions: either u euro area. indeed, year now, uk monetary policy direct offset weakness external environment. in words, stimulate domestic spend order keep aggregate demand le line expansion economy’s productive potential, consistent keep inflation expectation line target. in term mandate, worked: inflation stay pretty close target, average 2.3% rpix measure since begin 2000. but familiar, accompany accumulate ‘imbalances’ economy, manifest variety way - weak manufacture strong services; consumption grow well long run average rate past three years, rapidly disposable income since; rapid accumulation debt household sector alongside burgeon house price inflation. that strategy principle always limits, whether would test - whether would identify - depended, part, external prospects. other thing equal, healthy international environment, could withdraw stimulus domestic spending. for policy, significance recovery past year us. until last summer, risk look pretty clearly weight downside relative central projection fairly rapid return trend level output. but, decline five quarters, business investment spend u bounce back since q2, output recover rapidly back towards trend capacity utilisation rising. risk nevertheless remain. for last autumn look like recovery demand accompany similarly robust job growth, since december net job creation fall back well average rate growth workforce. commentator - policymakers, say - take two view this. the first view see employment pick environment sustain output growth reduce scope, time, extract great efficiency current labour capital input rate recently achieved. that’s persuasive, particularly u monetary policy remain accommodative. the view worry protract weakness job market could dent household confidence spending, slow output growth. u survey suggest sentiment sensitive job prospects, far spend remain robust, house price inflation (over 3½% quarter-on-quarter q4). my take likely outlook positive downside risk have, again, become tangible. i think fair say analysis euro area tough - monetary policy financial stability side business. essentially, reflect le timely rich data, together 2 bi review 17/2004 vary regional condition - economic story - across area. for time now, forecast recovery. that base stimulative monetary policy - short real rate around zero euro area whole - recovery consumer and, particularly, business confidence. sign recovery have, though, recently apparent survey data. in particular, domestic demand remain weak, although pick france q4. in germany, household spend subdued, investment (at current prices) low relative economy-wide output time since unification. on one hand, suggest plenty scope recovery back trend levels. but, hand, risk - perhaps high - trend output growth bit. if so, adverse knock-on effect part euro area, would create downside risk u euro area far large trade partner. for moment, i continue place great weight encourage surveys. the euro area may big trade partner, condition rest world make quite difference us, directly indirectly. in fact, growth strong part asia 2002-03, ‘rest world’ contribute percentage point average uk-weighted world output growth. the outlook various part asia far east may mean second engine global growth alongside us. the domestic picture also gradually change since autumn. last october, upward revision q2 gdp data, pick business surveys, greater-than-expected strength house market. take alongside diminish risk external environment, enough vote 25bp rise. i regard unwind committee’s july cut, i view ‘precautionary’ ‘insurance’ downside risk apparent. in event, mpc’s rate raise month later, november, since debate course policy alter somewhat. there reference ‘caution’ raise rates, move ‘gradually’ medium-term inflationary pressure mount. i hope i provide clarity term mean me. our january minute record economy evolve envisage november inflation report, inflationary pressure gradually building, gradual rise interest rate would necessary. we similar position now. the february increase mpc’s rate, bring 4%, leaf policy stimulate economy. indeed, i prefer think recent policy adjustment withdraw - - previous stimulus. if, projected, output continue grow trend then, depend course development affect outlook, i one would expect u continue gradually reduce degree stimulus demand broadly line take slack economy consequent pick inflationary pressure look ahead. that seem le view market, reflect february inflation report projection use market interest rates; imply forward curve, derive index-linked gilts, short-maturity real rate relative longer-maturity real rates, principle affect cyclical variation (chart 1). while policy must forward-looking rather overly focus current rate inflation, 1.3% february obviously 2% cpi target, already evidence inflationary pressure. look category good service cpi basket, median rate inflation rise past year so, 70th 30th percentile (ie cut category price rise least order exclude erratic changes) (chart 2). but take month time. a month passes, data may reveal outlook either weak strong expected. this take say ‘caution’ raise rates, time perhaps misconstrue imply ‘hesitant’. the idea care extent inflation vary around target so, amongst things, degree uncertainty effect inflation change interest rate. the mark increase household debt somewhat increase uncertainty. with high debt relative incomes, interest rate change tend big effect income household free spend service debts. but know sensitivity are. the implication that, thing equal, policy would tend move towards neutral slowly would otherwise optimal, ‘cautiously’ want good word. but care need here, development economy associate debt accumulation possible implications. i want mention two. bi review 17/2004 3 first, household borrow grow alongside robust house market. the ratio house price earn 40 percentage point since 2001. the increase value collateral consequently available household secure borrow has, unsurprisingly, evident mortgage equity withdrawal, percentage personal disposable income estimate reach around 7% third quarter last year. some borrow probably substitute expensive unsecured debt; use finance consumption. either way, increase collateral value plausibly reduce credit constraint face households. if so, thing equal, short-run effect may increase slightly level interest rate output inflation stabilised. so underlie phenomenon could one effect optimal path interest rates. the second point that, although deceleration since end 2002, house price continue rise rapidly expect recent months. this especially london south east england thing. over past nine month so, price rise strongly north england, scotland wales. indeed, regional dispersion house price inflation remain high historical standard (chart 3 4). for uk whole, relative path incorporate february projections, appear upside risk near-term. a well straightforward momentum, would seem message rise past month ratio number house sell estate agent stock unsold house book - one measure ‘tightness’ market. this reasonable contemporaneous, even slightly leading, indicator past (chart 5). the significance policy that, take together fairly buoyant business surveys, suggest near-term outlook domestic demand may slightly strong look couple month ago. we need consider reach policy judgment, alongside developments, include risk international environment. but, addition, separately suggest argument place alongside favour ‘caution’. namely, could argue policy may need tight would otherwise case order arrest somewhat continue strength household sector. the argument would try reduce risk abrupt correction, would complicate monetary policy make achievement inflation target uncertain ahead. this argument weigh alongside analysis point towards ‘caution’. i would not, however, subscribe make surprise policy tighten form shock therapy. one emphasis mpc’s approach utmost help households, business financial market understand strategy and, particular, react development economy. from perspective, backdrop committee’s debate vote recent meet begin march. a tighten would come surprise. my view sufficient evidence construct compel explanation rise term outlook inflation. and so, i concern earlier-than-expected policy change might well misunderstand imply my, broadly committee’s, policy reaction function change reason. with inflation expectation well anchored, risk worth taking. so i vote change. look ahead, i take one month time, assess domestic international data, revise view outlook necessary. financial stability environment a word financial stability. the past year also bring calm condition financial markets. sign potential fragility perhaps evident around october 2002. credit default swap price number world’s large bank register sharp rise loss corporate loan portfolios, volatile trade revenue coincide uncertain macro outlook, unwind equity bubble, continue worry emerge market economies, fallout enron worldcom. on whole, environment look somewhat comfortable. in equity markets, realise forward-looking volatility down, ipo market seem spring back life. most measure credit risk - spreads, credit default swap premia, default rates, rat downgrades-to-upgrades - improve (chart 6). at bank dealers, profit use bolster replenish capital; credit default spread low virtually bank (chart 7). 4 bi review 17/2004 but environment without hazards. one may source ‘search yield’ feature international market past [18] month - evidenced, example, record inflow hedge fund emerge market high-yield bond mutual fund u (chart 8). just eighteen month ago commentator ask whether credit spread may overshoot upside, past month wonder whether might overshoot downside - although perhaps degree correction since january. separately, global pattern current account deficit surplus create risk financial markets, obviously foreign exchange market - although, i take note occasions, one wouldn’t guess seem quite low imply volatility currency pairs. perhaps significantly, risk volatility fixed-income market give inevitable uncertainty path fomc take back towards neutral rate. there sign uncertainty option market (chart 9). those imply volatility might exaggerate bid option manage negative convexity u mortgage-backed security portfolios. but, term risk volatile markets, convexity hedge create strains, event july-august last year underline rather graphically. i mention u mb market i guess interest give demand long-duration fixed-income asset match long-dated fixed-income-like liability etc. so good see that, review uk mortgage market, david mile flag importance think prepayment risk uk fixed-income mortgage could managed. since prepayment u seem ‘behavioural’ element, easy get exact hedge via ‘matching’ financial option. it also good see david advocate fannie-freddie type structure uk, attendant concentration moral hazard risk - conceivable source systemic issue global markets. intelligence fixed-income market uk long-term save industry this take back, briefly, bank’s market intelligence work, i want conclude mention issue would like explore go forward. in particular, interest understand implication asset price market dynamic increase emphasis joined-up asset liability management, include give fund manager benchmark base actual liability rather standard market indices. some implication arise demand long-duration asset match long-term liabilities; move towards hedge directly optionality present liabilities, guarantee nominal return annuities; search return wide class assets. concretely, big issue - probably remain - balance equity bond asset portfolios. but also question whether industry material participant newish inflation-swaps market order hedge long-dated real defined-benefit pension liabilities; whether swaptions equity derivative use manage risks, whether near ‘in-the-money’ option well ‘out money’ options; demand long-dated gild strip greater, especially many industry call strips; extent uk pension fund investment hedge funds, whether pursue principally via fund funds; degree involvement ‘alternative asset classes’, private equity emerge markets; speculatively, whether ‘missing markets’ would useful long-term save industry - example, longevity-risk securitisations; and, prosaically, whether great interest mundane way enhance return asset portfolios, security lending. finally, connection, i hope recent multi-agency report security lend prove helpful pension fund trustee others. a know, colleague david rule, chair stock lend repo committee, help facilitate exercise. but write industry industry, welcome napf. it exercise bank learn

leave choice topic today’s lecture, decide me. i choose topic i consider one would perhaps interest bright young student one contemporary relevance. although role central bank extensively discuss literature monetary economics, role central banker remain obscure central banker traditionally mean operate anonymity therefore public accountability unclear. governor dr. y.v. reddy highlight neglect central banker adduce common perspective ‘the central banker neither fish fowl; neither academician banker’. a serious research central banker neglect bring fore several useful insight role central banker general emerge country particular. first, principal reason lack focus role central banker common perception central banker involve discharge certain specialise arcane functions. such perspective derive justification extreme generalization central bank functions, common set instrument use monetary control achieve common set objective price stability sustain economic growth. such generalise perspective, however, lack serious appeal. should say central banker develop country different develop emerge country? in particular, compare central banker unite states, unite kingdom central banker small underdevelop economy. second, central bank consider monopoly institution area activities. there common perception competitive environment organisation manager evaluate term distinctive core competencies. even though central bank monopoly institutions, theoretical empirical study document differential effectiveness public policy, even though set instrument use across countries. evidence show economic policy may effective country le effective others. in context central banks, style monetary management differ significantly across country due difference socio-economic-technological-institutional environment. a third viewpoint central banker perform macro-level function thus, feel micro-level operations. this viewpoint erroneous. central bank sometimes engage micro-level functions. central bank function modern day central bank extend far beyond domain traditional function currency management, banker government promote financial soundness. these re-orientations natural corollary pursue monetary policy measure focus definitive, well-defined quantifiable objectives. central bank emerge economy differ counterpart develop country several ways. in develop countries, central bank vest conduct monetary policy. in emerge countries, central banks, besides monetary policy, also shoulder responsibility debt management, regulation/supervision bank financial institutions. even regard conduct monetary policy, central bank emerge economy contend several objectives, distinct trade-off compare develop country pursue single objective price stability. while pursue multiple objectives, manage complex trade-offs, central bank emerge country assume responsibility look interest several agent include depositors, intermediaries, government, business, external trade. in regard choice instruments, give level market development, multiple objectives, emerge country cannot entirely rely single instrument interest rates. rather, central bank bi review 17/2004 1 emerge country prefer judicious mix interest rates, cash reserves, instruments. the strike feature central bank emerge country pertain critical role development financial market active involvement institution build process. institution build in indian context, rbi, consultation government, play major role institution build since independence. effort direction encompass rbi’s contribution development commercial banking, development finance institution area agriculture industry, specialise institution development financial markets. after initiation economic reform early 1990s, role rbi area develop financial market particularly government securities, money market payment settlement systems, come fore. moreover, global environment, increase integration international economy, rbi’s role regulator supervisor commercial bank financial institution assume central place promote transparency credibility institution monetary financial policies. monetary policy most central banker presently enjoy independence choose policy instrument use rely set short-term interest rates. a logical offshoot, many central bank emerge market give exposure pursue price stability one main objective monetary policy. in rbi, financial market committee (fmc), meet daily open market time frequently, situation warrants. the fmc review liquidity interest rate situation financial market advise top management course action would require rbi day. this institutionalise framework help rbi take integrate view all-important decision impact financial markets. economist long debate objective(s) monetary policy. in develop countries, monetary stability, define price stability, constitute dominant objective monetary policy. in emerge economies, central bank contend several concerns; price stability, sustain growth, financial system’s stability, stable exchange rate, operate objective liquidity management. the animate discussion central bank objective range broadly single objective multiple objectives. such discussion entail generic analysis advantage disadvantage single multiple objectives, nature, scope central bank organisation, differ across country group develop emerge country due significant difference socio-economic-technological-institutional environment. adoption single objective monetary policy central bank base argument (i) monetary policy concentrate instrument one objective, free policy trade-off, thereby strengthen implementation monetary policy; (ii) single objective promote transparency, accountability independence monetary policy; (iii) single objective realistic deregulate globalise economic financial system; (iv) easy observe channel transmission, therefore, easy determine ‘right’ instruments. since central bank’s monetary policy action could involve several implication economy whole, counter-arguments single objective derive fact (i) economic objective achieve simultaneously (in harmony), single objective may disrupt harmony; (ii) monetary policy may able bring inflation wing policy deployed. the case multiple objective central bank entail “co-ordination” range policy thus, spectrum objectives. the principal reason central bank emerge economy contend multiple objectives, least dual objective price stability economic growth derive concern socio-economic-political systems. jam tobin, nobel laureate economist, argue since central bank form integral part government, cannot dissociate major objective society, include sustain economic growth price stability. william poole, revere central banker view economic growth citizens’ objective central banker citizens. 2 bi review 17/2004 currency management one important traditional function central bank countries. central bank serve service provider issue distribute currency note coins. in develop countries, high degree homogeneity society reflect culture, language, taste preference public efficient distribution income could induce homogenous pattern currency demand thus, facilitate achieve good currency management compare develop countries. in develop countries, significant diversity socio-economic development across region induce completely different currency preference public across regions, across demographic segments, thus, entail dynamic complex currency management task central bankers. what noteworthy way technology harness bring improvement currency management. the rbi perform role currency management objective ensure adequate availability coin note maintain quality note circulation. this do 18 regional issue offices/sub office wide network currency chests, repository small coin depot spread across country. in pursuance clean note policy, effort make improve quality note circulation. in emerge market include india, central bank manage government debts. quite apart need decide issue kind auctioning, type security auction maturity profile securities, remain issue extent support central bank commercial bank extend government borrow programme. this important point view deepen government security markets, also term flow cost credit commercial sector. a adviser government, central banker need interact intimately government fiscal policy matter provide unify coherent signal market macro policy stance. in recent years, central bank become pro-active area structural reforms. the indian case provide excellent testimony towards point. the strategy financial reforms, work close coordination government, undertake appropriate sequential step synchronise real sector reforms. this relevant indian scenario government significant stake bank system consequently, disruption financial structure could significant budgetary implications. the rbi undertake wide-ranging reform deepen widen financial market - money market, government security market foreign exchange market. these market become vibrant competitive. central bankers, present era, rely combination policy measure day-to-day operations. they undertake combination action primarily provide signal policy stance market participants. reform tool monetary policy therefore gain prominence. such reform make possible grow emphasis indirect instrument monetary control de-emphasis direct instrument policy. open market operations, milieu, grow importance. interest rate flexibility another tool. a major instrument statutory pre-emption, cash reserve ratio progressively de-emphasize instead, short-term instruments, repo rate medium-term, instrument bank rate become important. likewise, several instances, statutory liquidity ratio (slr), erstwhile important prudential measure, increasingly scale down. the idea inherent transformation approach monetary policy provide bank maximum freedom portfolio choice, without lose sight risk asset accretion, provide opportunity ensure resource allocation optimal. give concern emerge economy, certain portion bank resource often prescribe allot ‘priority sector norms’; case well, range activity cover priority sector expand provide great choice banks. and let u forget central bank’s authority power “moral suasion” act supervisory regulatory force, even explicit oversight financial system place. liquidity determination key efficiency action monetary authorities. a economy increasingly open up, interaction domestic external market expect impinge liquidity much growth impulse within economy. liquidity however static, view speed transaction settlement sharp increase financial innovations. since liquidity function domestic monetary policy much external sector policy debt management strategy, modern day central banker confront enviable task balance tightrope walk ensure economy remain track. a banker banks, central banker tend exercise considerable discretion rarely go straightjacket rule-based methods. while ‘lender-of-the-last’ resort function central bank bi review 17/2004 3 continue important, addition, central bank provide access refinance facility whole host services, matter payment settlement, fund transfer, settle government security nd like. another area central banker emerge country assume new responsibility pertain manage economy response external development context globalisation. deputy governor dr. rakesh mohan rightly point globalisation offer several benefit well host challenges. in increasingly global environment, country adapt great internationalisation economic policies. in regard, central banker emerge country alert international development acquire skill area international banking, international finance economics, international regulation international relation order function effectively manage monetary financial condition economy. in area bank soundness, central bank emerge market become major initiator activity. financial supervision, whether on-site off-site, assume prominence face market imperfection ensure depositor protection. it widely recognise asian crisis large extent, outcome lax supervisory standard pursue crisis-ridden economies. the soundness bank non-bank entity depend operation entities, also efficacy supervisory process. in context, core principles, enunciate bi 1997, quickly become benchmark rbi now, compliant principles. in view grow risk bank entail scarcity supervisory resources, many central bank increasingly move towards risk-based approach supervision order ensure optimum utilisation supervisory resources. follow recent advancements, central bank develop macro-prudential indicator order monitor health financial entity within overall economic environment operate. high quality regulation supervision, contribute directly improvement operate efficiency, beneficial emerge country since efficiency allocation resource productive sector cannot achieve sustain without achieve operate efficiency. regulation supervision institution is, however, simple task especially indian context involve large network bank financial institution large number branch spread entire country. bank branch involve wide network inter-action different market segment owe diversify portfolio deregulate environment. in context, central banker highly skilled, vibrant dynamic order effective regulation supervision. in several countries, central bank assume pivotal place payment settlement system. a financial transaction become increasingly complex, arise need harness financial market fully exploit advance information technology communication networking. some important research study show relatively large involvement central bank financial system contribute financial development. for emerge countries, central bank involvement payment system enhance financial development. there consider view efficient payment settlement system contribute operate allocation efficiency financial system thus, overall economic growth. payment settlement system emerge country involve several features, distinct develop countries. one guide principle follow rbi reform payment settlement system need provide safe, secure efficient systems. rbi identify systemically important financial intermediary (sifi), propensity systemic risks. the introduction screen base trade government security follow delivery versus payment model form negotiate deal system (nds) milestone regard. the commencement foreign exchange clear clear corporation india ltd. aim net

relate fund transfer real time mode. go beyond technological upgradation, issue also remain formulate appropriate legal framework, transaction could take place safe, sound secure manner. the growth e-transactions ‘digital signatures’ case point. a would aware, challenge central banker present day manifold i venture list discern audience. first challenge financial sector liberalisation. while competitive financial market doubt aid efficient allocation resources, failure even disruption one segment financial sector serious ‘contagion effects’ 4 bi review 17/2004 throughout rest economy. thus central banker need vigilant alert domestic external developments. there also remain challenge ensure soundness financial institutions. the supervision financial system get increasingly complicate growth ‘one-stop-banking’ conglomerate well off-shore financial activity operate multiple segment financial markets, lead blur distinction among various segment themselves. repeat financial crisis across world provide graphic evidence fact financial disruption engender serious output costs. in context, need effective supervision hardly underscored. in conclusion, central bank pass challenge yet excite times. while development within country charter transformation, experience country provide invaluable lesson approach promote growth, whilst maintain price stability. all all, life central banker one anonymity, staid boring. it moment go tough central banker emerge isolation lean wind battle splenetic insurmountable odds. central banker choose profession drive commitment public service, hold dear irrespective financial remuneration. the conduct central bank inherently involve ultimate good society. an inappropriate choice instrument target lead large loss macro-economic well being. ultimately, citizen stake holder central bank. former governor, dr. bimal jalan rightly refer central bank public’s institutions. every central banker conscious operate apex financial system centre macro-economic management, continuously balance risk every policy action. in sense, central banker posse certain unique quality - integrity professionalism high order, finely hone analytical skills, capability take decision difficult circumstances, thorough knowledge manner economy functions, adaptability dynamism respond life continuous change challenge. what avoid partisanship command public support. together, attribute distinguish central banker leader manager people, situation money, always dedicate service nation. no wonder central banker call priest temple

food production shortfall, pullout anglo-american bi review 17/2004 1 corporation konkola copper mines, fiscal difficulty arise from, amongst things, high program wages, recurrent departmental charge (rdcs) payment ex-ramcoz workers, high lend interest rate delay reach agreement new prgf arrangement consequent failure reach highly indebted poor country (hipc) initiative completion point, several positive encourage development record year, particularly second half year. lady gentlemen, positive development that, fifth consecutive year national output increased, real gross domestic product (gdp) grow 4.3 percent, high 3.3 percent growth register 2002. with population growth rate 3 percent, mean positive per caput growth show improvement towards poverty reduction. the growth real gdp mainly attribute favourable development domestic global economy. in domestic economy, recovery agriculture effect drought 2001/2002-season couple government’s support area input supply small viable farmer fertiliser support programme (fsp) major factor record positive growth. in addition, recovery world economy push price non-fuel commodity assist growth non-traditional metal export lead expansion growth mine quarry sector. the key sector contribute observe growth tourism, manufacturing, construction energy. in addition, annual overall inflation decline 17.2 percent december 2003 26.7

lady gentlemen, another notable development 2003 decline commercial banks’ lend rates. this reflect weight average lend base rate, fell 37.7 percent december 2003 42.4 percent month 2002. i glad

commercial banks. it expectation that, time, commercial banks’ lend productive sector, especially agriculture increase. the bank closely monitor development credit productive sector. i must stress low lend rate end itself. we bank would like see development accompany observable increase loan extend growth sector economy thrive, stimulate national output create employment. it effort reduce current

economic reform sound institution speech dr jürgen stark, vice president deutsche bundesbank, central bank argentine republic, buenos aires, 9 march 2004. * * * the last time i visit argentina five year ago start economic recession. since then, argentina undergo painful experience socially, politically, economically financially. over past years, i follow development argentina great attentiveness well great concern destruction many economic livelihood unused opportunity country. i come buenos aire today friend argentina. i would like form impression current situation outlook. i shall listen well give assessment current problems. and i shall perspective major imf shareholder. key role policy argentina’ history past 150 year characterise break economic financial development. period economic prosperity political stability often follow deep crisis, rapid decline currency great poverty. economic monetary policy invariably major - crucial - significance this. more 100 year ago, bankers’ magazine encapsulate role politics argentina state “everything argentina’s national life, whether industrial, commercial financial, begin end politics.”1that statement confirm economic development past two decades. for one thing, mistake economic policy decision - especially government debt get hand - mid late 1980s lead directly hyperinflation replacement currency. after “lost decade”, convertibility law comprehensive reform early 1990s succeed stabilise economy currency. in first half 1990s, argentina manage match economic success enjoy begin twentieth century. the necessary basic condition initially successful development – firm political resolve, – confidence country’s strength mobilisation inherent potential, – technical financial assistance self-help international institutions. i firmly believe argentina return stability prosperity last sound basis. manipulation arbitrary intervention market bring, best, short-term illusory success. i think important remember basic condition i cited. what required, particular, unconditional political undertake comprehensive sensible economic reforms. economic recovery argentina it gratify that, past year, argentinian economy recover four year recession. real gdp growth increase good 8%. the inflation rate low clearly year. unemployment poverty slowly reduced. for current year, too, outlook promising. the imf anticipate growth 4%. argentina benefit improve global economic outlook sharp depreciation peso. the future pace growth hinge crucially policy measure take strengthen investment boost corporate consumer confidence. 1 bankers’ magazine (1899), quote a g ford, the gold standard 1880-1914. britain argentina, oxford 1962. bi review 15/2004 1 the political agenda extensive. it call highly credible political leadership order press ahead reform need create confidence part investors, consumer well as, particular, international financial markets. that special priority assign objective regain access international financial market soon possible. argentina rely able cover finance need via international financial institution long-term basis. in connection, call mind yet argentina debt imf, example, uninterrupted period two decade accompany sometimes considerable rate increase. argentina compete fund emerge economy international financial markets. to utilise potential, create economic growth jobs, and, especially, combat poverty, argentina need confidence international investors. in order achieve that, good creditor-debtor relation needed. at end 1990s, argentina gain lot recognition exemplary relation creditors. it important re-establish relations. the treatment investor past two year destroy much stock confidence - argentina. at point, worth note - contrast flow capital south east asia - total inflow private capital latin america go half last year compare level end 2001 accord late estimate washington institute international finance. there reason this, take seriously. in argentina, two problem area need rapid constructive solution. 1. reform bank sector: recapitalisation bank urgently required; compensation asymmetrical indexation pesofication bring conclusion still open question offset loss arise ‘amparos’ bring settlement soon possible. the tax financial transaction conducive strengthen bank system either. 2. restructure argentina’s debt. international investor naturally also continue deter argentina’s still unresolved debt problem. since argentinian government unilaterally cease make payment foreign private creditor two year ago, hardly progress make towards reschedule debt apart name bank consortium. the offer present september 2003 evidently unacceptable private creditors. without wish interfere process, i believe would argentina’s interest enter quickly meaningful negotiation private creditor representative will hold talks. this do basis ambitious time schedule. the aim find solution sustainable long term fair sides. this must place great strain argentina’s economic financial capacities. nor must excessive demand place creditors’ willingness waive claims. those key precondition regain access international capital markets. i repeat: rapid success reschedule argentina’s interest something disregarded. what consider context significantly high primary surplus require this. the budget approve congress current year provide basis raise primary surplus. international community during past years, international community give extensive assistance argentina abandon fate. argentina remain important member international community states. argentina’s membership g-20, establish 1999, underline standing. every country enjoy advantage member international community. membership also entail obligations, must infringed, let alone destroyed. they fulfil circumstances. argentina’s debt international financial institution end 2003 amount around us$31 billion. in line share capital ifis, member state european union bear us$10 billion compare around us$5 billion usa. even though imf multilateral development bank pay financial aid imposition conditions, 2 bi review 15/2004 argentina’s sovereignty uphold cases. however, arise responsibility use fund intend purposes. conversely, international financial institution shareholder responsible fund allocate accordance conditionality relevant statute ifis. the imf, example, may grant financial aid avert temporary balance payment crisis subject conditions. the revolve nature imf’s resource fundamentally prohibit prolong use. the international financial institutions, imf world bank, shareholder lot patience argentina recently. the discussion imf executive board end january g-7 statement boca raton show shareholder want see results. it expect argentina work constructively imf. a case every imf member program country, bind commitment verifiable implementation precondition imf loans. after all, high degree imf involvement argentina lead emergence doubt quarter prefer creditor status imf world bank. that status, hitherto observe without qualification, must call question account possible far-reaching implication might fund’s role overcome disruption balance payments. economic reform the political mood latin america recently turn market-economy-oriented policy cases. many people latin america associate reform weak growth, low income unemployment. the term “reform” justice word implies, however, use measure that, look objectively, hardly describe real reforms. it therefore come surprise positive result fail materialise people talk “reform fatigue”. the current issue magazine latin finance take in-depth look subject reform fatigue resurgence populism.2 it describe populism “latin america’s chronic political disease” state “voters may attract populism, cannot deliver long-term growth repel private capital investment.” that certainly new insight mean apply solely south america, rather general validity. follow debt crisis early 1980s, comprehensive process reform begin latin america. macroeconomic policy concentrate problem stabilisation, structural reform promote growth. in 1995 mexico, float peso basis provide economic financial reform set train process growth slow debt dynamics. something similar repeat argentina start 1990s. finally, well year ago, brazil able regain investors’ confidence comprehensive reform programme. of course, - like industrial country - key debate take place far, quickly time structural reform implemented. from european perspective, two point make base general experience. 1. structural reform make economy flexible therefore le susceptible shocks. this flexibility avoidance excessive government intervention enhance efficiency economy. if reform implement credible manner, confidence investor consumer strengthened. such strengthen confidence compensate potential short-term negative effect economy. furthermore, question macroeconomic cost failure act would be. 2. experience europe also confirm structural reform combine properly structure fiscal consolidation bring positive economic result even short term. 2 latin finance, february 2004. bi review 15/2004 3 washington consensus example latin america show turnaround good possible. what key success? in 1989, john williamson, senior fellow institute international economics, draw kind basic canon recommendable reform policy latin america coin term “washington consensus” this.3 specifically, involve follow policies: (1) macroeconomic stability indispensable prerequisite economic growth, (2) redistribution public expenditure favour healthcare, education infrastructure, (3) tax reform goal broad assessment base low marginal tax rates, (4) liberalisation financial sector include interest rates, (5) creation competitive exchange rate, (6) liberalisation trade, (7) dismantle restriction foreign direct investment, (8) privatisation state-owned enterprises, (9) deregulation make economy competitive, (10) safeguard right ownership. the washington consensus misinterpret - often unwittingly sometimes quite intentionally. for many, synonymous “cold neoliberalism” “market fundamentalism”. such interpretation obviously variance reform i listed. slogan “minimal state” “free, unfettered movement capital” nowhere find among ten points. after all, nothing promote particular ideology simply matter apply economic law market framework. a misinterpretation concern reform programme’s relationship international institution headquarter washington. there people claim power institution trigger reform argentina. such interpretation obviously overestimate impact programme, however. incidentally, reform low common denominator prevail washington early 1990s. a i see it, reform police recommend washington consensus retain full validity even today argentina latin america general. that also go exchange rate policy. the 1991 decision peg peso u dollar currency board right argentina time. after year hyperinflation, currency board important successful element argentina’s stabilisation strategy. over years, however, strict peg u dollar handicap country’s international competitiveness - introduction flexible arrangement early stage would therefore better. even support currency board admit float peso end 1990s would beneficial argentina. by way, bundesbank always point matter principle that, currency board regime introduced, charge responsibility policy always exit strategy well. i wish stress element washington consensus still valid today. how element implement - words, sequence pace - depend particular circumstance country concerned. reform consensus “plus” have say that, would seem appropriate give think augment consensus, “consensus plus”. for me, concern two point particular: 1. importance sound institutions, 2. social dimension economic developments. recently, debate economic reform undergo shift emphasis. without doubt, stability-oriented macropolicy still key. alongside continue unquestioned importance issue privatisation combine market liberalisation, deregulation general limitation government activity, public institutional condition appropriate function market come sharply focus late. essentially, concern role institution play country’s economic development. sound institution play part reduce country’s susceptibility external internal negative shocks. 3 john williamson, “from reform agenda damage brand name”, finance & development, september 2003, p 10. 4 bi review 15/2004 more anything else, crisis emerge market past ten year clearly reveal grave implication non-existent unsound institution have. institution anchor sovereign action reliable framework improve consistency continuity political measures. strong institution need good policy become effective. that also apply central bank independent political influence. if, say, domestic financial market emerge economy inadequately developed, country often tend towards unsound debt structure borrow excessively short term foreign currency. moreover, emerge market liberalise financial sector relatively quickly without parallel adequate strengthen banks’ risk management oversight supervisory institutions. since last year, important industrial emerge country represent g-20 take in-depth look importance sound institutions. there general consensus susceptibility crisis reduce country establish efficient domestic capital market create independent supervisory institution oversee financial intermediary markets. broad, deep liquid domestic financial market alleviate tension access international financial market deteriorate time. what also crucial development modern efficient payment system central bank actively involved. various study show direct involvement central bank payment system operation advantageous, all, emerge markets. above beyond that, legal system integral component give country’s institutional framework major importance satisfactory function financial system. that imply credible statutory framework monetary fiscal policies, include independence central bank, rule competition regulation corporate governance. a sound legal system guarantee freedom fulfilment contract enforcement private right ownership. of importance appropriate unambiguous rule regulation rigorously enforce court law. the second point concern social dimension sense create social security system and, amongst things, promote education training. this social dimension, however, could also understand sense social market economy base german model successfully apply ludwig erhard half century ago. social market economy the concept social market economy base economic freedom safeguard rule law. this supplement arrangement pertain social security equitable distribution. accord concept, economic activity matter private sector, government’s policy set framework economic activity unfold (or ordnungspolitik know germany). the social market economy require encourage competition entrepreneurship, sense personal responsibility readiness take risks. the “social” element market economy concept mean market freedom restrict social grind area produce socially undesirable outcomes. furthermore, result economic process correct place appear social enough light society’s values. a properly understand social policy envisage subsidiary role state. the duty state confine provide financial insurance existential risks, illness old age, promote education training. unfortunately, germany move away principle social market economy past 30 years. we overextend welfare state and, so, overstrain capacity economy. for reason, in-depth discussion revert principle social market economy get way. give country’s generous social safety net, social policy germany mean transfer payment restrict group person really need. for latin america, weight basic social problem mean priority likely apply. for europe latin america, however, remain equally important emphasis social aspect market economy result efficiency economy impaired. bi review 15/2004 5 the difficulty push reform something germany well aware. we emerge three-year period stagnation potential growth declined. every effort therefore make raise potential growth sustain high level again. a number reform initiated. nevertheless, adopt reform first step. we germany need all-embracing modernisation society, government economy. conclusion the governor mexican central bank, guillermo ortiz, recently make call latin america’s reform fatigue overcome.4 i concur objective would like stress, particular, great effort term create sound institution could play major part achieve it. that apply emerge market latin america also many industrial countries. argentina number difficult year behind it. at time, people argentina good future look forward mobilise ability strengths. argentina country great potential. what need strengthen self-belief use economic potential available. 4 guillermo ortiz, overcome reform fatigue, finance & development, september 2003. 6 bi review 15/2004 joseph yam: two ifc talk mr joseph yam, chief executive hong kong monetary authority, federation hong kong industry annual dinner 2004, hong kong, 2 march 2004. * * * i delight join annual dinner evening. since foundation 1960, federation hong kong industry see enormous change business landscape hong kong. in 1960 hong kong reach end first decade major centre manufacturing. today hong kong centre much large regional manufacture base, 5 million manufacture worker employ hong kong company guangdong province alone. the size diversity manufacture base make work organisation even important challenging. the federation rise challenge grow focus pearl river delta beyond stress communication co-operation counterpart beyond hong kong, mainland china, asia across world. a industrialists, command considerable resources, producer wealth investor main user hong kong’s financial infrastructure. my aim speech tell something recent future development infrastructure. but first i point “two ifc” - title speech - stand magnificent new build hkma office housed. it stand mach two international financial centre. it stand new vision international financial centre like. it raise question hong kong special administrative region government (hksarg) go discharge responsibility article 109 basic law “the maintenance status hong kong international financial centre”. you may wonder i refer mach two description international financial centre. mach define new oxford dictionary english “the ratio speed body speed sound surround medium”. mach two generally use mean twice speed sound. it also use image high dimension. i think suitable description phenomenal, dimensional jump see global finance - environment international financial centre function. financial liberalisation, consequently globalisation financial markets, place new demand international financial centre. the information technology revolution mean speed international capital travel globe, volume, increase tremendously, extent traditional topography key attribute constitute international financial centre long adequate. the migration financial sector activity cyber space begun, whether like not. when last time go bank? you conduct bank transaction internet, enjoy vacation phuket family reunion whistler. soon financial intermediaries, may even market themselves, start migrate cyber space. indeed, boundary arise geography time zone break many activities, particularly financial markets, influence globalisation revolution information technology. what attribute mach two international financial centre? and hksarg discharge responsibility specify clearly article 109 basic law? these challenge question legal responsibility onerous one. but i attempt answer questions, i think i should, view increase emphasis hong kong accountability, first draw attention function responsibility task rest. you may aware this, chief executive hksarg, 27 june last year, issue public statement concern responsibility financial secretary (fs) secretary financial service treasury (sfst). specifically relation status hong kong international financial centre, statement specify that: “fs shall responsible determine policy objective macro level. sfst shall responsible formulate specific policy achieve objective oversee implementation regulatory authority organisation appropriate”. bi review 15/2004 1 on day, financial secretary make public statement concern macro policy objective relation to, among things, maintenance status hong kong international financial centre. he say that: “an international financial centre place financial institution many different jurisdiction come together carry financial intermediation international dimension. the government seek maintain enhance hong kong’s status major international financial centre. towards end, government - a. maintain appropriate economic legal environment open, fair efficient market, include ensure hong kong’s law continue provide level play field; b. enhance international competitiveness hong kong’s financial service promote international financial intermediation attract foreign save hong kong; c. develop payment, clear settlement system facilitate safe efficient conduct international cross-border financial service hong kong; d. strengthen corporate governance standard view foster international confidence financial markets.” i think macro policy objective maintenance status hong kong international financial centre appropriate. indeed, seem appropriate difference opinion express publicly since promulgation june last year. it may reflection general lack interest subject. i hope not. the hong kong monetary authority one regulatory authority responsible implement specific policy maintain hong kong’s status international financial centre. you may hear exchange letter financial secretary monetary authority, also june last year, set division function responsibility monetary financial affair two. in principal letter, financial secretary specify that, support policy maintain status hong kong international financial centre: “the monetary authority, discharge responsibility maintain stability integrity monetary financial system hong kong, shall, co-operation relevant authority organisations, seek promote: a. development payment, clear settlement system facilitate safe efficient conduct international cross-border financial activity hong kong; b. confidence hong kong’s monetary financial system active participation international financial central bank forums; c. appropriate market development initiative help strengthen international competitiveness hong kong’s financial services.” against somewhat bureaucratic politically essential background, let give views, worth, mach two international financial centre. a explain statement financial secretary last june, international financial centre place carry financial intermediation international dimension. this means, i think, channel foreign save hong kong investment hong kong save foreign investments. that would narrow interpretation. in case, hong kong economy small international standard. save investments, national account terms, amount merely hk$400 billion year, hardly month’s turnover stock exchange. financial intermediation international dimension is, i think, mean include also channel save one foreign jurisdiction investment another foreign jurisdiction, example, u save investment mainland china, vice versa, german save indonesian investments, on. to aspire international financial centre, must provide platform whereby international financial intermediation conduct hong kong, substantial volume activity capture here. the question is: “how?” 2 bi review 15/2004 we not, course, forget traditional mach one answers. i sure familiar all. they include: a. respect rule law independence judiciary; b. pool skilled labour; c. robust regulatory system light regulatory touch; d. simple personal corporate tax regime low tax rate; e. government responsive financial sector concerns; f. stable freely convertible currency; g. clean efficient government; h. attractive work live environment. all mach one attribute continue important. they lie foundation international financial centre, must best ensure continuity, strengthen light change circumstances. but, i say earlier, dimensional jump global finance arise globalisation financial market revolution information technology make inadequate own. on business side, talk about, example, provident fund manager foreign jurisdiction access minute information financial markets. they nimble make portfolio reallocation among bank deposits, debt equity, hop across three different channel financial intermediation look financial arrangement instrument best suit investment appetite. we also talk increase number high net worth international citizen carry portable computers, quite capable manage finance demand direct access financial markets. on risk management side, talk investor increasingly alert risk skilful manage them. apart minority play currency markets, majority probably wish, example, incur exchange rate risk second currency top currency economy invest savings. we also talk increase number sophisticate market participant aware payment, clear settlement risk financial transactions. receive cheque necessarily mean finality payment. strike deal bond purchase necessarily mean immediate title bonds. you necessarily get u dollar euros, buy asian time zone asian currencies, time part money. many probably still care. but increasingly realise happen money hour time difference age information technology. i hope wake-up call take form major it scandal international finance. but let offer little comfort tell mach two international financial centre i mind go long way towards meet business risk management need i refer to. in fact, quietly effectively put together build blocks, plumb wire cater need enable hong kong attain mach two status. i think way ahead others effort, quite lot still need done. and need time, effort, support understand community, particularly financial community, part may vest interest maintenance status quo. what additional attribute qualify mach one international financial centre mach two? there are, far i identify, four attributes. the first attribute obvious one existence financial intermediation channel characterise stability, integrity, diversity efficiency. i believe financial intermediation channel banking, equity debt, derivatives, already enjoy characteristics. for many year series bank crisis eighties, bank system serve reliable conduit absorb domestic well international savings, channel borrow funds. great competition, particularly interest rate liberalisation, increase efficiency benefit borrowers. the many mortgager hong kong, example, enjoy mortgage interest rate, relative prime, four percentage point le six year ago. and great depositor protection way plan introduction deposit insurance. the share commercial well consumer credit information also help bi review 15/2004 3 good credit stand ready access funds, favourable interest rates. a bank supervisor attach great importance promote “the general stability effective work bank system” - requirement clearly state preamble bank ordinance. we take responsibility seriously able work bank ensure confidence traditional essential financial intermediation channel remain high, even unfavourable circumstances, past years. similar progress make regulation equity market security future commission. long go day equity market run by, primarily for, financial intermediary rather channel financial intermediation. long go day market close day important financial intermediation channel brutally disrupt financial intermediary get difficulties. there great realisation role stock exchange secondary market provide bedrock primary ipo market, channel save investment promote economic growth development. there much great appreciation public interest importance override private interest financial intermediaries. improvement see market past decade go way beyond governance market place great market transparency, enable meet best international standards. but diversity financial intermediation channels, hong kong still behind flow fund debt channel remains, relatively speaking, small. this notwithstanding considerable effort since 1990 bring debt issue market, principally form exchange fund paper, outstanding amount hk$120 billion. we also establish reliable benchmark yield curve hong kong dollar debt ten-year maturity assist private sector issuer price build efficient, paperless debt clear system market whole. perhaps long period low sometimes negative real interest rate ninety disincentive debt issue private sector. indeed, significantly positive real interest rate past year low nominal interest rate seem make difference number amount involve debt issue bring market. we need sustain effort development debt market. the diversity financial intermediation channel important attribute international financial centre: also essential maintenance financial stability. diversity reduce dependence particular financial intermediation channel, turn reduce risk systemic problem seriously disrupt normal conduct economic activity event crisis channel. the second attribute make mach two international financial centre existence platform financial transaction conduct major foreign currency well domestic currency. foreign savings, particularly institutionalise management, tend small appetite, any, assumption currency risk seek investment opportunity overseas. hedge currency risks, expose relatively minor currency like hong kong dollar, notwithstanding exchange rate stability demonstrate past twenty years, expensive, extent undermine attraction investment opportunities. currency hedge even difficult investment jurisdiction non-convertible currency. i believe foreign investors’ interest many financial product available hong kong, least allow participation rapid development mainland, may considerably enhance choice currency denomination products. this would also reduce large capital flow currency, get example whenever large ipo, strengthen currency stability. furthermore, new york go bed london wake next day, quite work hour activity market financial instrument denominate u dollar euro traditionally go lull. but financial globalisation increasingly demand 24-hour markets, over-the-counter trade also physical market place form, example, stock exchange. jurisdiction time zone collectively net lender two time zones, much lend take form hold foreign asset denominate two large currencies. about 60% world’s foreign currency reserve hold jurisdiction time zone. some u would obviously welcome, may even demand, facility manage foreign asset time zone, avoid stay late, also avoid unnecessary delay execution investment decisions. event occur time zone move financial market denominate u dollar euro. whether facilitate management currency risk investors, management currency stability, complete 24-hour trade loop global financial instruments, 4 bi review 15/2004 grow need liquid platform time zone conduct financial transaction foreign currencies. however, easy acquire particular attribute mach two international financial centre. the difficulty lie understandable resistance intrusion proprietary right market place individual jurisdictions. the origin of, justification for, financial market invariably domestic nature. while market become global, market structure remain largely domestic. there lot incentive large market go global term cross time zone denominate product also foreign currencies. the hitherto high degree domestic orientation market mean afford attitude, high save rate asia rapid accumulation foreign reserve force change orientation, already take place. last year net purchase u treasury ten asian economy amount us$193.2 billion: almost 60% net increase supply paper. so far, progress form global harmonisation standard “strategic” linkage equity market different jurisdictions, hong kong forefront developments. we remain alert opportunities. the platform conduct financial transaction foreign currency support robust payment, clear settlement systems. this third attribute mach two international financial centre. the revolution information technology speed transmission information tremendously. this also mean much high speed movement international capital much high settlement risk financial transactions. fortunately, information technology also apply prudent management settlement risks. the question whether authority responsible financial infrastructure adequately tune in. when live comfortably home, seldom notice importance proper function plumbing, electricity gas systems, failure occurs. a failure financial infrastructure quite damage integrity confidence financial system, occur international financial centre implication quite serious. in age information technology, payment, clear settlement systems, particularly international financial centre, structure manner minimise risk failure settlement financial transactions. let make four brief point nut bolt systems. first, system design achieve real time gross settlement (rtgs) least large financial transactions, delivery versus payment (dvp) trade financial instrument payment versus payment (pvp) foreign exchange transactions. secondly, already make significant progress build financial infrastructure. we clearly ahead financial centre this, operate rtgs system u dollar, euro course domestic currency hong kong dollar, system link provide pvp. thirdly, intend, next step might guessed, include renminbi infrastructure soon circumstance permit, move cement position international financial centre china. our experience build system put u strong position so. we need lead-time six nine month include additional currency payment infrastructure. fourthly, i urge significant user financial service use system manage settlement risk financial transactions. your banker able help obtain comfort get buy time pay it. the fourth attribute mach two international financial centre availability multidimensional direct access i talk - channel financial intermediation, platform conduct financial transaction payment settlement systems. direct access financial service available wholesale retail levels, financial intermediary principals, include issuer investors, regardless geographical boundaries. there increase demand great convenience direct access, give modern information technology quite capable accommodate demands. the market place finance long require physical location. the need financial intermediary also decreasing. technology also promise fine bid-ask spread trades; low transaction, settlement custodian costs; instant access computerise account hold deposits, debt security stock various currency denominations. even borrower, should, basis establish credit rat credit history available banks, able get onto computer screen competitive offer money. this far-fetched. we almost residential mortgages, except need access multiple bank web-sites rather single one. bi review 15/2004 5 there is, understandably, resistance progress direction. it natural, example, intermediary would resist disintermediation, even though promise great efficiency intermediation fund benefit economy. institutional rigidities, whether arise passage time technological innovation, always difficult resolve satisfaction affect parties, particularly enshrine legislation. so achievement multidimensional access financial service likely take little time achievement three attribute mach two international financial centre. one helpful initiative may develop great appreciation public interest among concerned. but i confident market force assist promote necessary changes, without involvement government supervisory authorities. lady gentlemen, i hope conduct tour two ifc bore you. my aim offer view hong kong develop ifc need maintain edge undoubtedly financial infrastructure. a user infrastructure, probably view perspective own, i would happy discus answer questions. thank you. 6 bi review 15/2004 jean-claude trichet: paris seminar eu accession process (concluding remarks) conclude remark mr jean-claude trichet, president european central

future interaction, particularly enlarge escb. *** listen today’s presentation statements, strike many interlinkages between, one hand, policy issues, other, practical operational aspects. it important, always important, understand implementation issues, anticipate question may arise day-to-day practice. our discussion first session, entitle “monetary exchange rate policy practical function erm ii”, illustrate particularly important case erm ii, practical operational experience erm ii still somewhat limit initial experience “erm i”, although useful, always wholly relevant. our

fiscal rule european union clear case point, discussion second session today entitle “budgetary discipline context stability growth pact” clearly shown. fiscal performance rather weak recently accede countries. in context, multilateral surveillance procedure within eu framework, particular stability growth pact, play key role enhance budgetary discipline. in area, let reiterate govern council ecb share concern european commission regard conclusion ecofin council november last year. the commission guardian treaty ecb respect commission’s decision seek legal clarity. furthermore, see need change

sector. give extent globalisation today’s world, need sound framework conduct business appropriate supervision, also cross-border terms, never pressing. if i draw one general conclusion discussion today, importance prepared. although forthcoming accession undoubtedly major historic achievement, must continue thoroughly prepare integration future order get time policy action right. so go here? look ahead remainder 2004 beyond, clearly challenge need continue prepare. challenge opportunity country represent today. • bulgaria romania course face challenge make progress towards create

2004. * * * good morning. i glad opportunity meet business leader são paulo today. i also please meet counterpart, governor henrique meirelles, colleague banco central brasil. geographically, brazil canada far apart. but economic viewpoint, common might think. we share common issue challenges. we operate monetary policy system base inflation target float exchange rates. we affect recent slowdown world economy global economic imbalances. and work structural adjustment necessary weather shock thrive change environment. today, i want focus remark canada’s adjustment change global economy. i talk effort adjust longer-term economic force challenge force present. some experience may relevant economy make similar adjustment face similar economic circumstances. past adjustment our experience last couple decade teach u structural adjustment key adapt change, and, important, sound macroeconomic policy role play make adjustment minimum economic social disruption. these lesson may seem self-evident. but canadian remind importance significant painful economic adjustment past 30 years. for example, canada hit abrupt slowdown productivity growth 1970s. that slow productivity growth make impossible continue provide gain real wage canadian become accustomed. the situation exacerbate opec oil embargo 1973 subsequent energy crisis hit economy around globe. the consensus day impact event canada would temporary. and canadian policy-makers use macroeconomic microeconomic policy try shield economy impact events. instead make necessary adjustments, try avoid them. a result, eventual adjustment slow painful need be. and end slow growth, relatively high inflation, large government budget deficits. canadian learn period economic policy must focus adjust change - even adjustment cause short-term difficulties. by begin 1990s, clear need framework policy help adjustment, bring inflation, put public finance order. the first major change come 1991, government bank canada agree explicit anchor monetary policy. that anchor series inflation-reduction target would gradually low rate inflation 2 per cent, midpoint 1 3 per cent range. the agreement extend three time currently cover period end 2006. each time, midpoint target range keep 2 per cent. i want note bank government establish monetary policy anchor jointly, bank alone take responsibility conduct monetary policy achieve inflation target. i want stress importance independence. experience around world show distinct advantage monetary policy carry independent central bank, least separate power print money power spend it. central bank independence also mechanism build credibility among investors. central bank choice make anchor monetary policy. some country choose fix exchange rate anchor. in so, central bank give power control domestic inflation. in contrast, country - canada - choose domestic bi review 15/2004 1 inflation anchor. by this, leave foreign exchange market set external value currency. the key point that, since capital mobile, central bank successfully control inflation exchange rate time. the choice inflation-targeting framework serve canada well. since end 1994, inflation average almost exactly 2 per cent. moreover, inflation fallen, become stable 1970s early 1980s. just importantly, inflation expectation fall line 2 per cent target remain there. a float exchange rate, help economy adjust disturbance fluctuation world price products, notably commodities. it also help economy adjust change global save investment flows. one important advantage adopt system inflation-control target bank canada explain clearly business, labour, general public why. we eight regularly schedule interest rate announcement year, plus regular monetary policy report updates. one underestimate benefit arise public understand policy action monetary authority. this understand make easy u conduct monetary policy, allow citizen judge performance central bank. it le five year since brazil adopt inflation-targeting system july 1999, float currency january year. the system already prove extremely helpful reduce inflation rate country, even face large shocks. establish track record credible inflation target lead low inflation expectations. these low expectation create virtuous circle - lead business consumer make price spend decision that, turn, help central bank meet inflation targets. and consistently meet inflation target allow citizen make investment save decision confidence inflation remain close target. the second major adjustment canada make 1990s get fiscal situation control. in early part decade, combine federal provincial primary deficit (which exclude debt-service costs) peak 3 per cent gdp, total deficit close 8 per cent. the combine public debt reach peak 100 per cent gdp. while shortfall reflect cyclical factors, clear situation unsustainable. so 1993 1997, federal provincial government canada make determined, successful, effort eliminate deficit run consistent primary budget surpluses. the fiscal adjustment make level government help improve credibility economic policy reduce risk premium investor demand canadian bonds. while credibility always useful, particularly beneficial period crisis, spread risky investment tend widen. consider canada’s experience mexican currency crisis 1994, credibility monetary fiscal policy fully established. spread canadian bond widen significantly event, consumption investment slowed, lead period weak economic growth. our credibility good establish 1997, able weather financial crisis asia russia slight widen spreads. there minimal uncertainty, growth actually strengthen wake events. when compare two experiences, see real payoff achievement fiscal monetary credibility. and take long payoff realized. canada’s public private sector also make structural adjustment 1990s, lead flexible economy. this add flexibility help u weather recent global economic slowdown. our governments, federal provincial, also take step reduce distortion economy. in latter half 1990s, federal industrial subsidy cut 60 per cent. province eliminate many subsidy programs. the federal government reform unemployment insurance system, canada’s public pension plan overhaul make self-financing decade ahead. this involve restructure benefit increase contribution rates. and contribution invest market order generate best possible return - due consideration prudence - long term. throughout difficult period, government work hard ensure burden adjustment fall disproportionately segment population least able bear it. it 2 bi review 15/2004 adjustment process well underway federal government begin reduce corporate personal income taxes. a government take step improve structure economies, equally important business make adjustments. during 1990s, canadian firm respond challenge free trade improve quality product market aggressively new north american customers. these adjustment easy. but leave canada good position handle economic shock and, therefore, grow sustain basis. to recap, sound monetary policy support float exchange rate, sound fiscal policy, appropriate structural adjustment part help canada’s economy respond change circumstance 1990s. while adjustment difficult, payoff come quickly. by end decade, canadian begin see high real incomes. adjustment future so that’s quick look lesson learn past experience. let’s turn international force work economy talk force mean economic policy future. in global economy today, see significant financial imbalances. the unite state face large fiscal deficit high grow current account deficit, asian country accumulate record current account surpluses. the economy china india, well brazil, become increasingly powerful player world stage. this increase competitive pressure face canadian producers. but also mean new, fast-growing source demand new opportunities. so face forces, kind adjustment needed? i talk situation canada, i say applicable economies. the first thing i would say maintain fiscal balance must remain priority canada year ahead. our federal provincial government make great progress front, canada cannot afford give back hard-won gains. neither government country. maintain fiscal balance important brazil canada. this priority heighten canada longer-term demographic challenges. our ratio public debt gdp need decline give u flexibility meet demand age population. my second point must provide appropriate microeconomic policy area labour markets, intellectual property law, environment, foreign investment. the right microeconomic policy essential order increase productivity raise live standard future. this true every country. however, know implement right economic policy mean group bear unfair share burden adjustment. this mean shy away task. but lead third point, authority must put place right policy facilitate adjustment, provide access training, help worker relocate shift expand area economy. in so, keep mind government help direct towards people, towards specific business industries. so policy-makers provide supportive economic environment business? in view, promote efficient robust financial system, include strong bank sector, critical. and fourth point. this particularly true country canada, small medium-sized business create majority jobs. grow firm must access credit within well-functioning financial system. further, people need confidence bank sector, save efficiently recycle help business expand. a robust financial system also country’s best defence international financial crises. a key lesson asian russian crisis country strong bank sector much le likely affect country bank sector weak. beyond bank sector, country also work develop healthy efficient financial markets. this new idea. canada’s effort build domestic money market go back 50 years. and build market live next door country deepest, liquid bi review 15/2004 3 financial market world - unite states. now, future, need remain focus promote healthy efficient markets. this topic ongoing priority research bank canada. in fact, late year host, along german bundesbank, g-20 workshop build strong domestic financial systems. my fifth final point trade. canada long history support multilateral trade agreements. we seen, first-hand, economy benefit open border trade. that commit try extend benefit free trade whole america free trade area america (ftaa). it also support effort mercosur. and, importantly, commit low trade barrier doha round multilateral negotiations. i see many example challenge government face reduce trade barrier subsidies. we canada difficulty regard but, economist, i know economic benefit free trade make effort worthwhile. so five area priority canada year ahead: fiscal prudence, right microeconomic policies, appropriate social policies, strong stable financial system, open trade. monetary policy, part, continue focus keep inflation low, stable, predictable, thus give citizens, businesses, investor confidence future value money. to achieve this, try keep supply demand balance. since bank canada choose low domestic inflation monetary policy anchor, continue flexible exchange rate. we recognize float currency imply volatility. but i tell canada derive enormous benefit float currency work conjunction solid monetary policy anchor. it give u ability set monetary policy tailor canada’s specific economic circumstances. it send important price signal economic participant help economy make necessary adjustments. conclusion let conclude. for many firm many employees, adjustment painful difficult. but today’s world, adjust option. fortunately, countries, make adjustment relatively favourable conditions. global demand strengthening, credit condition good. we good knowledge need do. and make important progress strengthen economic policy frameworks. the challenge face make even important u continue strengthen framework order adjust change circumstance take advantage potential gains. the fast able adjust, great wealth canada brazil create citizens. that say adjust easy. indeed, experience recent decade prof difficult, least short term. but take leap seize opportunity change bring, society surely benefit. 4 bi review 15/2004 mark w olson: a regulator's view emerge issue community bank speech mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, 118th assembly bank directors, la croabas, puerto rico, 27 february 2004. * * * in 2003 community bank demonstrate value shareholders, deliver solid profitability. community bank - i mean commercial bank asset le $1 billion - earn $12.9 billion 2003, base preliminary call report data. this figure translate return asset 1.18 percent return equity 11.55 percent. fourth-quarter return bite that, follow familiar seasonal pattern. overall, return asset consistently 1.10 percent 1.20 percent return equity close 12 percent. high non-interest income-including mortgage origination service income - decrease require provision allow earn remain strong despite pressure margins. only 6 percent community bank lose money year, represent le 3 percent total assets. consolidation continue industry 2003. accord preliminary figures, 7,300 community bank year-end 2003, 140 few (1.9 percent) year early 500 (or 11 percent) few exist five year ago. the consolidation industry, search efficiency scope, misunderstood. it signal threat community bank franchise; far it. the market community bank charter make point clear. seventy-seven new commercial bank charter issue first nine month 2003, nearly five hundred since begin 2000. over period, every five bank disappear consolidation, another two new charter granted. in total, represent $2.4 billion new equity capital invest community bank charters. community bank net interest margin continue industry whole. for 2003, community bank margin 4.1 percent, nearly thirty-basis point high comparable figure industry. to extent, reflect different business mix, despite role high-spread credit card lend large institutions. a close look call report show community bank seem pay nonmaturity deposit large institutions. the average effective rate pay community bank 2003 1.00 percent, 25 basis point high industry-wide figure 0.74 percent. among factors, trend contribute narrow margin last years. credit quality also improve community banks, support high earnings, although deteriorate significantly industry whole. problem loan barely reach 1.00 percent total loan credit cycle, compare 1.27 percent industry whole. by late 2003, however, community bank problem asset ratio roughly equal large institutions, 0.90 percent. although many similarities, balance sheet development community bank 2003 differ many regard large institutions. community bank hold mortgage-related security largely unchanged end 2002, closed-end mortgage loan hold decline 5 percent, large institution experience significant growth categories. commercial industrial loan fell community bank 2002 2003 much slow rate decline - le half percent year - large institutions. capitalization another area contrast. strong capital ratios, well excess regulatory minimums, key factor manage credit concentration and, indeed, strike attribute profitable community banks. the top one-fifth community banks, term profitability, typically hold 1.6 percentage point capital relative asset community banks. the strike difference, however, see loan commercial real estate. commercial real estate lend - make construction lending; loan secure nonfarm nonresidential properties; multifamily house - continue grow rapidly 2003. the nominal growth loan community bank - $29 billion - essentially account asset growth institutions, amount one-seventh asset growth industry whole. by end 2003, lend reach 25.1 percent aggregate community bank assets. that 7 percent high five year ago, set new record community bank high bi review 14/2004 1 concentration commercial real estate loan - yes, even high early 1990s. this increase appear fairly widespread across population community banks, evident highly profitable less-profitable institutions. commercial real estate lend traditional natural part community bank franchise, account underwrite practice continue much good trouble day 1980s. for reasons, indication time overall credit quality commercial real estate exposure community bank deteriorated. moreover, market report indicate vacancy rate market turn around recovering. that said, number market nationwide experience weakness recent year continue so. many market likely take year recover. bank director management - well supervisor - need closely monitor development area. more generally, critical “franchise” issue community banker recognize manage credit risk concentration also tend natural part community bank business. when credit quality problem emerge institution, course cause low return attract attention friendly bank supervisors. the presence lend concentration indicate problem develop quickly broadly across pool borrowers. successful management concentration require adherence good credit fundamentals. important advance measurement management credit risk develop community banker probably consider use come years. there magic bullet here, community banker may find advance technique provide useful tool concept reinforce exist discipline credit management process. the near-term outlook community bank profitability good, point prospect rate earn growth may bite le rosy large institutions. paradoxically, probably little room low credit cost community banks, unlike large institution still-elevated level problem loans. provision community bank 2003 roughly 50 basis point average loans, low level see community bank since 1998 figure would probably consider “normal” prudent long term. this level loan-loss provision accompany cool fee mortgage refinance origination heighten attention new opportunity asset growth higher-margin assets. most observer expect business borrower soon resume normal level borrow activity. although return may provide one avenue earn growth bank sizes, important competitive drive win borrower allow overcome discipline prudent lend practice. director management particularly attentive possibility give extend period weak loan demand we've recently experienced. a natural temptation banker face pressure earn growth would extend maturity search attractive rate return. i'd like say cautionary word temptation. with steep yield curve, portion community bank asset mature beyond five year grow steadily since year-end 2000, 16.9 percent 18.4 percent assets. large institution hold great share asset long-term instrument also see increase long-term asset period. they arguably may good access derivative market sophisticate program manage interest rate risk. rather resort derivative market - few 600 commercial bank hold derivative contract - community banker may simply choose rely interest rate protection provide stable reliable core deposit base. they may believe base stable reliable large institutions, historical point view belief might difficult dispute. community banker depend deposit maintain stability reliability exhibit past. a result, interest rate liquidity management become even closely intertwined. money market deposit account save deposit community bank grow sharply 2003, although drop slightly - le $2 billion 0.6 percent - fourth quarter. a drop size take place community bank years, occur large banks. if analysis correct deposit growth fuel low interest rate weakness equity markets, community banker aware may face unexpected liquidity interest rate pressure deposit customer shift fund investment vehicles. this idle speculation. we need remember depositor behavior change. an excellent example high-interest rate period experience late 1970s early 1980s, 2 bi review 14/2004 bi review 14/2004 3 long-term certificate deposit redeem early - despite significant penalty assess - order lock high market rates. the relative stability nonmaturity deposit liquidity provide important strength community banks, although many instance rapidly grow bank face unexpected liquidity pressure rely heavily non-core volatile fund sources. careful plan growth fund need key aspect sound management require appropriate degree management attention. conclusion the past year good year industry, one bank able adapt change environment still generate record profits. community bank demonstrate value marketplace prominent vibrant position rightly occupy industry. the industry strong resilient, gauge industry's ability withstand adapt challenge solely basis happen 2003. a reflect banner year, serve u well bear mind credit business challenge industry face recent year certainly difficult might - indeed may yet point future. asset quality certainly issue credit cycle, never approach level experience early 1990s. similarly, low-interest rate environment, together steep yield curve, provide forgive set bankers, least near term. to paraphrase old adage, learn lesson history destine repeat them. once again, fundamental management challenge balance opportunity present prospect future. m r pridiyathorn devakula: achieve financial system stability welcome remark mr m r pridiyathorn devakula, governor bank thailand, conference bank sector issues: weak bank systemic crises, bangkok, 18-20 february 2004. * * * distinguish panelists, honorable guest participants, lady gentlemen, on behalf bank thailand, i would like warmly welcome city bangkok bis/fsi conference. my sincere thank overseas speaker guest follow commitment share expertise international conference despite recent outbreak bird flu. it sincere hope take opportunity see country beyond conference hall enjoy stay thailand. at outset, i would like say i honour opportunity address distinguish audience bank supervise expert corner world. the conference adopt theme: bank sector issues: weak bank systemic crises, timely subject - appropriate critical bank supervisory authorities, since risk management inherent commercial activities. i would like suggest commonly face challenge u all, regardless border stage socio-economic development. i hope course two-and-a-half days' conference, deliberations, emerge expert audience wide array supervision-related issues, shed light best deal weak bank systemic crisis. all bank supervisor central banker seek “holy grail” aspiration stable financial system resilient capable return balance shock. to fulfill common goal, let repeat golden principle sound bank supervision - prevention fundamental avoid bank crisis. we know handle crisis always difficult painful; therefore, supervisor banker share responsibility accountability prevent bank problems. supervisor must create sound framework, foster robust effective system, establish clear procedure identify deal weak banks. this mean supervisor must equip legal power effectively carry duty necessary tools, resource capacity solve problems. these necessary infrastructure build block sound stable financial system. equally important, board management individual bank must shoulder responsibility monitor address bank weaknesses. they cannot fail oversight risk managerial duties, supervisor cannot fail on-site off-site supervision. in respect, i strong believer good governance corner stone stable financial sector. we must create bank community tolerate imprudent business practice lax system control. these sin past. thailand, instance, carefully foster new business culture right values. on part, bank thailand since march 2002 announce guideline support practice good corporate governance banks' board management ensure look interest stakeholder effective manner. these rule ground-breaking; simple common sense. but need communicate clearly private sector expectation consequence effort fail. lady gentlemen, the cost financial restructure thailand was, all, enormous figure painful real term allow u continue old way. in addition change corporate culture, also amend key law solidify foundation financial infrastructure. the new financial institution business act empower bank authority necessary power supervise financial institution consolidate basis take appropriate action weak banks, provision prompt corrective actions. the deposit insurance act support deposit insurance system limit loss public money reduce moral hazard inherent current guarantee system. we must ensure bank failure occur, despite preventive measure utmost effort prevent it, depositor take care fairly, bank's bi review 14/2004 1 2 bi review 14/2004 shareholder accept due share burdens. moreover, draft financial sector master plan foster efficient, stable, competitive financial sector, guide development financial sector medium term. all initiative undertake objective provide right framework effective supervision order develop sound strong bank sector. in regard, i trust discussion next two half day constructive, provide insight issues, well controversial debate - role government lender last resort. allow say word substantial progress make various international body crisis prevention. the imf take lead role, revamp approach sharpen focus crisis prevention, management, resolution. standard code best practice introduce - work coordinate imf, world bank, bis, oecd international experts, underpin financial sector assessment program. the basel committee introduce new basel capital accord, evolutionary supervisory framework. supervision direct away rule-based guideline comprehensive risk-based calculation capital adequacy, methodology operational risk, supervisory review process, market discipline. these example important work accomplish international financial institution various experts. your presence conference best testament solution way crisis prevention still evolving, situation reassessed, tool refined. lady gentlemen, there say “every crisis new crisis” - kind crisis twice - indeed scary thought. we come - book solve bank problem crisis resolution, challenge still enormous. i would like reiterate point make early prevention key weak bank explode full-blown crisis, depth complexity problem could magnitude unimaginable. it think mind i would sum simple message: supervisor never complacent. lady gentlemen, the asian crisis start thailand slightly six year ago, induce train international coordination program discussion prevent recurrence mean manage it. i hope conference add knowledge supervisory tool aid participate supervisor good meet challenge weak bank resolution systemic crisis regardless stage economic development form financial system. i happy thailand venue of, host to, conference - commendable international effort bring u close aspiration sound stable financial system. may i take opportunity thank fsi bi allow u take part event excellent cooperation years. our compliment mr. jason george team efficient organization event. i wish successful conference. thank you. alan greenspan: current account remark mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, economic club new york, new york, 2 march 2004. * * * it number year since foreign exchange rate dollar play prominent role evaluation economic activity. i intention today discuss foreign exchange policy unite states. that province secretary treasury. nor i intend project exchange rates. my experience exchange market become efficient virtually relevant information embed almost instantaneously exchange rate point anticipate movement major currency rarely possible. the exception conclusion case successful speculation government try fail support particular exchange rate. nonetheless, despite extensive effort part analysts, knowledge, model project directional movement exchange rate significantly superior toss coin. i aware thousand try, quite successful. so winner coin-tossing contests. the seem ability number bank organization make consistent profit foreign exchange trade likely derive insight future rate change market making. this may seem rather surprise conclusion, give many commentator apparently believe know real value dollar must decline record current account deficit unite states. it sober recall three year ago - february 2001 - exact similar reason vast majority large panel forecaster project low dollar euro. in subsequent twelve months, dollar rise nearly 6 percent euro. rather engage exchange rate forecasting, today i discus certain development foreign exchange markets, international financial system general, bear ultimate outcome current account adjustment process. before raise broad issue adjustment, i like address action certain player exchange market likely delay adjustment process, time. i refer heavy degree intervention east asian monetary authorities, especially japan china, apparent step hedge currency movement exporters, especially europe. a follow market aware, since start 2002, extraordinary purchase asian central bank government dollar assets, largely japan china, total almost $240 billion, apparent attempt prevent currency rise dollar. in particular, total foreign exchange reserve china reach $420 billion november last year japan $650 billion december. the awesome size japan's accumulation result persistent intervention suppress japanese authority judge dollar-yen exchange rate line fundamentals. one factor boost yen significant yen bias part japanese investors. this propensity, judgment, run far beyond normal tendency investor worldwide buy familiar domestic asset eschew foreign-exchange risk. nowhere else world investor voluntarily purchase ten-year government obligation interest rate 1 percent less, especially give rate increase outstanding supply government debt generally run 9 percent past year. not surprisingly, japanese government bond (jgbs) hold outside japan. aside hold bank japan, almost jgbs hold japanese households, banks, insurance company postal save system. and none hold significant amount foreign assets; 99 percent household asset yen, and, include postal save system, 91 percent asset financial institution yen. japanese nonfinancial corporation hold large share foreign asset securities' portfolios, absolute amount small. the japanese make significant foreign direct investments, especially unite states, ministry finance does, course, hold large dollar balance consequence exchange rate intervention. but japanese private sector, large, bi review 14/2004 1 exhibit limit interest accumulate dollar foreign assets, remove large trade economy would significant segment demand foreign assets. the degree domestic currency bias japan, far exceed trade partners, may thus contribute foreign exchange rate yen appear elevate relative dollar possibly internationally trade currency well.1 of course, preference yen assets, persistent influence value yen, time overwhelm factors. grant level intervention pursue japanese monetary authority influence market value yen, size impact difficult judge. in event, must presume rate accumulation dollar asset japanese government slow point eventually cease. for now, partially unsterilized intervention perceive mean expand monetary base japan, basic element monetary policy. (the effect, course, available purchase domestic assets.) in time, however, present deflationary situation abates, monetary consequence continue intervention could become problematic. the current performance japanese economy suggest get close point continue intervention present scale long meet monetary policy need japan. china similar story. in order maintain tight relationship dollar initiate 1990s, chinese central bank choose purchase large quantity u.s. treasury security renminbi. what clear much current upward pressure currency result underlie market forces, much capital inflow owe speculation potential revaluation, much capital control suppress demand chinese resident dollar currencies. no one truly know whether ease end capital control would lessen pressure currency and, process, also eliminate inflow speculation revaluation. many china, however, fear immediate end control could induce capital outflow large enough destabilize nation's improving, still fragile, bank system. others believe decontrol, gradual pace, could conceivably avoid outcome. chinese central bank purchase dollars, unless offset, threaten excess so-called high-powered money expansion consequent overheat chinese economy. the chinese central bank last year offset - is, sterilize - much heavy dollar purchase reduce loan commercial banks, sell bonds, increase reserve requirements. but ratio money supply monetary base china rise steadily number year financial efficiency improves. thus modest rise occur currency commercial bank reserve enough support twelve-month growth m2 money supply neighborhood 20 percent 2003 bite le far year. should pattern continue, central bank confront choice curtail purchase dollar asset face overheat economy associate economic instabilities. less dollar purchase presumably would allow renminbi, least temporarily, appreciate dollar. other east asian monetary authorities, endeavor hold currency par yen renminbi, accumulate $120 billion reserve 2003 appear continue rate intervention since. * * * there general view heavy intervention place upward pressure euro. it assume dollar's trade-weighted exchange rate reflect worldwide fundamentals, therefore asian currency suppressed, euro non-asian currency need appreciate offset. but likely possibility asian currency intervention little effect currency trade-weighted average dollar is, thus, somewhat elevate relative rate would prevail absent intervention. when asian authority intervene ease currency dollar, purchase dollar-denominated asset private sector portfolios. with few 1 the yen bias certainly exist early decades, become evident japanese growth slowed. 2 bi review 14/2004 dollar asset private hands, natural inclination rebalance portfolio tend buoy dollar even currency use intervention operations, include euro. these transaction raise dollar against, example, yen, low yen euro, low euro dollar. the strength euro dollar thus appear consequence force unrelated asian intervention. a i explain later, mean asian intervention cease dollar automatically fall influence dollar cannot foreseen. some argue purchase u.s. treasury asian official hold interest rate instruments, therefore u.s. interest rate likely rise intervention asian monetary authority slows, ceases, even turn net sales. while obvious reason concern outcome, effect reduction scale intervention, even net sales, u.s. financial market would likely small. the reason central bank reserve heavily concentrate short-term maturities; moreover, overall market short-term dollar assets, combine public private instruments, huge relative size asset hold asian monetary authorities. and issue short-term hence capable limit price change, realize capital losses, any, would small. accordingly, incentive monetary authority sell dollars, order preserve market value, would muted. * * * a different issue arise apparent level hedge exporter europe elsewhere. the effect, however, asian official intervention: it slow process adjustment. against broad basket currency trade partners, foreign exchange value u.s. dollar decline 12 percent peak early 2002. ordinarily, currency depreciation accompany rise dollar price import good services, foreign exporter seek avoid price decline currencies, would otherwise result fall foreign exchange value dollar. reflect swing dollar appreciation dollar depreciation, dollar price good service import unite state begin rise decline balance several years. but turnaround date moderate far short imply exchange rate change. apparently, foreign exporter will absorb price decline measure currency consequent squeeze profit margin entail order hold market share. in fact, give nearly 9 percent rise dollar price good import western europe since start 2002 far short rise euro, profit margin euro-area exporter unite state may well turn negative. nonetheless, euro-area export unite states, express euros, slow modestly. a possible reason european exporters' incentive sell unite state diminish significantly le indicate dollar price exchange rate movement owe accelerate short forward position dollar foreign exchange markets. a mark increase foreign exchange derivative trading, especially dollar-euro, accord bank international settlements, consistent increase hedge export unite state market use currency tie u.s. dollar.2 however, contract short-term long-term hedge expensive. thus, although hedge may delay, perhaps even smooth out, adjustment, cannot eliminate, without prohibitive cost, consequence exchange rate change. accordingly, currency depreciation experience late eventually help contain current account deficit foreign producer export le unite states. on side ledger, current account improve u.s. firm find export market receptive. but process, dollar price import surely rise. * * * when temporary forestall u.s. balance payment adjustment process come end, suggest steepen decline dollar's exchange rate? 2 that many export even europe price dollar trade convention. it affect cost domestic currency exporter incur. bi review 14/2004 3 a i point beginning, sophisticate analytical technique unable profitably project exchange rate major currencies. yet, commentator argue current account deficit must eventually narrow, price-adjusted value dollar must accordingly decline. but exchange rate current account systematically related, exchange rate inherently unpredictable? the answer point u.s. current account deficit force narrow inherently difficult predict. the current account reflect myriad force bring transaction foreign economy balance borders, exchange rate one. but force that, end, reflect current account surplus deficit domestic foreign. indeed, current account balance show exactly equal difference domestic save domestic investment. in fact, often instructive longer-term analysis view current account term domestic counterparts. a i point speech last november,3 virtually trade partner share inclination invest disproportionate percentage domestic save domestic capital assets, irrespective differential rate return. people seem prefer invest familiar local business even currency country risk exist. for unite states, study show individual investor even professional money manager slight preference investment community states. trust, crucial aspect investing, likely foster familiarity local communities. a consequence, “home bias” likely continue constrain movement world save optimum use capital investment, thus limit internationalization financial intermediation hence growth external asset liability dispersion world current account balance growth implies. nonetheless, past decade, home bias apparently decline significantly. for early post world war ii era, correlation domestic save rate domestic investment rate across world's major economies, conventional measure home bias, exceptionally high.4 for member country organization economic cooperation development (oecd) , gdp-weighted correlation coefficient 0.97 1970. however, fell 0.96 1992 le 0.8 2002. for oecd country exclude unite states, recent decline even pronounced. these declines, surprisingly, mirror rise difference save investment or, equivalently, dispersion current account balance years. the decline home bias probably reflect increase international tendency financial system transparent, open, supportive strong investor protection.5 moreover, vast improvement information communication technology broaden investors' vision point foreign investment appear le exotic risky. accordingly, trend decline home bias expand international financial intermediation likely continue. this process enable unite state incur finance much large current account deficit would feasible early decades. it quite difficult contemplate foreign save amount equivalent 5 percent u.s. gdp transfer unite state two three decade ago. * * * it unclear whether burden service grow external liability rise weight u.s. asset global portfolio impose great restraint current account dispersion long term. either way, point arrives, process rein current account deficit benign economy unite state world? 3 alan greenspan, speech 21st annual monetary conference, cosponsor cato institute economist, washington, d.c., november 20, 2003. 4 see martin feldstein charles horioka, “domestic save international capital flows,” the economic journal, june 1980, 314-29. 5 research indicate home bias investment toward foreign country likely diminish extent country's financial system offer transparency, accessibility, investor safeguards. see alan ahearne, william griever, frank warnock, “information cost home bias: an analysis u.s. hold foreign equities,” journal international economics, march 2004, page 313 36. 4 bi review 14/2004 accord federal reserve staff study, current account deficit emerge among develop country since 1980 rise high double-digit percentage gdp market enforce reversal.6 the median high 5 percent gdp. complicate evaluation time turnaround deficit countries, develop emerging, borrow international market largely dollar rather domestic currency. the unite state rare ability finance external deficit reserve currency. this ability presumably enlarge capability unite state relative trade partner incur foreign debt. besides experience current account deficit countries, useful guidepost high country's net foreign liability mount. the foreign accumulation u.s. asset would likely slow dollar assets, irrespective competitive return, come occupy large share world's portfolio store value assets. in circumstances, investor would seek great diversification non-dollar assets. at end 2002, u.s. dollar account 65 percent foreign exchange reserve foreign monetary authorities, euro second 19 percent. approximately half private cross-border hold denominate dollars, one-third euros. * * * more important way adjustment u.s. current account deficit initiate effect adjustment economy economy trade partners. the history adjustment mixed. accord aforementioned federal reserve study current account correction develop countries, although large majority episode characterize significant slow economic growth, economy manage adjustment without crisis. the institutional strength many develop economy - rule law, transparency, investor property protection - likely help minimize disruption associate current account adjustments. the unite kingdom, however, significant adjustment difficulty early postwar years, did, recently, mexico, thailand, korea, russia, brazil, argentina, name few. can market force incrementally defuse worrisome buildup nation's current account deficit net external debt crisis abruptly so? the answer seem lie degree flexibility domestic international markets. in domestic economy approach full flexibility, imbalance likely adjust well become potentially destabilizing. in similarly flexible world economy, debt projection rise, product equity prices, interest rates, exchange rate could change, presumably reestablish global balance. the experience past two century trade finance among individual state make unite state come close paradigm flexibility even though exchange rate among state fixed. although scant data cross-border transaction among separate states, anecdotal evidence suggest decade significant apparent imbalance resolve without precipitate interstate balance payment crises. the dispersion unemployment rate among states, one measure imbalances, spike period economic stress rapidly return modest levels, reflect high degree adjustment flexibility. that flexibility even apparent regional money markets, interest rate presumably reflect differential imbalance states' current account hence cross-border borrow requirement have, recent years, exhibit little interstate dispersion. this observation suggest either negligible cross-state-border imbalances, unlikely occurrence give pattern state unemployment dispersion, likely rapid financial adjustments. * * * we may able usefully determine point foreign accumulation net claim unite state slow even reverse, evident great degree international flexibility, le risk crisis.7 the experience unite state past three year 6 caroline freund, “current account adjustment industrialize countries,” board governor federal reserve

jürgen stark, vice president deutsche bundesbank, dinner the money marketeers, new york, 25 february 2004. * * * i it honour pleasure privilege address today economic perspective germany euro area whole. a central banker, i prefer focus change late monthly sentiment indicator quarterly growth figures, rather longer-term issue essential stability-oriented monetary policy, potential growth economy’s resilience shocks. i shall also highlight difference similarity economic fundamental europe unite states. european economic monetary union (emu) sixth year euro single currency. these year fairly demand despite number sizeable adverse shocks, eurosystem, consist european central bank euro area national central banks, manage deliver credible monetary policy stance. in run-up emu outset, many sceptic query feasibility “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy decentralise closely coordinate economic budgetary policy. the area see heterogeneous demand regime. such criticism become le vociferous recently due monetary policy track record, prof credibility test pass far. average inflation close 2% long-term inflation expectation well contained, close mostly escb definition price stability 2%. the growth performance germany euro area whole le encouraging. however, three year sluggish growth, region finally show increase sign moderate cyclical economic recovery. the underlie condition strengthen economic growth remain favourable. finance condition generally supportive, low nominal real interest rates. the restructure corporate balance sheets, particularly germany, make considerable progress. robust growth major trade partner also aid economic recovery process. the favourable impact world trade world growth dynamic important export recent decline price competitiveness cause appreciation euro. the debate potential adverse effect strong euro distract u real underlie obstacle growth europe. i would sketch full picture economic outlook i fail mention risk broaden global recovery. four factors, particular, watch carefully. firstly, global imbalances, especially persistent u current account deficit. accord oecd, likely surpass us$600 billion 2005, equivalent 5% gdp. the deficit grow dollar term relative size economy. what mean? why issue year ago issue now? basically, answer question source finance deficit shift private public sector. from u perspective problem long foreigner will continue supply savings. but composition external finance become unbalance and, grow extent, rely foreign central bank purchase u treasuries. the willingness overseas investor hold ever-growing dollar-denominated portfolio obviously something cannot go ever. secondly, protectionist pressure. when alan greenspan speak globalisation last month bundesbank lecture 2004 berlin, remind u virtue open markets. he stated: “it bi review 14/2004 1 imperative creep protectionism thwart reversed”.1 this insight come surprise economist, message easily forgotten. unfortunately, something hold true side atlantic. withstand archaic reflex response emerge protectionism sometimes quixotic experience. but never forget open market free trade multilateral world key prosperity - side atlantic. thirdly, large fiscal deficit major economic region increase debt-to-gdp ratios. it cannot rule worldwide deterioration fiscal position sooner late lead market reactions. an appreciable rise interest rate expect investor begin doubt longer-term sustainability public finances. finally, ample liquidity. that say gap global scale real money growth real gdp growth. this excess liquidity nurture risk appetite investors. the search yield lead considerable narrow corporate bond emerge market sovereign spreads. if excess liquidity mop point time, find way term push inflation feed new asset price bubble could costly unwind. ii the global economic recovery present mainly drive two centre gravity: u economy emerge asia. the euro area lag behind. why growth performance euro area germany sluggish past years? growth differential unite state euro area part non-cyclical phenomenon. for instance, estimate overall production potential differ significantly. the u experience might hold important policy lesson regard quite lively debate europe need become like unite states. in nutshell: contest pro con anglo-american free market model european model social cohesion. i shall try remedy certain misunderstand misperceptions arise country-specific factor compared. the late growth figure unite state impressive. however, think term prosperity developments, necessary apply per caput assessment. a country fast-growing population need generate great increase real income country le rapidly expand population wish maintain even increase prosperity citizens. the euro area's annual population growth 1996 2003 ¼% (in germany 0.1%), whereas u population grow average 1% owe high birth rate sizeable influx immigrants. thus, annual real gdp change 2.0% euro area (1.2% germany) 3.3% u per caput term 1.7% euro area (1.1% germany) 2.2% us. the per caput growth differential therefore “only” roughly one-third overall figure, could narrow methodological difference regard measurement deflation depreciation incorporated. the small per caput difference mean justify complacency. however, good reflection improvement achieve standard living. it still show per caput growth gap usa europe grow converging. and one also take consideration fact unite state already considerably high level. in 2002, gdp per caput basis purchase power parity one-third large unite state euro area. what main element behind developments? low gdp per caput mean low national live standards. economic well-being largely determine productivity. look labour productivity, strike factor labour efficiently incorporate production process europe. the labour force participation rate euro area - member workforce relation population work age - 68% 8 percentage point low unite states. 1 alan greenspan (2004), remark bundesbank lecture 2004, berlin. 2 bi review 14/2004 labour utilisation europe germany decline significantly, mainly due three factors. 1. the preference short work week long holidays. work hour per person employ last 25 year remain virtually unchanged around 1,800 hour per year unite states, whereas germany, average number hour employee work around 1,450 hours, 15% low 25 year ago. 2. withdrawal labour force, include high participation early retirement scheme since early 1980s. the average retirement age present germany france 59 years. 3. the rise unemployment, since late 1970s 8.8% labour force. an interim conclusion may draw this: popular european belief distribution presumably fix amount labour would lead great work opportunity become reality. on contrary, lead high non-wage labour cost high taxes, become impediment economic growth job creation. labour productivity per hour work present unite state germany. however, since mid-1990s, increase hourly productivity low unite states. accord oecd study,2 main factor behind smaller-scale use slow diffusion information communication technology (ict) le intensive research development. other factor play role institutional difference labour market rigidity relatively entangle web regulations. take together, result hard core structural unemployment. in particular, europe le successful unite state integrate “marginal” le productive member labour force economic process. a good inclusion part labour force might transitionally slow change labour productivity, would still increase overall welfare. of course, available data interpret caution. statistical source vary society deep-seated structural cultural difference make comparison difficult. nevertheless, despite terminological, conceptual empirical difficulties, cross-country comparison still remain important indicator evaluate policy measures. last least, low productivity per employee unite state is, part, reflection democratic choice preference european society short work time, is, economic terms, substitution consumption opportunity leisure. however, interpret economic inefficiency. it could also argue u worker work long hour euro area colleague maintain similar per caput growth rates. occasionally, suggest material live standard consider also indicator welfare, robert j. gordon done.3 accord analysis, gdp unite state bloat due, instance, huge cost keep two million resident prison jail (700 inmate per 100,000 residents, whereas germany 80 inmate per 100,000 residents), high primary energy consumption per caput owe extreme climate (energy consumption germany per caput half high) elevate transportation cost account great dispersion u population. these factor boost gdp without create welfare. i will make value judgement issues. nevertheless, factor keep back one’s mind compare development gdp. iii in germany, three year almost stagnate economy lead call “rhineland model capitalism” subject intense scrutiny. this development raise question economy, also german society political system. 2 oecd (2003), ict economic growth: evidence oecd countries, industry firms, paris. 3 robert j. gordon (2002), two century economic growth: chase american frontier, northwestern university. bi review 14/2004 3 the late rudi dornbusch describe germany economy two faces.4 on one hand, immensely successful country, prosperous stable, among high live standard world. on hand, country plain stick mass unemployment, slow growth, idea even le courage try. i don’t believe last two criticism still hold true. le year ago, situation become serious bundesbank felt impel take unusual step central bank publish reform strategy base thorough analysis. to overcome prevail crisis confidence, call coherent overall approach structural reform labour market, social security system fiscal policy. the momentum reform almost tangible. the government already start implement number important measure agenda 2010. this design increase, time, growth potential german economy include - labour market - pension system - health care reforms. the objective flexible economy bring social security system line economic capacity. it imperative corrective measure implement timely manner. unfortunately, experience show political sphere often 20 year pas awareness social economic challenge addressed. not mention difficulty gain popular support mere acceptance structural changes. however, policy must confine “art possible”. policy also art make possible necessary. the general public begin realise deep-seated german proclivity consensus work environment low growth rates. much remain do crucial impetus falter. the structure germany’s constitution different layer check balance make difficult obtain large parliamentary majority need implement daunt reforms. this pronounce decentralise system firmly root german history. it hamper enormous economic upswing second half last century, encounter difficulty cop change become necessary owe reunification, european integration, globalisation demographic challenges. iv structural change possible europe. the convince recent example european economic monetary union. the creation single european currency far-reaching challenge monetary event take place since bretton wood conference 1944 changeover flexible exchange rate early 1970s. the true dimension political project often underestimated. the true economic benefit materialise time. a monetary union ground share values. the basis share value definition member states’ economic policy enshrine maastricht treaty principle open market economy free competition. however, another fundamental policy decision also necessary introduction single currency, namely willingness transfer national monetary sovereignty supranational institution. the concomitant renunciation sovereignty signify profound break historical political self-perception eu member states. european economic monetary union possible backdrop share traditions, decades-long process integration successful convergence 1990s. the opportunity 4 rudi dornbusch (2000), key prosperity, mit. 4 bi review 14/2004 create single european currency unleash great energy eu member states. in process convergence, inflation rates, interest rate government debt reduce benefit participate economies. give reliable underlie economic policy conditions, exchange rate relationship foreign exchange market within europe able stabilise. those country use weak currency gain especially since risk premium capital market rate decrease appreciably. overall, economic financial policy become gear medium term predictable result. essentially, mean member state say goodbye stop-and-go policy often use pursued. despite differ economic policy standpoint traditions, possible develop put place joint stability-oriented strategy economic monetary union. that would possible without political courage shape events. at juncture, let introduce another institutional pillar european monetary union: stability growth pact, aim limit risk price stability might otherwise arise national “free rider” fiscal policies. from macroeconomic stabilisation perspective, central budget european union, roughly 1% eu gdp, insignificant europe. the crucial stabilise role compare u government expenditure 34% play national budget member countries, whose general government expenditure account 48% euro area gdp. that one reason emu need counterweight politico-economic incentive borrow without penalise adequately financial market term high interest rate premium compensation national inflation depreciation risk. the stability growth pact therefore also insurance policy country adhere sound fiscal policies. this framework fiscal discipline make long-run sustainability public finance short-term stabilisation compatible. the objective achieve medium-term budgetary position close balance surplus. an additional rationale stability growth pact urgent need take account unfavourable demographic trend europe. such trend exist unite state well, le pronounced. by 2050 share elderly people (≥65 years) population go 12% 21% unite state 16% 28% eu. within fiscal framework stability growth pact, automatic stabiliser allow operate freely long upper ceiling 3% deficit endangered. the high general government ratio europe structure social transfer payment make automatic stabiliser twice effective unite states. a result, discretionary fiscal policy well-known pro-cyclical drawback le issue. however, governments’ degree commitment rule procedure stability growth pact encourage recently. the credibility framework cast doubt. this development jeopardise confidence sustainability public finance euro area. european especially german consumer seem ricardian nature american consumer are. that say, lose confidence soundness public finance tend regard high deficit today high tax tomorrow, therefore increase save hold back consumption. occasionally, monetary policy eurosystem blame slow growth performance euro area. by token, acknowledge ecb fulfil mandate. consequently, argue mandate change reflect goal federal reserve system. i believe line reason root unfamiliarity fundamental within euro area. but let also raise two important questions. 1. what role focus monetary policy? 2. what achieve monetary policy? in answer question allow make follow points. firstly, primary focus european monetary policy maintain price stability medium term. the clear straightforward mandate recognise best contribution monetary policy make environment conducive growth job creation. this mandate bi review 14/2004 5 6 bi review 14/2004 least outdated. it reflect limitation monetary policy mirror late insight monetary theory practical experience. secondly, mandate also reflect historical experience. the hyperinflation occur european countries, especially germany, 1920s leave profound impression subsequent generations. in unite states, great depression leave mark important factor explain mandate give u congress federal reserve consist three non-prioritised goal “maximum employment, stable price moderate long-term interest rates”. thirdly, structural difference continental europe unite states, degree structural flexibility, impact transmission mechanism time lag monetary policy. what i particularly mind context difference transmission arise market-based financial system bank-based one, fact change short-term interest rate play far le important role investment decision continental europe unite states. finally, say that, bear mind monetary policy appropriate tool fine-tune business cycle balance deficiency policy areas. at time, much emphasis place monetary policy response short-term macroeconomic development even indicators. activist policy direct exploit short-term trade-off price economic growth bear risk contribute instability medium long term. in final analysis, central bank concern price stability. i would place much store statement inflation may eradicated, even assertion come every well-known economists. such statement put matter strongly rather heroic assumptions. a world basic economic relation cease exist dangerous promise make - perhaps comparable irrational exuberance surround hype “new economy”. low inflation experience recent history. it track record stretch decades. and - far euro area concern - eurosystem responsibility region inflation-prone history. v let summarise important lessons. 1. up now, monetary policy euro area successful. our experience anchor inflation expectation reinforce commitment medium-term approach. great activism would harm good, especially consider environment little structural flexibility. 2. we need overcome disappoint weak economic performance germany euro area whole. let clear this: economic problem continental europe cannot reduce monetary policy issues. what need structural reform member states, include pension reform, health insurance reform labour market reform. fortunately, general recognition importance structural flexibility term raise long-term growth potential increase resilience economic shocks. address issue rebuild confidence. even large economy show willingness tackle structural impediments. 3. put fiscal position back sound track stick fiscal rule sgp would help restore confidence. the credibility consolidation measure crucial. fiscal adjustment see lead permanent increase future disposable income. moreover, appropriately designed, consolidation raise output employment medium term. positive result likely produce short run consolidation combine structural reforms. 4. the integration europe ongoing process, always develop smoothly might hop for. but, eventually, challenge meet groundwork new challenge enlargement eu ten new member state well laid. nevertheless, policymakers live responsibilities. emu offer opportunity dynamic europe. susan schmidt bies: qualitative aspect effective risk management remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, global association risk professional fifth annual convention, new york, 25 february 2004. * * * good morning. i delight garp’s 5th annual risk management convention support, extent i can, work organization. it’s gratify see progress garp make short life toward promote visibility quality risk management profession. i congratulate progress make wish success year ahead. i spend much career field risk management, certainly federal reserve keen interest matter. for u spend year business, easy see recent progress quantitative scientific aspect risk management result data base technological advances. these increase capability help push financial theory open door mind new way measure manage risk. these advance also make possible development important new market product become widespread essential risk management practice financial nonfinancial firms. they also make practice risk management far sophisticate complex. the application mathematics statistics, collection compilation large amount data, analysis characterization risk embed business activity today much different - many way challenge - long ago. while enhance quantitative dimension risk measurement may quite visible (at least practitioner art), implication qualitative aspect risk management may le apparent. in practice, though, qualitative aspect le important successful operation business - event continue demonstrate. a risk measurement practice advance, full range risk management practice need keep pace. in remark today, i would like highlight advance risk management see recent years, particularly relate management transfer credit risk. these gain development new important market come good risk-measurement technique potential, i believe, substantially improve efficiency u.s. world financial markets. however, economist, i also know free lunch; implication development fundamental element risk management must consider adequately address quantitative aspect work well. for obvious reasons, i focus practice large commercial banks. competitive innovative market i would like draw observation gather federal reserve’s role bank supervision work good understand recent practice financial institution manage transfer credit risk. i find preliminary assessment informative, interesting, least somewhat reassuring; however, i also feel appropriately highlight vulnerability market practice must carefully monitor managed. because much innovation credit risk transfer involve credit derivatives, attention focus transaction use instrument credit default swap (cds), particular. by way note, federal reserve also participate work commission last year financial stability forum gain broad understand issues. i look forward conclusion assessment regard. a know, credit default swap involve sale, transfer, credit risk associate specific reference entity fix term exchange fee counterparty (the “protection buyer”). relate instrument - synthetic collateralize debt obligation (cdos) - entail similar arrangements, base portfolio exposure “tranched” manner typically see securitizations. consequently, cdos, party gain even great flexibility tailor market financial transaction match risk appetite ultimate investors, risk takers. bi review 13/2004 1 this market grow rapidly recent years, attract increase attention among risk manager lead large operation high staff level - particularly dealer firms. the british banker association, example, report notional value credit derivative grow le $200 billion 1997 nearly $2 trillion 2002. our bank call report indicate late last year u.s. commercial bank hold credit derivative notional value $800 billion, may represent one-third global market. trade instrument occur mostly among 1,200 large investment-grade “reference entities,” liquidity, course, among active fifty name among next several hundred. most liquidity cd contract five-year maturities, although participant try expand market depth long terms. there also effort push demand beyond investment-grade corporate names, example high-yield middle-market sectors. a key question - much risk transferred? - difficult answer due participation market many type regulate unregulated investor firm well fact participant simply reverse close one exposure enter additional offset one, type swaps. to sure, notional amount substantially overstate level risk transfer, accounts, market participant seem agree volume risk transfer material. anecdotally, large bank indicate hedge 15 percent investment-grade corporate credit. standard poor’s estimate bank system globally use credit derivative transfer risk associate $300 billion exposures. but s&p acknowledge estimate likely overstate true level risk transfer cd almost exclusively write low-risk, investment-grade credits, bank issue cdos typically retain risky tranches. even so, seem risk management practice important govern credit risk large bank organization and, many respects, reduce systemic risk, well. despite common practice bank issue cdos retain much first-loss “expected-loss” tranche, bank least reduce previous, full credit exposure. moreover, sale purchase cd also allow bank manage concentration diversify portfolios. in event highly unexpected default among investment-grade firms, hedge bank’s loss reduced. the experience credit derivative enron, world com, parmalat events, indicate new risk product work effectively. one aspect we, bank supervisors, find encourage growth credit risk transfer activity diversification benefit provide - potential great economic efficiency. certainly, risk transfer bank leave bank sector. s&p estimate roughly one-half risk remain bank sector. the insurance sector, include reinsurance firms, major participant among nonbank firms. among banks, belief europe asia net seller credit protection, particularly respect north american borrowers. such credit flows, whether within outside bank system, help enhance geographic diversification protection-seller add liquidity debt offer reference firms. by distribute risk broadly among major player - banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, private asset manager - transaction would seem almost definition add diversity strength financial market reduce risk concentrations. by design, derivative instrument segment risk distribution party will accept them. a key point, however, party also able successfully absorb diffuse subsequent loss. in event, reduce evenly redistribute risk within bank system - credit risk traditionally concentrate - would seem clear benefit. a second question certainly interest risk management professional whether participant recognize understand underlie risks. it important recognize market credit default swap dominate large institution private investor specialize expertise credit analysis significant historical performance records. participant always adjust position move market gain experience, certainly lesson learn along way. we learn them, hopefully deal well - far. but little evidence, date, suggest material weakness knowledge understand major market-making dealers. that said, i would offer one critical caveat regard potential large group market participant place over-reliance external rat key model assumptions. in particular, price risk management increasingly complex credit risk transfer instrument 2 bi review 13/2004 trade strategy rely credit risk model support assumptions, include assumption degree default correlation different reference entities. although future correlation cannot measured, correlation period normal condition change greatly period stress. time tell robust model whether perform well. market participant must consider whether concentration reliance small set risk management framework approach credit risk transfer (crt) market. this issue arise regard report similarity credit risk model assumption use major market participants. of course, nothing inherently wrong convergence risk management approaches. but case, give widespread view model still relative infancy, similarity perhaps worth noting. this issue also arise relation reliance rat agency rat methodology regard cdo tranche relate structures. ideally, market participant invest substantial amount cdos would capacity undertake analysis risks, rat agency rat would function supplement analyses. in practice, however, likely substantial reliance place rat agency’s rating. consequently, risk judgment many market participant concentrate hand small number public rat agencies. in context commercial bank past credit-related failure substantial widespread effects, also close government supervision, focus primarily risk management practice control relate evolve market practices. i would minute suggest oversight ensure go well future. but help reinforce effective risk management, learn grow list case studies. qualitative aspect this discussion role derivative transfer credit risk serf illustrate many important - always highly technical - aspect risk management cannot overlooked. some issue relate nascent feature particular market, apply market well, sheer complexity measure risk. think legal risk, operational risk, reputational risk, counterparty credit risk, model risk come mind. for part, central banker bank supervisor must also consider implication new products, activities, management innovation financial markets, systemic risk, prudential regulations. the combine implication market innovation issue profound challenging, but, i would submit, overall beneficial market efficiency. we simply must manage process well. in legal arena, financial industry made, continue make, substantial progress, example, standardize net agreement relate derivative instrument reduce relate misunderstand difference among institution legal jurisdictions. understand market practices, relate settle transaction use “cheapest deliver,” know certain specific legal entity reference party credit risk swap also crucial, low tech element successful risk management process. uncertainty exist complicate operation. they typically great associate innovation grow product structure become complex. we need recognize this. regard models, aside technical parts, it’s important consider le quantitative. for instance, input sound? be model parameter base sufficiently robust accurate data? be assumption reasonable? one need understand business risk management principles, require “quant.” in modeling, “gigo” - garbage in, garbage - always rules. data integrity grow importance effective risk management. in today’s world credit risk models, especially centralize underwrite area consumer, mortgage, small business credit, responsibility data input may reside lend officer. to ensure effective underwriting, culture incentive loan officer support accountability valid information go model. in “old days” individual loan officer make credit decisions, weakness underwrite confine lender’s portfolio. it responsibility loan reviewer identify weakness loss become extensive. today, responsibility effectively predict default loss give default reside senior credit officer responsible credit score model. when underwrite result test reliability, critical identify root bi review 13/2004 3 cause error due model specification change customer behavior. the risk centralized, model-based underwrite error long limit portfolio single loan officer. rather, model error create significant systemic risk across loan product portfolio. we still try learn estimate type risks. in current regulatory effort develop internal rating-based capital standard credit risk, find simply identify describe “minimum” data requirement challenge. what adequate robust give purpose not? each company’s practice unique - be. we wish create moral hazard great systemic risk associate highly specific, government-dictated procedure measure risk. rather, want discipline gain require input data parameter use regulatory purpose -as much possible - use business purposes, market-tested. difference among model result occur, management regulator must decide good enough respective purposes. some answer judgmental empirical. experience, judgment, sound degree prudence important. in old days, bank often small certainly le complex business. in small scale, management could gain direct “feel” customers, exposures, relate risk. and potential consequence make mistake typically small well. if bank bad loan underwriter, could dismiss person proceed clean mess. a many bank organization grow much large far complex institutions, personal feel often get lost. their management need sophisticate systematic process risk model provide, also need ensure incorrect weak model bring house. i would offer success area often require grey hair keen intuition well highly develop analytical skills. beyond points, account disclosure practice must consider relate matter earn volatility, customer suitability, incentive disincentive provide risk managers. fundamental element corporate governance must also adequately address - naturally become challenge activity become complex. nevertheless, cannot ignored, give corporate scandal recent year legislate remedy followed. recent failure corporate governance - whether enron, parmalat, new york stock exchange - change landscape underlie many transaction conduct financial institutions. the implication sarbanes-oxley legislation felt throughout corporate america prove expensive many firms. how much better, all, corporation behave responsibly along! responsible self-governance sound corporate governance much good far le costly rigid governmental-imposed rules. a great awareness business ethic reshape account practice incentive package help. but risk manager must also play active role focus sound practices, expedience. accounting, disclosure, market discipline revelation significant corporate governance account failures, parmalat late example, demonstrate strong accounting, effective internal external auditing, transparent disclosure practice critical concern worldwide, one part world, unite states. event international level renew attention need company worldwide implement high-quality corporate governance practice account disclosure standards, external auditor employ rigorous sound international audit techniques. long come federal reserve, i strong interest become involve accounting, auditing, internal control matters. this lead serve financial account standard board’s emerge issue task force committee corporate report financial executive institute. i continue pursue interest role federal reserve board member chair board’s committee supervisory regulatory affairs. i would like, now, turn recent account issue surround complex instrument role financial disclosure promote risk management. for starters, i please see movement recognize employee stock option grant business expense. at year-end 2003, thirty-five fifty large u.s. bank hold company closely monitor quarter take approach, notable increase year before. 4 bi review 13/2004 many nonbank firm well, expect see many company period ahead. in view, useful step toward accurately disclose company’s true results, one help rebuild investor confidence financial statements. the technique value financial derivative - whether employee stock options, mortgage interest rate lock commitments, credit default swaps, another type - continue evolve. a market grow, fair-value estimate improve. in process, firm type face grow competitive pressure manage risk effectively make great use products. account rule disclosure practice must keep pace. a frequently cite issue effect current hedge account rules, sometimes cause bank recognize loss credit hedge ignoring, earnings, offset gain economic value asset hedged. this lead great earn volatility understandably cause bank reassess, case scale back, credit hedge activities. if market discipline function, account board must find better, more-innovative solution accurately capture underlie economics transactions. moreover, regard securitizations, derivatives, innovative instrument transfer risk, clear account measure company’s balance sheet give point time sufficient reflect company’s financial risk profile. a bank regulators, recognize need strike right balance decide disclosure standard promote. it say every complex issue answer simple, concise, wrong. we would prefer get right. we need identify information sufficiently inform investor risk level without unduly burdensome without reveal proprietary information. much answer may involve disclosure risk manage valued, draw le account information information available risk management reports. disclosure need fully standardized; rather firm tell story. one area improve disclosure bank organization need involve credit risk allowance loan losses. a know, high degree management judgment estimate loan-loss allowance, estimate significant impact institution’s balance sheet earnings. expand disclosure area would improve market participants’ understand institution’s risk profile whether firm adequately provide estimate credit loss consistent, well-disciplined manner. accordingly, i strongly encourage institution provide additional disclosure area. example include breakdown credit exposure internal credit grade, allowance estimate break key components, more-thorough discussion allowance component change period period, enhance discussion rationale behind change more-subjective allowance estimates, include unallocated amounts. it also important note soon-to-be-released enterprise risk management (erm) framework committee sponsor organization treadway commission, coso, provide much need guidance area risk management internal control and, thus, particular interest bank regulators. the erm framework, proposed, require entity identify potential event may affect operation require entity systematically manage risk particular emphasis risk appetite strategic direction. the framework predicate existence sound control effective management. successful application framework require manager consider current plan anticipate operational market change identify risk arise changes. once risk identify comprehensively, assessed, evaluate potential impact organization, management must determine effectiveness exist control develop implement additional mitigate control needed. this critical step perform properly, may doom entire process. one weakness see delegation management development assessment internal control structure risk management, internal control, compliance group. it important emphasize line management responsibility identify risk ensure mitigate control effective - leave assessment group independent line organization. manager expect evaluate risk control within scope authority least annually report result process chief risk officer audit committee board directors. an independent group, internal audit, perform separate assessment confirm management’s assessment. bi review 13/2004 5 internal audit’s review determine whether firm accomplish state control objectives, light growth change firm’s business mix well regard new customers, strategic initiatives, reorganizations, process changes. internal audit also evaluate entity’s adherence control process ass adequacy process relate disclosure practice light complexity legal reputational risk profile organization. it essential internal audit staff personnel necessary skill experience report degree compliance entity’s policy procedures. internal audit test transaction validate business line comply firm’s standard report result test board audit committee, appropriate. although i refer internal audit, key point strong internal controls, sound corporate governance, effective disclosure practice require periodic assessment overall effectiveness perform independent group. then, corporate disclosure practice evolve, market analyst must part understand information, recognize value limitations. analyst need make sure correctly use available information. this include understand account practice may result best presentation economic reality source information may provide more-accurate insight company’s condition. for example, current account rule defined-benefit pension plan permit firm use expectation long-term return asset calculate current-period pension costs. a spot rate use discount future liabilities. the discrepancy assume actual return reconcile gradual amortization. this smooth feature create large distortion economic reality pension-financing cost accrual embed income statement. a recent study federal reserve staff member indicate “full disclosure” underlie detail would necessarily assist analyst reach “correct” judgment.1 the study adopt premise investor need know true pension-financing cost reflect two number disclose pension footnote. these two number fair-market value pension asset present value outstanding pension liabilities. the study find two number tend ignore investor favor potentially mislead account measures. investor analyst need ensure information use accurately reflect organization consideration. also, bank employee use financial statement potential borrower make credit-related decision need understand document use able identify potential shortfalls. too often, analyst rely heavily projection interpretation give management. recent event inject independence analysis process help wean many analyst cfo investor relation departments. more-insightful more-independent analysis help greatly promote market discipline identify company’s true worth. that progress, turn, strengthen input data risk-measurement system rely on. throughout supervisory regulatory efforts, federal reserve is, indeed, look market signals. for example, information contain subordinate debt spreads, credit default swap spreads, kmv edfs, equity price provide useful indication market’s collective assessment company’s underlie risk. in banks, information support credit judgment overall measure institution’s capital adequacy credit risk. a regulator worldwide move finalize new capital standards, role market information risk management grow further, particularly among large banks, oversight activities. before closing, i would like take central banker hat speak industry observer former bank cfo. i want simply note historically low level interest rate within work experience many investment risk managers. the typical response try increase nominal yield widen spreads. thus, bank act extend portfolio duration accept risk, give steep yield curve, statistic likely tell odds rate increase great decline. we also see investor attempt increase nominal yield invest lower-rated bonds. but skill association’s member practice, remind u goal appropriate “risk management,” is, give 1 julia coronado steve sharpe, “did pension account contribute stock market bubble?” brook paper economic activity, july 2003. 6 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 7 organization’s risk appetite, attractiveness high yield must always balance increase level risk transaction. and time turn business interest rate cycles, estimate tradeoff difficult. that prediction near future rate movement - advice experience manager interest rate risk. conclusion in remark morning, i seek encourage continue effort support evolution risk-management practice heighten degree professionalism every effective risk manager demonstrate. i would like leave remind become catch late technical development lose sight qualitative aspect responsibilities. model alone guarantee

money finance. i would especially like express deep thank prof. choi, woonyoul, president korea monetary finance association, involve arrange meaningful timely forum invite address today. prof. choi one monetary policy committee member bank korea end last year contribute greatly bank’s conduct monetary policy. take opportunity i thank service term office. the finance association four country take part forum engage lively research activity academic exchange contribute mightily financial sector development country entire western pacific basin region. your forum also focus attention discussion center mainly matter common concern throughout east asia, namely plan promote regional cooperation growth financial sector. the position east asia world economy lady gentlemen, well aware, east asia achieve high rate economic growth last half century, major pole global economy. japan long ago join rank advance country post-war reconstruction economy. korea, part, achieve miracle han river rise phoenix-like ash korean war utter destitution become member often call rich man’s club oecd 1996. since 1980s, china also maintain rapid growth average around 9% pave way great new economic power. a result, east asia’s economic profile greatly heightened. japan, china korea rank 2nd, 6th 12th country respectively term scale economy combine gdp three country represent 18% world whole. in course dramatic economic spring forward, east asia accumulate immense foreign reserves. a end last year, foreign reserve japan, china korea amount 1.2 trillion dollars. the total taiwan hongkong add in, make half world’s foreign reserves. east asian reserve mainly invest u.s treasuries. this mean large proportion american fiscal current account deficit finance east asian countries. fragility financial sector east asia despite dramatic growth real economy, east asian financial sector trail u.s europe. the japanese financial industry world leader term scale financial assets. it prove unable, however, adapt liberalization market openness. it structural fragility lay bare result protract recession last decade. after foreign currency crisis 1997, korean financial sector turn back old system achieve rebirth thoroughgoing structural reform. nevertheless soundness profit financial institution worsen last year line rise household insolvencies. bi review 13/2004 1 the trouble status credit card company still remain big problem, destabilize financial market one cause subdue state domestic demand. in chinese financial sector, say still much room improvement term legal institutional infrastructure. notably, process rapid economic growth, bank sector expand loan state company rapidly hold great stock non-performing loans. this overhang represent latent threat could hold back sustain development chinese economy late stage. need financial upgrade strengthen cooperation east asia without financial stability development, unreasonable look continuous growth real economy. example spring readily mind. the korean economy, long maintain rapid growth pace, hit foreign currency crisis deep recession end 1997. the accumulate structural fragility financial sector reveal once. for part, japan endure long recession 10 year bubble burst early 1990s. in east asia, along brisk growth real economy, financial demand also increase sharply, connection trade, foreign direct indirect investment, operation foreign reserves. look trade, volume japan, china korea build rapidly 96 billion dollar 1990 378 billion dollar 2002. the regional financial demand accompany trade flow see explosive growth. nevertheless, fragility regional financial structures, u.s & european-based investment bank meet large part regional financial demand advance financial system accumulate expertise. this east asian country must cure fragility financial sector strengthen financial cooperation within area. notably east asian financial market relatively narrow easily liable attack large flow speculative capital. bad still, progress financial liberalization openness, financial unstability one country spread instantaneously associate countries. in light situation, close financial cooperation urgent ever. encouragingly several step already take strengthen regional financial cooperation. in may 2000, member asean+3 opt chiang mai initiative. this base provision bilateral liquidity support arrangement currency swap central bank involved. the bank korea regular conference matter mutual interest bank japan people’s bank china. beside this, open beijing representative office last november view intensify cooperation. these steps, i think, beginning. it absolutely vital continue expand financial cooperation throughout region. close remark give increase necessity financial cooperation among regional countries, korea, china japan recognize build east asian financial hub core task economic development. there rivalry among build countries. such competition, however, mean exclusion others. rather competition good faith provide opportunity financial market country overcome structural fragility, develop together. in way it, fact, promote mutual cooperation. your conference offer valuable chance respect expand financial cooperation widen breath mutual understand share idea opinion among experts. my especial hope find basis specific practical initiative deep wide-ranging discussion east asian monetary integration development asian bond markets, matter focus intense debate days. fruitful outcome conference great boost financial economists. more practically immense help administrative authority like governments, central banks, 2 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 3 financial supervisory institution financial player like banks, insurer security companies. in respect i great anticipation conference. alan greenspan: economic outlook current fiscal issue testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system committee budget, u house representatives, 25 february 2004. * * * mr. chairman member committee, i please today offer view outlook economy current fiscal issues. i want emphasize i speak necessarily federal reserve. a know, u.s. economy appear make transition period subpar growth one vigorous expansion. real gross domestic product (gdp) rise briskly second half last year, fuel sizable increase household spending, notable strengthen business investment, sharp rebound exports. moreover, productivity surged, price remain stable, financial condition improve further. overall, economy lately make impressive gain output real incomes, although progress create job limited. the recent indicator suggest economy strong start 2004, prospect sustain expansion period ahead good. the mark improvement financial situation many household business recent year bolster aggregate demand. and short-term real interest rate close zero, monetary policy remain highly accommodative. also, impetus fiscal policy appear likely stay expansionary year. at time, increase efficiency significant level underutilized resource help keep lid inflation. this favorable short-term outlook u.s. economy, however, play backdrop grow concern prospect federal budget. a well aware, run surplus brief period around turn decade, federal budget revert deficit. the unify deficit swell $375 billion fiscal 2003 appear continue widen current fiscal year. accord late projection administration congressional budget office (cbo), current policy remain place, budget stay deficit time. in part, recent deficit result economic downturn 2001 period slow growth followed, well sharp decline equity prices. the deficit also reflect significant step-up spend defense high outlay homeland security many nondefense discretionary programs. tax reduction - intend specifically provide stimulus economy - also contribute deterioration fiscal balance. for time, fiscal stimulus associate large deficit helpful shore weak economy. during next years, deficit tend narrow somewhat economic expansion proceed rise income generate increase revenues. moreover, current ramp-up defense spend continue indefinitely. merely maintain give military commitment, rather add it, remove important factor drive deficit higher. but ratio federal debt hold public gdp already stop fall even edge past couple year - imply worsen start point policymakers address adverse budgetary implication age population rise health care costs. for decade, rule lay budget enforcement act 1990, late modification extension act, provide procedural framework help congress make difficult decision require forge good fiscal balance. however, brief emergence surplus erode adhere rules, many provision help restrain budgetary decisionmaking 1990s - particular, limit discretionary spend paygo requirement - violate frequently eventually allow expire. in recent years, budget debate turn choice offer advocate tax cut advocate increase spending. to date, action would low forthcoming deficit receive narrow support, many analyst become increasingly concern that, without restoration budget enforcement mechanism fundamental political signal, inbuilt political bias favor red ink become entrenched. in 2008 - four year - first cohort baby-boom generation reach 62, early age social security retirement benefit may claim age half prospective beneficiary choose retire; 2011, individual reach 65 thus bi review 13/2004 1 eligible medicare. at time, intermediate assumption oasdi trustees, still three cover worker oasdi beneficiary; 2025, ratio project 2-1/4. this dramatic demographic change certain place enormous demand nation’s resource - demand almost surely unable meet unless action taken. for variety reasons, action good take soon possible. the budget scenario consider cbo december assessment long-term budget outlook offer vivid - sober - illustration challenge face prepare retirement baby-boom generation. these scenario suggest that, range reasonably plausible assumption spend taxes, could situation decade ahead rapid increase unify budget deficit set motion dynamic large deficit result ever-growing interest payment augment deficit future years. the result rise federal debt could drain fund away private capital formation thus time slow growth live standards. favorable productivity developments, course, help alleviate impend budgetary strains, one expect productivity growth sufficient bail u out. indeed, productivity would grow rate far historical average fully resolve long-term finance problem social security medicare. high productivity, course, buoy expect revenue system, also raise social security obligations.1 moreover, although productivity direct link medicare spending, historical experience suggest demand medical service increase real income, time rise line productivity. today, federal outlay social security medicare amount le 7 percent gdp. in december, cbo project outlay would increase 12 percent gdp 2030 current law, use assumption growth health-care cost similar intermediate assumption medicare trustees; spend medicaid add in, rise ratio even steeper. to sure, rise outlay relative gdp could finance tax increases, cbo result suggest that, even non-interest spend constrain fairly tightly, ensure fiscal stability would require overall federal tax burden well long-term average. most expert believe best baseline plan purpose assume demographic shift associate retirement baby-boom generation permanent - is, reverse cohort pass away. indeed, long longevity continue increase - assume significant change immigration fertility rate - proportion elderly population rise. if fundamental change age distribution materializes, eventually choice make significant structural adjustment major retirement programs. one change congress could consider move forward critical issue replace current measure “cost living” use many purpose respect revenue outlay appropriate price index. a may aware, 2002, bureau labor statistic introduce new price index - chain consumer price index (cpi). the new index base underlie individual price official cpi. but combine price remove inadvertent bias official price index, thus good measure change cost living, statutory intent indexing.2 all else equal, chain cpi use index past decade, cumulative unify budget deficit thus level federal debt would reduce $200 billion; high receipt reduction debt service associate high receipt account roughly 60 percent saving, remainder attributable low outlays. shift chain-weighted measure would address perhaps fundamental shortcoming cpi - notably question whether quality improvement adequately capture - would important step toward good implementation intention congress. 1 under current law, fast productivity growth would affect individual already retire benefit index consumer price index (cpi). however, would raise initial benefit future retiree effect real wage time. in end, productivity would rise 3-1/2 percent per year, 2 percentage point per year fast trustees’ current intermediate assumption, eliminate social security imbalance seventy-five years; productivity growth would even rapid achieve balance perpetuity. 2 in particular, chain cpi capture fully official cpi way consumer alter mix expenditure response change relative prices. 2 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 3 another possible adjustment relate age social security medicare benefit provided. under current law, even so-called normal retirement age social security slat move 67 next two decades, ratio number year typical worker spend retirement number year work rise long term. a critical step forward would adjust system ratio stabilizes. a number specific approach propose implement indexation, principle behind insulate finance system, least degree, change life expectancy. sound private public decisionmaking aid determine ahead fact one source risk, namely demographic developments, deal with. the degree uncertainty whether future resource adequate meet current statutory obligation come generation retiree daunting. the concern much social security, benefit tie mechanical fashion retirees’ wage history useful tool forecast future outlays. the outlook medicare, however, much difficult assess. although forecast number program beneficiary reasonably straightforward, know little rapidly medical technology continue advance innovation translate future spending. to sure, technological innovation greatly improve quality medical care can, theory, reduce cost exist treatments. but medical technology expand range treatment options, also potential add overall spend - cases, significantly. a result, range possible outlay per recipient extremely wide. this uncertainty important reason cautious - especially give government programs, whether spend tax preferences, easy initiate extraordinarily difficult shut constituency develop. in view upward ratchet government program enormous uncertainty upper bind future demand medical care, i believe thorough review spend commitment - least adjustment commitment - necessary prudent policy. i also believe obligation near retirement honor promise them. if change need made, make soon enough future retiree time adjust plan retirement spend make sure personal resources, along expect receive government, sufficient meet retirement needs. i certainly agree scrutiny need apply taxes. however, tax rate increase sufficient dimension deal loom fiscal problem arguably pose significant risk economic growth revenue base. the exact magnitude risk difficult estimate, enough concern, judgment, warrant aim close fiscal gap primarily, wholly, outlay side. the dimension challenge enormous. the one certainty resolution situation require difficult choice future performance economy depend choices. no change easy, involve low claim resource raise financial obligations. it fall congress determine best address compete claims. in so, need consider distributional effect policy change also broad economic effect labor supply, retirement behavior, private saving. history show that, face major challenges, elect official rise occasion. in particular, past twenty year so, prospect large deficit generally lead action narrow them. i trust recent deterioration budget outlook fast-approaching retirement baby-boom generation meet similar determination effectiveness. t t mboweni: the monetary policy framework south africa address mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, international investor conference, sun city, 24 march 2004. * * * 1. introduction the main task macro-economic policy promotion sustainable high economic growth, creation employment opportunities, containment inflation, improvement live condition resident country, elimination unjustifiable discrepancy distribution income amongst people. these economic objective best obtain amongst thing stable financial environment. financial instability major obstacle fulfilment task. stable financial condition maintain throughout various phase business cycle attain maximum economic development. 2. primary objective monetary policy the role south african reserve bank (sarb) process achieve maintain price stability develop supervise healthy bank sector. this objective spell constitution south africa sarb act. in section 224 constitution section 3 sarb act state primary objective bank protect value currency republic interest balance sustainable economic growth. this, view, mean price stability. these law therefore recognise protect currency balance sustainable economic growth achieved. it believe bank, indeed central bank rest world, potential growth rate economy optimum creation employment opportunity attain stable financial conditions. by fulfil primary objective, sarb make contribution sustainable high economic growth south africa. section 224(2) constitution determine sarb, pursuit primary objective, must perform function independently without fear, favour prejudice. regular consultation must, however, take place minister finance governor sarb. in addition legal requirement, section 10(2) sarb act clearly state “the rate bank discount rediscount various class bills, promissory note security shall determine announce bank time time”. this give bank right determine official rate, call repo rate. these law therefore provide executive management bank complete instrumental independence, one precondition regular consultation take place minister finance. the bank accordingly perform work autonomous manner. have establish task bank achievement maintenance price stability, term price stability convey? in economic literature price stability normally regard situation wherein change general price level materially affect economic decision-making process. although relative price movement still impact production, consumption investment, rate inflation condition long important factor decision take producers, consumer investors. price stability heavily dependent stability financial sector. the bank accordingly also task promote soundness management domestic bank effective application international best practise regulatory supervisory area. the objective bank supervision ensure bank manage risk way systemic risk bank sector minimised, thereby ensure safety depositor’s money. it aim promote financial soundness bank bank system whole. in fulfilment mission bank perform virtually full range function duty customarily carry central banks. the main function bank are: 1) issue banknote coin; 2) act banker government; bi review 18/2004 1 3) act bank private banks; 4) provide facility clear settlement claim banks; 5) provide liquidity bank act case case basis “lender last resort”; 6) engage open-market operations; 7) collecting, process interpret economic statistic information. 3. the importance price stability the objective achieve maintain price stability base proposition inflation bad economic growth, employment creation distribution income. be indeed case, growth attain allow acceleration inflation? it often argue trade-off inflation growth base philips-curve analysis. in analysis argue low level inflation real economic growth stimulate expansionary monetary policy even policy lead high inflation. there may truth analysis short term, policy achieve long-term sustainable high economic growth employment creation. an artificial stimulation demand inevitably result high inflation rather production long term. if demand allow grow rapidly production capacity economy, lead inflation. it also result rise deficit current account balance payment. if deficit readily finance mean financial inflows, exchange rate currency could come pressure. a depreciate currency bring forth pressure domestic prices. a little bite inflation start easily gain momentum, could require restrictive measure attain balance demand supply. substantial swing interest rate achieve balance make business plan difficult could lead low average economic growth long term. the maintenance price stability long term imply low stable interest rates. with low inflation, output increase become dependent increase investment quantity quality labour, way production factor employed. economic growth become propel healthy permanent factor dependent artificial stimulation demand. low inflation therefore important factor sustainable high growth. in stable environment demand output grow steady sustainable basis. if price stability achieved, well know disadvantage inflation come play. high inflation distort allocation resource favour investment non-productive hedge asset rather capital formation. high inflation discourage save lead consumption. high inflation erode competitiveness local manufacturer producer vis-à-vis foreign producers. high inflation lead unfair redistribution wealth penalise poor rich. the general conclusion accordingly high inflation medium long term lead low growth, few jobs, unemployment unequal distribution income wealth. 4. inflation target how achieve price stability? inflation monetary phenomenon, i.e. inflation cannot take place without rapid increase quantity money output, provide velocity circulation money remain unchanged. a mervyn king, governor bank england, coin it: “no money, inflation.” an increase inflation rate originate many development international domestic economy impossible individual institution prevent cause inflation take effect. the sarb use power disposal reduce inflationary pressures. this consist basically influence liquidity bank sector and/or influence general level interest rates. in pursue price stability, main operational variable bank us influence price repo rate, interest rate sarb meet liquidity need bank institutions. by change repo rate, bank directly affect domestic interest rates, demand money credit, eventually change prices. from february 2000 change repo rate base inflation target monetary policy framework. with adoption framework, bank move away eclectic monetary 2 bi review 18/2004 policy framework informal inflation targeting. in eclectic monetary policy framework growth money supply bank credit extension use intermediate guideline determination short-term interest rates. in addition, decide appropriate monetary policy stance, development number variable also take consideration, monetary aggregate lose usefulness indicator future inflation due structural change economy. the adoption inflation target framework reduce role intermediate guidelines. instead, sarb adopt strategy determine directly likely path inflation would be. this lead detail assessment factor could affect inflation base past experience. the indicator sarb monitor include growth money supply bank credit extension, change nominal real salary wages, nominal unit labour costs, gap potential actual domestic output, exchange rate developments, producer price import prices. development number exogenous factor also regard important analysis, oil prices, food price administer prices. unfortunately bank little control exogenous price changes, may important bear inflationary pressures. in analyse factor sarb acutely aware long variable lag effect interest rate change inflation. this generally believe 18 24 months. these lag monetary policy important consideration decision determine directly likely path inflation be. in adopt inflation target framework bank’s research become increasingly focus transmission mechanism monetary policy south africa development inflation forecast models. in co-operation staff central bank suite model developed, comprise core model, small-scale model, vector models, philips-curve model indicator models. the prediction inflation utmost importance implementation monetary policy change policy measure must always base likely future price developments. the fact inflation target rely forecast lead criticism weakness framework forecast inherently unreliable. this limitation, however, apply case monetary policy frameworks. if objective central bank attainment price stability, always take view current policy stance affect future price developments, whichever monetary policy framework decide pursue. the difference inflation target monetary policy frameworks, inflation target make forecast explicit transparent. although forecast inflation important tool decide appropriate monetary policy stance, sarb still apply discretion reach decision. every forecast base assumption model perfect. a careful analysis economic data risk involve make ensure correct decision taken. for reason central bank also apply suite model minimise risk possible limitation individual models. this analysis current possible future development important achievement target override objective monetary policy inflation target monetary policy framework. such framework successful public convince central bank serious achievement target. miss target wide margin consistently lead lose prestige credibility central bank. the sarb also realise exclusive emphasis inflation goal short term could lead highly unstable real economy long term. if severe exogenous shock affect economy, extreme measure reach inflation target could costly term lose output employment. in cases, discretion apply bank. the monetary policy framework first make allowance occurrence include escape clause stipulate circumstance bank need meet target. experience show escape clause create problem communicate monetary policy decisions. it accordingly replace november 2003 introduction “explanation clause”. in case supply shock bank must fully inform public nature shock, anticipate impact inflation monetary policy response ensure inflation return target. 5. the institutional arrangement the decision appropriate monetary policy stance take monetary policy committee (mpc). this committee set shortly south africa adopt inflation target bi review 18/2004 3 framework monetary policy. it first meet 13 october 1999. the committee present consist governor, three deputy governor four senior official bank. six meet hold year interval two month meeting. these meet normally hold two days. on first day member bank’s staff inform committee international domestic economic development present forecast likely future developments. on second day decision take monetary policy stance statement explain decision finalised. this statement release press conference broadcast live sabc tv. this process improve transparency monetary policy considerably. in order develop good understand monetary policy, monetary policy forum convene bank. these forum provide mean open discussion monetary policy recent international domestic economic developments. the monetary policy forum hold twice year major centre south africa representative labour organisations, business, community academic institution invite attend them. the forum ensure view interest party take account determination monetary policy monetary policy stance explain detail public. in addition, bank publish monetary policy review twice year increase understand conduct monetary policy. the first review publish march 2001. in review detail analysis make domestic international economic development way inflation could affected. the sarb’s core forecast inflation also publish review form fan chart. confidence band fan chart show vary degree certainty project rate increase general price level. 6. assessment inflation target south africa the inflation target originally specify average annual rate increase 3 6 per cent consumer price index metropolitan urban area exclude mortgage interest cost (the cpix) year 2002 2003. in november 2003 decide terminate annual average specification complicate implementation inflation target framework could lead inconsistency monetary policy arise excessive interest rate volatility ineffective management inflation expectations. it replace continuous target 3 6 per cent period beyond 2006. in words, target specify inflation rate 3 6 per cent must obtain continuously twelve-month period come years. in 2002 rate increase cpix average 10 per cent, 4 percentage point upper limit target range. four exogenous factor mainly responsible inflation outcome. firstly, nominal value rand trade-weighted basis decline approximately 34 per cent end june 2001 end year. secondly, price food increase almost 17 per cent 2002. thirdly, brent price oil rise us$20 per barrel february 2002 us$28 per barrel december 2002. fourthly, administer price increase high rate 10 per cent 2002. in view effect extraordinary event inflation, monetary policy committee opt bring inflation rate target level gradual manner. in january 2002 first corrective step taken. at meet committee increase repo rate 100 basis points, follow three increase 100 basis point next three meetings. this bring repurchase rate 13,5 per cent september 2002, level rate keep june 2003. these corrective measure desire result. the twelve-month rate increase cpix slow 11,3 per cent november 2002, move 6 per cent upper limit inflation target range 5,4 per cent september 2003. cpix inflation decelerate year-on-year rate 4,0 per cent december 2003, increase marginally 4,2 per cent january 2004. for year 2003 whole cpix inflation average 6,8 per cent. these development allow sarb reduce repo rate 5,5 percentage point second half 2003. in bring cpix inflation low levels, restrictive monetary policy stance assist number factors. particularly important regard discipline government finance help considerably reduce inflation expectations. the monetary policy 4 bi review 18/2004 stance assist recovery exchange rate rand begin 2002 slow rate increase food energy prices. it nevertheless state consistent application inflation target monetary policy framework successful bring inflation target range define government. moreover, inflation outlook remain favourable. most analyst economic commentators, include sarb, expect cpix inflation remain within inflation target range next two years. inflation project accelerate moderately course 2004 level close upper limit inflation target, follow somewhat slow rate increase 2005. this improve inflation performance accompany pick-up economic growth 2004 2005. the inflation target monetary policy framework assist bank bring good inflation performance, also strengthen sarb’s mandate focus price stability. in previous policy regime explicit benchmark performance bank could judge objectively. in inflation target framework, specific target range set price index achieve specific time frame, subject structural reform economy. a already indicated, inflation target also accompany major improvement bank’s communication public, make monetary policy transparent. by specification target range, accountability monetary policy improved. the fact government decide level target range improve co-ordination monetary policy economic policy measures. to extent, inflation target already lead weaken importance backward-looking inflation decision-making business labour. however, many wage demand still base historic inflation figures. it nevertheless state introduction inflation target south africa big success. 7. improvement international liquidity position before conclude address inflation-targeting monetary policy framework south africa, i would also like mention application framework accompany consistent effort improve liquidity management south african sarb. at end september 1998 net open foreign-currency position sarb (nofp) still amount us$23,2 billion, i.e. difference oversold forward book us$25,3 billion net gold foreign exchange reserve us$2,1 billion. at stage decision take reduce nofp gradually zero. underlie circumstance allow bank reduce position relatively rapidly us$9,5 billion end december 2000. then gradual approach adopt due weakness external value rand. use proceed privatisation fund raise abroad government, nofp bring us$4,8 billion end 2001. in may 2003 oversold nofp finally convert overbought position us$0,7 billion. with expunction oversold nofp, sarb shift focus reduce oversold forward book seek time strengthen official foreign exchange reserve position. the oversold forward book bank amount us$4,7 billion time. this oversold forward book close february 2004. at end february 2004, international liquidity position bank positive us$4,7 billion. although probably still relatively low relation significant peers, achievement positive balance major accomplishment. the sarb’s focus come year increase position gradually high levels. 8. conclusion these improvement international liquidity position low rate inflation provide platform rapid economic development south africa. stability interest rate value rand important pre-conditions attainment high economic growth employment creation. the focus sarb therefore continue objective price stability. we develop environment favour price stability way contribute attainment important objective economic policy. welcome south africa. welcome north west province south africa. enjoy! bi review 18/2004 5 thank much. 6 bi review 18/2004 birgir isleifur gunnarsson: review economic financial development iceland 2003 address mr birgir isleifur gunnarsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, bank's annual meeting, reykjavík, 23 march 2004. * * * on behalf board governor central bank iceland i welcome bank’s 43rd annual meeting. the bank’s financial statement year 2003 ratify today prime minister. the bank’s annual report also published. it include survey bank’s activity performance, along detail report bank’s monetary policy actions, financial system, financial stability financial markets, main feature economic development course last year. price development three year pass since iceland’s monetary policy framework change formal inflation target adopt joint declaration government central bank. under framework, target monetary policy price stability. the central bank oblige aim average rate inflation, measure annual 12-month increase cpi, close 2½% possible. since monetary policy aim maintain price stability, apply achieve economic target balance current account high level employment, except insofar compatible bank’s inflation target. price stable 2003. over year, i.e. begin january 2003 correspond period 2004, inflation measure 2.4%. this target. exclude change price public services, rate inflation somewhat lower. until close month 2003, good price somewhat low previous year, increase price service slow significantly. substantial increase see house prices, however, house component consumer price index rise much cpi whole. house inflation begin inch downwards course year development continue far year. the central bank thus feel satisfy rate inflation recent term, bear mind long lag transmission mechanism, price development indicate monetary policy precede period intend effect. the central bank low policy interest rate 5.3% begin february 2003. it inflation forecast warrant change policy rate bank. the policy rate broadly neutral year, i.e. neither stimulate dampen demand. in real term policy rate therefore far estimate equilibrium real interest rate year. output growth iceland experience robust output growth 1996 2002, marginally negative. output growth recover last year. late estimate statistic iceland put figure 4%, somewhat high central bank assume update macroeconomic forecast publish early month. statistical evaluation output growth 2003 could still change estimate revised, illustrate uncertainty surround recent current economic development compound uncertainty future monetary policy formulation always faces. be may, output growth clearly robust explain rapid increase national expenditure two year contraction. private consumption growth also pick investment soar sharp recession, primarily due impact hydropower aluminium project launch year, along investment housing. an interest comparison make output growth iceland countries, especially euro area often use frame reference. roughly speaking, 1996 2001 growth iceland two three time high euro area. in 2002 euro area perform better, 2003 growth estimate 0.8% euro area 4% iceland. the difference even pronounce iceland large euro countries, germany, france italy, whose economy sluggish several years. this large bi review 18/2004 1 difference growth explain much interest-rate differential prevail iceland area. in part policy stance european central bank extent possible guide effort drive growth low interest rates, central bank iceland’s objective large contain economic overheating. the current account deficit labour market iceland’s external balance volatile recent years. a current account deficit equivalent 10% gdp 2000 virtually eliminate within two years, widen sharply 2003. after reasonable balance first quarter sizeable merchandise account surplus, deficit second third quarter large since begin 2001. for year whole, current account deficit equivalent 5½% gdp. a recession export strong contribute factor, along rise import drive private consumption, much widen current account deficit may ascribe import investment good hydropower project. in respect deficit benign origin, although pace increase early upswing cause concern. a commonly case onset growth episode, increase demand labour fairly slow year. the unemployment rate come slowly widely expect give surge vacancy register employment agencies. seasonally adjust unemployment begin decline slowly autumn onwards. on hand, number vacancy double last year demand foreign labour pick year wear on. in february 2004, seasonally adjust unemployment 2.9% go 0.1% per month since september 2003. productivity growth appear exceptionally high last year. a recent years, domestic wage rise outstrip among iceland’s main trade partner countries. measure wage index, domestic wage rise 5½% 2003, represent 3½% growth real terms. exchange rate development foreign reserve under new monetary framework, iceland abandon fix exchange rate regime króna float market. every often argument put forward central bank determine exchange rate, people criticise exchange rate develop along different line expected. such debate far le prominent 2003 year before, definitely indicate grow awareness central bank cannot exert decisive impact exchange rate króna. for first part year króna strengthened, probably result expectation currency inflow connection investment hydropower aluminium. around middle year króna depreciate again. uncertainty revenue keflavík nato base norðurál aluminium smelter expansion, perhaps extent stepped-up central bank currency purchases, probable explanations. around time, currency inflow diminish connection credit movements. the króna begin appreciate september, around time report norðurál expansion look likely go ahead le uncertainty operation nato base. currency inflow outflow fairly good balance last month 2003 exchange rate settle down. towards end year króna begin strengthen again, mid-january. the main explanation appreciation probably inflow borrow fund connection series business merger takeovers. change exchange rate króna need examine context slide u dollar euro. one consequence exchange rate króna euro roughly two year ago, dollar weaken króna one-third period. by law, one task central bank iceland maintain foreign exchange reserve accordance objective role. at end 2001 foreign reserve largely sustain foreign borrow central bank, leave external position unacceptably low long-term view. the reason fix exchange rate regime, central bank frequently intervene fx market 2000 2001 sell foreign currency effort stem slide króna. in 2002 central bank begin build foreign reserve again, purchase foreign currency equivalent 4.5 b.kr. last year bank step purchase equivalent 43.2 b.kr. nonetheless, bank’s purchase amount 3.6% 2 bi review 18/2004 total turnover fx market year. by mid-2003 central bank repay foreign short-term borrow full end year foreign reserve amount 58 b.kr. this year bank continue purchase currency market, small scale 2003. it thereby aim strengthen foreign reserve even year. ample foreign reserve obvious prudential measure one factor international rat agency consider evaluate creditworthiness iceland’s sovereign corporate debt. however, high level reserve leave central bank’s operation much expose change exchange rate, reflect minor operate loss report last year, describe early meeting. financial stability the central bank oblige law promote price stability also efficient safe financial system, include payment system domestically foreign countries. in country main objective central banks. this role important shock bank financial system closely link change value financial assets, interest rate exchange rate. the central bank’s monetary policy measure information system enable evaluate risk financial shock warn them. the central bank publish two report financial stability monetary bulletin last year, may november. the broad find position financial system strengthen year, new report publish last week indicate position major financial company market relatively firm. macroeconomic condition favourable whole. the main concern expansion largely foreign-financed lending, high asset prices. there noteworthy flurry leverage buyout list unlisted companies, provide one explanation surge lend banks. these transaction drive equity price several list companies, include financial companies, prompt question impact share price head back down. house price real term stop climb great reykjavík area, time least, substantial drop unlikely near future. asset price development important factor financial stability assessment may also influence monetary developments, especially economic climate present. a decline equity house price could

investment boom. lend development a i mention before, lend growth cause concern, financial stability central bank’s inflation target. domestic lend grow brisk pace 2003 development appear head direction year. total domestic lend deposit money bank twelve month end january increase 23%, rate consistent longterm price stability economic stability. the period 1998 2001 provide recent example consequence heavy credit growth. both arrears loan loss rise wake credit boom, lead temporary tighten commercial banks’ save banks’ foreign funding. while recession ensue strain financial system over, partly ascribe relatively favourable economic condition consequently sharp turnaround exchange rate króna financial company sustain minor setbacks. proportionally, high growth deposit money banks’ lend foreign borrowers, foreign currency-denominated lend domestic entity also surged, 45% past 12 months. by mean foreign currencydenominated credit provide domestic business household foreign currency income hedge exchange risk. this pose particular risk borrower lender alike. foreign debt deposit money bank end january 2004 rise year-on-year almost 300 b.kr., two-thirds. there probably number explanation strong demand foreign borrowing. firstly, connect change icelandic business structure ownership. follow privatisation state banks, investor actively involve dissolve old link business ownership forge new ones. foreign funding, mediate banks, play key role events. secondly, condition international finance market bi review 18/2004 3 favourable reshuffling. foreign short-term

next years. in december last year central bank send letter chief executive commercial bank large save bank express concern rapid increase lend high level foreign short-term financing. a generally case people respond different ways, point finger elsewhere. an encourage aspect subsequent developments, however, bank begin extend maturity foreign borrowing, gap short-term long-term liability narrow recent weeks. this crucial, may imprudent place excessive faith availability shortterm funding. in letter, central bank echo cautionary remark agency award credit rat republic iceland icelandic borrower foreign markets. rat agency state chief concern main constraint upgrade icelandic rat - even potential reason downgrade - high external debt position economy. since treasury retire foreign debt past years, rat agencies’ comment address elsewhere, particular banks. cautionary remark base argument course heed bank iceland borrow abroad recently. it everyone’s interest safeguard iceland’s credit rat and, possible, strengthen them. payment settlement system at central bank’s annual meet recent year i outline work undertake development payment settlement systems. two type payment system operation iceland, settlement systems, i.e. central bank’s real-time gross settlement system net system operate fjölgreiðslumiðlun hf. settlement security transaction process former system.

principle systemically important payment systems. this work focus clarify qualification responsibility management net system participants. settlement process review respect finality payment time

year system designate notify efta surveillance authority. the real-time gross settlement system net system thereby recognise legitimate payment system iceland across european economic area. also 2003, central bank fme [financial supervisory authority] sign cooperation agreement oversight prudential supervision payment settlement systems. i would like express special thank good cooperation party involve important issues. even though important milestone attained, sound operation payment system remain important extensive task. a multicurrency country? every often question crop whether iceland destine become sometimes call multicurrency country. this apparently refer large share business transaction conduct one currency liability various kind mostly denominate foreign currencies. indication cite include performance-related wage fishery sector, represent indirect indexation wage exchange rate; increase trend corporate account conduct foreign currencies; 4 bi review 18/2004 fact recently even household offer foreign currency-denominated loans. other factor mention great globalisation, grow importance external trade, foreign investment. there tendency paint rather exaggerate picture iceland’s dependence global trade. admittedly, foreign trade increase, still quite small relative size economy. direct foreign investment proportionally much low advance economies, scope foreign indirect investment similar neighbour countries. foreign currency deposit establish feature bank system iceland. they well within reference limit imf, example, apply classify country accord whether use foreign currency important not. account foreign currency confine handful company multinational operation generally speak króna overwhelmingly predominant. however, true among advance economies, iceland one high level external debt exchangerate sensitivity. bear mind, hardly question solid position króna icelandic economy. nothing give u reason expect change. a country earn considerable revenue tourism, foreign currency always use extent, probably much common practice country long border currency areas, canada switzerland. it seem highly unlikely króna’s position trade currency would severely undermine currency would prefer domestic transactions. continual movement exchange rate króna would create broad risk use currencies, unless liability - include wage settlement - convert foreign currency virtually time. because economical business transaction liability denominate far possible currency, fundamental change position króna unlikely, except directly act government, indirectly highly improbable event economic policy collapse erode confidence króna, accompany hyperinflation, happen latin american country adopt dollar others force adopt another currency. it sometimes claim heavy level external debt mean interest rate decision european central bank possibly even impact iceland domestic monetary policy. there nothing new impact foreign interest rate development felt iceland - apply country well - although scale iceland’s foreign debt leaf economy susceptible foreign interest rate movements. it worth remember foreign interest rate development mostly affect iceland’s national income, economic cycle current account balance, never crucial impact domestic rate inflation. a heavy weight foreign currency-denominated borrow domestic debt may complicate transmission mechanism monetary policy. in long run, however, domestic monetary policy measure determine deteriorate value domestic currency vis-à-vis good service - put plainly, inflation. prospect finally, i shall turn economic monetary prospects. last week central bank publish quarterly monetary bulletin, include update macroeconomic inflation forecast. this comprehensive new forecast, henceforth schedule publish twice year, june december. inflation forecast remain target second half 2005. around time expect rise target, assumption exchange rate central bank’s policy interest rate remain unchanged. in assess price development inflation outlook important bear mind recent strength króna probably unsustainable long run. recent price development forecast base assumption króna remain strong may therefore underestimate latent inflationary pressures. capital inflow next two year may bolster króna, cannot take grant give condition could change. a sizeable increase productivity last year appear contribute recent low rate inflation, despite high output growth 2003 forecast november. if productivity continue grow unusually brisk pace, ease inflationary pressure near term. the recently conclude wage settlements, broadly speak seem copatible inflation target, include provision could induce great efficiency business operation boost productivity. another recent factor serve ease inflationary pressure rapid growth national expenditure bi review 18/2004 5 primarily channel increase imports. it therefore exert le pressure domestic factor production otherwise, reflect widen current account deficit, i discussed. in long run, excessive current account deficit could undermine exchange rate fuel inflation, although appear much threat within horizon late forecast. the bank’s macroeconomic forecast assume norðurál aluminium smelter expansion go ahead, raise project output growth 3½% 2004 4½% 2005. the appreciation króna, strong increase productivity 2003 large share foreign labour employ hydropower aluminium project result le pressure domestic factor production price would otherwise case. a i mention earlier, likely appreciation króna first half last year connect plan investment aluminium hydropower projects. have plan materialised, almost certain central bank’s policy rate would low today. due strengthen króna 2003 propose tighten fiscal stance imply budget year, central bank’s policy interest rate remain unchanged since february last year. the central bank consider grind raise policy rate yet, thing equal inflation forecast call high policy rate come months, even though inflation outlook favourable time next year. because monetary policy need forward-looking, could well mean central bank raise interest rate even though inflation still target. largescale investment next year mean monetary decision need take account long horizon usual. consideration financial stability call approach. lady gentlemen: inflation forecast play key role central bank’s monetary policy decisions. look future always difficult, i think central bank feel satisfy accurate inflation forecast turn be. i would like conclude thank office prime minister government authority pleasant cooperation. i also thank financial institution good collaboration. last least, i would like thank employee central bank fine work, without bank could achieve impressive results. 6 bi review 18/2004 malcolm d knight: the financial system global recovery - lie ahead? speech mr malcolm d knight, general manager bank international settlements, annual congress swiss society economics statistic “international money finance”, basel, 18 march 2004. * * * thank opportunity address plenary session society. since bank international settlement international financial institution base switzerland, key importance u maintain close tie community professional economist country. indeed, fundamental raison d’etre bi closely align subject matter conference - international money finance. the overarch goal bi promote twin objective sustainable non-inflationary economic growth financial stability. a result, analyse current economic picture prospect period ahead, well assess possible challenge financial stability, key element work bis. i want cover area talk morning. in particular, i want outline i see current issue international financial stability touch role bi meet challenges. * * * the economic picture brighten significantly past six months. a strong broad-based global recovery way. china become second engine global growth alongside unite state - buoyancy evident throughout asia. at present, consumer spend europe still lags, sign confidence strengthened. there indication generalise inflationary pressures, even recent surge commodity price raise questions. the international financial system recover series shock - collapse it sector equity bubble, global recession, financial crisis argentina, demise corporation like enron, worldcom parmalat. global equity price well low point reach year ago. interest rate historically low across whole maturity range. credit spread tight, many corporate emerge market sovereign borrower take advantage unusually favourable fund conditions. financial institution generally much good shape year ago. bank many jurisdiction reduce non-performing loans, insurance company benefit rise equity prices. what concern apparently benign environment? the thread argument follows: • global growth present drive three powerful forces: (1) expansionary fiscal policy countries, notably course unite states; (2) accommodative monetary policy almost around globe; (3) investment boom china almost literally without precedent. • expansionary macroeconomic policy will, point, rein in. • investment china - credit expansion associate - need moderate pace ignite inflationary boom bust. • how adjustment evolve next year major influence global bond markets, asset price financial markets, financial institution throughout world. these financial market effect - main focus today - matter great deal prospect sustain non-inflationary global growth. * * * bi review 17/2004 1 in recent year weak economic growth, fiscal policy several large country provide massive stimulus aggregate demand. the cyclically adjust fiscal balance unite state swing surplus around 1% gdp 2000 deficit 5% gdp year - fiscal boost equivalent 6% gdp. fiscal deficit europe also widened, much le unite states. the deficit japan run 5% gdp since 1998 still high. the current stance fiscal policy cannot sustain indefinitely. the large structural deficit add stock public sector debt which, many cases, already high. a unite states, current policy prospect significant fiscal deficit many years. all even worrisome government industrialise country must confront extraordinary challenge rapidly age population next 15 years. central bank policy interest rate also historically low levels. the decline short-term interest rate particularly dramatic unite states, federal fund rate low 6.5% end 2000 1% present. the ecb european central bank also ease monetary policies, although le aggressively. the bank japan pursue policy zero nominal interest rate past couple years, environment fall output price bank system encumber large stock non-performing loans. historically low central bank policy interest rate suggest need return stage “neutral” set monetary policy. there still considerable slack major economies, suggest imminent need monetary tightening. but rise oil commodity price could suggest emerge inflationary pressures, albeit early stage production chain. this problem now, perhaps, certainly development need watching. a relate issue order slow domestic monetary expansions, asian central bank point need scale back intervention foreign exchange market currently hold appreciation currency u dollar. the investment boom china also raise important issues. the present boom part simply one manifestation little short new industrial revolution. million new worker bring international economy. this promise bring great benefit - could provide sustain boost global growth. but long-term benefit process blind u certain important near-term economic risks. one current breathtaking pace investment china elsewhere asia could inflationary, output bump constraint impose limit local infrastructure, constraint supply raw material non-labour factor production. there currently important sign overheat chinese economy. and also risk overinvestment. the production capacity build sector may never profitable, overhang capacity could blight investment prospect future. a every country, sustainable growth china depend implementation effective macroeconomic prudential policies. how different policy challenge meet important impact growth, inflation, prospect global financial markets. in particular, abrupt revision expectation investor could translate gyration financial markets. it financial system issue i turn. * * * global fix income market likely play pivotal role way global economy evolves. current macroeconomic policy significantly affect bond market conditions, change expectation regard policy could strong impact level volatility long-term interest rates. take example fiscal policies. bond market serve, among things, yardstick fiscal prudence. a result, concern future prospect achieve sustainable fiscal policy point likely reflect high interest rate bond markets. not immediately course - fact, deteriorate fiscal position not, date, lead high long-term interest rates. but risk adverse impact financial market could increase, especially fiscal deficit expect persist period strong growth. monetary policy also face challenge. a global recovery proceeds, policy interest rate need return “normal” levels. there course precise benchmark “normal” level interest rates. assume 2% inflation rate, observer would put “neutral” rate interest unite state around 5% nominal terms. whatever true number natural 2 bi review 17/2004 interest rate, certainly well 1% federal fund rate prevail present. it unusual gap size - associate steeply slop yield curve - persist long. the challenge “exit” current accommodative monetary policy stance without create unnecessary uncertainty generate excessive bond market volatility. equally, intervention asian central bank foreign exchange market generate heavy demand u treasury dollar-denominated products, put downward pressure pivotal market interest rates. a intervention subside current exceptional level - eventually must - market interest rate probably rise. nobody know yet much course - lot depend market ass future inflation risk prospect achieve sustainable fiscal policy demand medium-term conditions. * * * it go almost without say long period low interest rate like one we’ve experience create new type risk financial system. one aspect risk high leverage. there evidence carry-trades indeed rise various player take increase duration risk finance low interest rate short-term liabilities. and long-term interest rate risk-free government bond low, many investors, whether leverage not, increasingly tempt “search yield”. this result large net flow fund risky credits. improve fundamental appear explain part narrow credit spread corporate emerge market government borrowers. one piece evidence suggest market extent drive favourable liquidity condition unusually high correlation price movement across broad range assets. an additional challenge arise wide international imbalance result uneven global growth. the main issue is, course, when, how, historically large u current account deficit - run well $500 billion year - narrow. the downward trend u bond yield past couple month provide indication increase concern among investor present. but strong depreciation u dollar euro several currency past 12 month could indication increase pressure adjust. and increase volatility financial market may well indicate mark degree uncertainty adjustment process might entail. * * * nevertheless, indication key internationally active financial institution generally well place present cope high interest rates. they also good prepare withstand increase volatility financial markets, structural improvement enhance stability financial system. good allocation management financial risk provide buff shocks. let highlight three observation support assessment. first, global financial system absorb massive loss global economic downturn recent years. market-based intermediation improve dispersion financial risks. for example, widely disperse equity hold avoid concentration loss financial sector. moreover, financial institution appear use credit risk transfer market quite effectively manage credit portfolios, diversify risk regionally. this seem contribute good allocation credit risk. second, international financial system already weather sharp rebound bond yield take place june july 2003, without experience systemic problems. admittedly, setback occur low interest rate levels. nevertheless, global financial system exhibit noteworthy capacity cope period extreme volatility. this may reflect improvement risk management. the dynamic increase bond yield last summer similar spring 1994 - episode painful financial sector become standard scenario stress test major financial institution perform check risk management systems. hence bank others able learn past episodes. third, financial institution show great capacity absorb shock past. of course, significant difference performance across major countries. nevertheless, bank system today good capitalise overall time 1990s. this reassure picture mean present situation without risks. it difficult paint much le encourage scenario. for instance, sudden unwind position leverage investor would accentuate volatility, perhaps trigger adjustment bi review 17/2004 3 wide investor community. high interest rate could well undermine present asset valuations. debt service burden household corporation could rise lead deterioration loan quality across financial system. whether scenario plausible depend answer several questions. how far borrower financial institution prepare high interest rates? what would effect sharp, discontinuous adjustment? could phase low interest rate strong liquidity growth create new problem may difficult discern now? these question need keep clearly mind, even one broadly optimistic near-term prospects. * * * these issue underline truly global challenge maintain financial stability, relevance international cooperation among central bank financial supervisors. so let close remark role bi address - course - issue relate financial stability. generally, bi contribute two areas: one exchange information discussion take place among central bank authority responsible financial stability. central bank directly responsible every aspect financial stability, guardian overall soundness national financial systems. they also see lender last resort - whatever mean practice. central bank therefore attach great importance careful monitor various build block financial system. the stand committee expert host bi - basel committee bank supervision, committee global financial system, committee payment settlement system - cover build blocks. and last least, financial stability issue occupy prominent place agenda central bank governor meet every month bis, right basel. the area interest bi comprise effort improve structural resilience financial system. the challenge promote sound risk management practice way ensure financial institution adequately capitalise prudently manage - hind ability pursue opportunity profit responsibly. to achieve goal, bi committee involve formulation various internationally accept code standard financial institution markets. the important initiative regard new basel capital accord, perhaps good know “basel ii”. the accord intend reflect improvement banks’ ability identify risks. it also intend align regulatory capital requirement closely actual degree risk bank face. but equally important, new accord provide incentive bank improve management risks. * * * let conclude. very accommodative macroeconomic policy rise china support global growth. these force point bring onto sustainable path way avoid abrupt change expectation financial markets. the main risk high volatility global bond markets, perhaps “overshooting” bond yields. the chance financial institution absorb high interest rate present good, thank improvement recent year identification management financial risks. the bi play part process. and continue so. ensure monetary financial stability permanent challenge demand policymakers keep eye open risk prepare address them. 4 bi review 17/2004 michael c bonello: central bankers’ view new challenge speech mr michael c bonello, governor central bank malta, conference entitle “the challenge central bank enlarge emu” organise jointly european community study association (ecsa austria), research institute european affair (ief) oesterreichische nationalbank, vienna, 20-21 february 2004. mr bonello panelist discussion regard “central bankers’ view new challenges”. * * * when ten countries, include malta, join european union (eu) 1st may, assume status “member state derogation”, mean exempt strict rule emu. this may seem imply transition emu thereby render easier, careful examination condition attach process reveal policy issue involve anything straightforward. this particularly true small open economy like malta’s macroeconomic policy strongly condition external environment, nevertheless succeed reconcile hard currency peg relative exchange rate stability thirty years. malta population 400,000. it nominal gdp €4.5 billion, le 0.1% eu, translate per caput income around 69% eu average. market services, include tourism finance, account nearly two-fifths gdp, manufacture contribute almost quarter. give size lack natural resources, surprise malta one open economy world, import export almost large gdp. the eu malta’s main trade partner, account two-fifths export two-thirds import 2003. it even important market tourism industry major source capital investment. for malta, therefore, prospect anchor relative safety world’s second large economy use economy’s currency represent considerable advantage. perhaps foremost benefit euro area membership able share credibility europe-wide monetary policy. this mean reduce exchange risk le uncertainty economic operators, also elimination risk premium maltese lira. the result reduction interest rates, moreover, would direct benefit term price competitiveness, would also low currency conversion cost increase price transparency. the euro also act spur integration process eu since know trade investment flow tend increase absence exchange rate volatility, also trade country share common currency much three time high country different currencies. the maltese economy relatively well place secure benefit monetary union. for start, adoption euro involve major regime shift. in fact, since collapse bretton wood system maltese lira peg basket major currencies. since lira devalue once, wake erm crisis 1992. apart episode, currency enjoy relative stability. in past five years, example, fluctuation euro/lira rate move within band 1.4% 3.3% around average rate year. the fact currency peg successfully maintain long - testify underlie upward trend external reserves, today represent nine month import - suggest viable exchange rate regime malta. the choice fix exchange rate intermediate target monetary policy dictate key characteristic economy. first, malta’s size imply price taker cannot hope influence term trade nominal exchange rate movements. in addition, economy’s openness, conduct monetary policy must take exchange rate account. this also mean main cost join euro area - loss monetary policy independence - already largely incur euro carry 70% weight currency basket progressive lift exchange control reduce central bank’s ability set interest rate independently world markets. second, maltese economy already closely integrate euro area. this bear trade patterns, also similarity malta’s sectoral distribution value add employment. our business cycle, too, become increasingly correlate euro area. bi review 16/2004 1 this synchronization likely grow exchange rate volatility decline transaction cost fall and, correlation business cycle indeed endogenous monetary union, trade euro area intensifies. in addition, difference productivity level malta euro area trade good sector appear minor, suggest balassa-samuelson effect unlikely strong. similarity also find financial system. for example, degree financial intermediation malta comparable euro area, long-term interest rate well within maastricht reference value. further evidence economy seem well prepare join monetary union fact nominal wage sufficiently flexible carry burden adjustment implicit fix exchange rate regime. the absence extend period high unemployment face significant adverse development suggest labour market able adjust. indeed, unemployment malta le volatile euro area. the exchange rate peg also valuable nominal anchor, restrain price increases. in fact, inflation average 2.4% past five year (1.3% 2003), indicate considerable measure nominal convergence major trade partners, euro area particular. take together, feature maltese economy suggest likelihood experience asymmetric shock small; lead u believe exchange rate peg provide suitable framework join erm ii country able adopt euro sooner rather later. we also aware, however, peg maintain lira’s passage essentially uncharted territory. professor eichengreen’s word admonition last november’s east-west conference vienna readily come mind, “… prescribe band new eu member extend period bad form macroeconomic malpractice. band fragile difficult manage. their fragility clear europe’s experience 1992.” in order ensure smooth transition towards, erm ii, therefore, necessary convince market erm ii indeed natural culmination lira’s currency basket regime. in regard, give track record assume strong national commitment convergence process, strategy also benefit add credibility prospect support ecb ncbs would confer it. on basis similar considerations, lead credit rat agency conclude erm ii participation rat strength. while believe viable approach euro area membership, clear new, possibly uncomfortable situation cannot rule out. international capital movements, example, may well present challenge monetary policy erm ii phase. while econometric evidence recent experience since liberalization capital control suggest maltese economy already cop successfully significant capital outflows, must nevertheless clear monetary policy stand ready neutralise pressure exchange rate develop. high interest rates, course, would helpful economic activity; could compromise progress towards achievement convergence criteria. successfully manage exchange rate thus major challenge. and one. there others broader, macroeconomic policy level arise tool available economic adjustment limit compare many reform need undertaken. many task accomplished, moreover, subject tight deadlines. a result, tradeoff situation inevitably arise, complicate simultaneous pursuit nominal real convergence. one case public finances. here task achieve convergence economic structure income level without endanger fiscal sustainability. the recent experience exist member state suggest inherent incompatibility two objectives. on one hand, accede country must undertake structural reform necessary create congenial business environment achieve efficient allocation resources, would facilitate implementation single monetary policy. on hand, ensure expenditure associate reform drive fiscal imbalance beyond level sustainable, case consider excessive term stability growth pact (sgp). in malta’s case another factor consider persistent weakness major export market impact growth rate. subdue growth constrain tax base, negative effect employment could generate opposition necessary structural reforms. the pursuit fiscal balance burden co-financing requirement build eu’s 2 bi review 16/2004 fund programmes; demographic trend beyond control policy makers, especially population ageing; implementation acquis-related obligations. i dwell length issue state public finance currently significant impediment malta’s membership euro area. while encourage know able reduce fiscal deficit/gdp ratio 11% 1998 current level around 6%, get maastricht reference value 3% 2006, government plan do, require unrelenting effort great emphasis expenditure-cutting. this taxation level already relatively high economic downturn, also tradeoff involve pursue fiscal consolidation. indeed, government’s resolve trim deficit key determinant degree exchange rate stability possible achieve erm ii. this, turn, depend much economic operators, taxpayer recipient social benefit transfer payment prepare give today exchange sustainable public finance tomorrow. in final analysis, therefore, success euro strategy hinge consensus reach implementation necessary reforms. in context, discussion underway malta council economic social development view reform pension health systems, currently two major source pressure public finances. if social partner indeed take ownership reforms, credibility country’s overall economic strategy considerably enhanced. agreement reform also important erm ii context room manoeuvre available central bank restricted. the imply commitment high degree exchange rate stability - country like malta experience limit day-to-day exchange rate movements, concept stability take specific mean - mean monetary policy cannot use demand management purposes. the onus adjustment must fall fiscal structural policies. the implementation effective policy must also ensure financial market quick spot incoherence country’s exchange rate underlie economic condition. since market behaviour, however, also potential produce volatility degree unwarranted economic fundamentals, exchange rate stability assessment end erm ii phase take appropriate account country-specific circumstances. another precondition maintain exchange rate peg ensure smooth transition euro financial sector stability. in respect, regulatory supervisory framework base best international practice already place malta, legislation incorporate almost feature correspond eu directives. institutional responsibility divide malta financial service authority, responsible regulation supervision banking, insurance investment services; central bank malta, charge ensure financial stability system also responsible domestic payment system. in regard reassure recently conclude imf/world bank fsap exercise find malta’s financial system healthy well supervised, comprehensive legal framework strong adherence international standard codes. an issue special significance central banker need preserve integrity institutions. although experience current euro area member state already provide useful insight appropriate exchange rate strategy pursue prior to, erm ii, accede country arrive judgment basis expectation future path economy. expectations, however, that. this mean stand ready give satisfactory account rationale policy choice made, explain deviation target ensure government introduce corrective measure without undue delay. unfortunately, however, information reach economic operators, financial market particular, always accurate. and yet, month go eu accession, market look indication regard strategy intend pursue respect erm ii entry euro area. it important, therefore, constantly guard imprecise information could provoke untoward market reactions. this highlight importance effective communication strategy appropriate coordination central bank governments. in malta joint work committee establish elaborate strategy adopt euro fulfil role. bi review 16/2004 3 simultaneously need contribute promotion economic convergence within emu parameters, central bank engage task integrate european system central bank (escb). the challenge multifaceted involve infrastructural organisational change profoundly affect central bank financial markets, also player markets. the technical aspect escb membership represent special challenge small accede country like malta. the domestic financial market country small le liquid exist eu members, typically le sophisticated. and yet, upon membership expect function level long-standing and, cases, large member system. ensure transition take place least possible disruption entail comprehensive reform institution operate systems. for example, real time gross settlement payment system (rtgs) put place instead exist

cross-border payment system adapt ensure meet today’s ‘straight processing’ standards. similarly, regard statistic overhaul methodology databases. the development system capable deliver quality-assured statistic necessary successful participation emu understandably priority reform process. but challenge emu extend beyond bank’s operational framework. for example, aim participate effectively operational structure decision-making body escb alongside much large central banks, 250 people perform task involved. we are, therefore, undertake critical analysis bank’s area operation

help bank become focus efficient institution, effective participation escb undoubtedly represent heavy claim limit human financial resources. we appreciate system still developmental phase yet reach

know fondly one “guenther-grams” - think deeply broadly bank financial matters. have reflect kind issue ken mind, i think would fit today i share idea bank industry today trend see evolving. asset growth quality the weakness credit quality accompany recent recession clearly mild bank system whole, system remain strong well position meet customer need credit financial services. during past three year so, industry extend string high often record quarterly earnings, retain historically high equity risk-based capital ratios, generally enjoy robust asset growth. the industry supervisor begin exceptionally early address slippage credit standard accompany mature last expansion, timely intervention reflect modest subsequent write-off relative earnings. indeed, past several quarter volume problem asset commercial bank declined, size number bank failure recent year exceptionally small. although demand business loan remain weak, bank industry continue benefit strong demand household credit, least residential mortgage products. the outlook asset quality also favorable. a economic activity continue grow business become confident customers’ demands, business loan demand increase, pressure bank margin begin ease. during period weakness recovery, quite large amount core deposit flow back bank size reflect low interest rate alternative assets, softness stock market, public’s

weakened. history suggest that, economy strengthen further, deposit substitute become attractive bank customers, require competitive response bank deposit offer rate reliance non-core sources. community banker last half ninety demonstrate skill compete successfully markets. although deposit pattern similar, community large bank see interest difference develop portfolio past two three year worth noting. bank commentary generally emphasize extent residential mortgage finance consumer credit extension dominate portfolio expansion bank industry. in fact, growth, dominate aggregate statistics, mainly large bank phenomenon. at community banks, residential mortgage, credit card, consumer installment loan portfolio decline last three years. to sure, change may matter choice. the data suggest, example, community bank originate significant volume mortgage loan securitization others, continue acquire process large amount mortgage-backed securities. but observer note market new

community bank avoid underwrite mistake lead many problem ten fifteen year ago. borrower equity much high credit criterion much stricter. in last recession early weak recovery, saw delinquency credits. nonetheless, banker need aware historical real estate cycle that, past, place exposure severe stress. one hope improvement underwrite standard lasting. but painful lesson bank history underscore ever-present need vigilance manage geographic business line concentrations. consolidation merger acquisition bank continue, drive technology, reduce barrier entry, relaxation interstate

exchange rate intervention proposal address mr adrian orr, deputy governor reserve bank new zealand, part presentation meat new zealand annual conference whangarei, 25 march 2004. * * * i wish make comment reserve bank’s proposal capacity intervene foreign exchange market. these comment relate proposal is, not, imply business people. there two leg bank’s foreign exchange intervention objective likely use different circumstances. first, bank long stand objective restore order actual potential dysfunction foreign exchange market. if, exceptional disturb event, liquidity new zealand dollar exchange rate dry up, bank would prepare support liquidity sense normality returned. this objective bailing-out speculators, facilitate ‘hot money’ flows. it ensure foreign exchange market continue function orderly manner essential transaction occur. to meet objective, bank currently hold manage portfolio liquid, high quality, foreign currency asset would use exceptional times. the bank, last month part ongoing legal commitment advise minister finance foreign exchange matters, recommend bank hold foreign currency reserve ‘insurance’. more reserve appear necessary foreign exchange market globally grow significantly since 1984 - bank’s reserve level largely set - new zealand economy. while unlikely event well manage economy float exchange rate, new zealand economy afford face situation non-convertible currency. our foreign currency reserve need sufficient ensure situation low probability. the minister finance agree advice move increase significantly level foreign currency reserve bank manage ‘insurance’ purposes. in addition, part bank’s ongoing legal commitment advise minister finance foreign exchange matters, recommend capacity intervene foreign exchange market affect level exchange rate certain circumstances. that is, would contemplate intervene exchange rate exceptionally unjustifiably high low, think opportunity exist would ensure intervention effective. by exceptionally high low, mean exchange rate near cyclical extremes, see new zealand recent decade 3 5 year cycle. by unjustifiable, mean exchange rate move well excess relevant economic fundamentals, relative productivity, commodity prices, growth, inflation. it note time float exchange rate, like new zealand’s, perform important economic function act buff shock term trade relative business cycle pressure. we believe float exchange rate serf new zealand well. however, times, exchange rate vary far justify relevant economic fundamentals. it exceptional unjustifiable level exchange rate bank would consider buy sell foreign currency nz dollar effort influence level exchange rate. there mechanical rule underlie new objective - decision make context. an important part bank’s consideration intervene would dynamic foreign exchange market time whether feel action effective. in words, bank would intervene opportune times, currency’s direction dominate strong international trend consensus opinions. we intend waste reserve defend particular exchange rate level, intend stand way strong market trend beliefs. we also expect attract speculator think ‘take bank on’. if defend particular level exchange rate, bi review 17/2004 1 mechanical rule, intervene consistent monetary policy objective opportune times, unclear nature speculator would attract actions. by way example, recommend bank japan style intervention, use significant fund aim influence long-term trend exchange rate, stand path strong trend exchange rate. and certainly recommend defend particular level exchange rate clearly under-valued. this case, example, many east asian economy late-1990s asian financial crisis. instead, bank belief strongly virtue float exchange rate within well manage economy. what recommend intervene moment justify opportune, outcome of, best, trim extreme top bottom nz dollar exchange rate cycle. such intervention strategy would consistent bank’s primary objective achieve maintain price stability. hence, foreign exchange intervention view another instrument bank, consistent achieve monetary policy objectives, albeit secondary instrument powerful one official cash rate. intervention would consider reasonably infrequent circumstances, is, exchange rate level exceptional unjustified economic fundamentals, believe opportunity effective exists. we anticipate substantial large impact level exchange rate. however, believe positive benefit exceed relatively small manageable risk policy. give prominence level cyclical variability exchange rate investment, output, employment, inflation decisions, even small impact intervention exchange rate widely disperse economic benefits. the bank’s advantage intervention strategy ‘weight money’. instead bank’s investment horizon, information, alignment policy objective bring advantage opportunities. to successful, need business long-term. this appeal multi-party political support policy. that said, bank already ability - legal operational - intervene foreign exchange market, consistent achieve maintain primary goal price stability. what request minister additional foreign reserve intervention purposes, minimum recommend avoid dysfunction. in addition, request government inject additional capital bank’s balance sheet absorb potential temporary, unrealised, marked-to-market loss foreign exchange positions. this prudent management. such intervention strategy, relevant medium-term horizon, even prove profitable or, least, reduce cost hold foreign currency reserve avoid market dysfunction. the bank’s intention buy foreign currency (sell nz dollars) exchange rate exceptionally unjustifiably high, sell foreign currency (buy nz dollars) exchange rate significantly unjustifiably low, make good portfolio management sense - long business long-term. on average, medium term would anticipate exposure foreign exchange swings. the reserve bank’s management foreign reserve long-term business. it common central bank internationally manage foreign currency reserve manner - fund manager business game long-term would do. our assessment benefit foreign exchange intervention nature outline result considerable analysis several years. this include analyse experience internationally, academic empirical literature. it knee-jerk reaction recent level exchange rate, response political pressure. we take operational independence seriously, reason recommend new intervention policy operate bank’s legal purposes, intervention decision make within bank, consistent primary objective achieve maintain price stability. we recommend intervention capacity lightly. a part operational independence, stand prepare hold accountable outcomes, monetary policy general. but, exporters, importer anybody else deal foreign exchange, need clear ongoing considerable cyclical variability exchange rate continue even intervention 2 bi review 17/2004 successful. our intervention policy talk about, best, knock extreme top bottom nz dollar exchange rate cycle. by far bulk foreign exchange risk management responsibility remain hand business individual within nz. we offer panacea cycle, simply say think make small positive difference make sense. bi review 17/2004 3 andrew large: puzzle today’s economy - build household debt speech sir andrew large, deputy governor bank england, association corporate treasurers’

since present relatively high level debt rise fast income, likely potential vulnerability increase gear rising. and know experience unexpected shock one source another upset individuals’ prediction behaviour. doe matter? the general approach. the question matter? should really worry it? perhaps i get examine two school thought. on optimistic side, i refer earlier, argue rise debt logical response stable economic environment relaxation credit constraints. household consider wisdom give level debt take account asset prospective income. house price value financial asset risen. accordingly rise debt quite understandable many house buyer necessary. in addition, logical response number factors. first, low initial cash-flow cost service low-nominal-interest-rate environment

macro-economic point view, increase household spend finance borrow consistent overall monetary stability inflation target element demand weak. in words, logical accompaniment monetary stability time imbalance composition growth demand reflect ‘acceptable’ imbalance need keep economy growing. the pessimistic school point first fact leverage add vulnerabilities. there always unexpected shocks, level debt historical high rising. second, warn reliance wealth justify level debt provide collateral circular argument. demand house extent increase availability, time contract least, affordable

realisation implication high debt take time sink in. when interest rate falling- case uk term repo rate february 2001 july last year - borrower may feel good place service high loan might increase borrow accordingly. however, rate rise - official level - cost service outstanding debt tend rise cause repayment difficulties. bi review 17/2004 5 while element truth school thought, balance probability lie optimists. the optimistic school reflect central case, whereas pessimist incline focus risk - tail distribution like. but even probability thing go wrong near future may high, nonetheless credible threats, time risk might mount. remember public policy role, i would like drill bite ask question “does matter?” three aspects: financial stability; monetary policy; socio-economy. financial stability issue first financial stability, oversight one bank’s key responsibilities. here need focus mitigate potential impact financial system vulnerability might arise high level debt. will give rise concern repayment strains, financial failure liquidity withdrawal? could strain lead default multiple borrowers, lead turn problem intermediary providers? from point view lender i detect whole feel confidence, overall concern asset portfolio secure unsecured household debt. there significant improvement risk management systems: retail level, example, information technology enable development sophisticate model techniques. data suggest that: uk-owned banks’ capital ratio strong international historical standards; proportion new mortgage grant high loan-to-value ratio dropped; loan-to-value ratio exist mortgage fallen. mortgage arrears around all-time low. such factor help boost resilience unite kingdom’s financial system. there are, however, potential hazard - particular relate poor lend decision change behaviour borrowers. there example countries, example us, potential change attitude personal bankruptcy defaults. under scenarios, change could put pressure balance sheet lenders. furthermore, possible behaviour lender trigger response borrower behaviour. if lender get nervous credit status borrowers, turn supply credit, could cause failure default borrowers. the lender seek anticipate issues, partly price expect loss lend product offer also development risk management tool stress testing. the strength financial system increasingly reliant effectiveness risk management. a i mention earlier, potential concern wealth itself, basis increase indebtedness make possible, may wholly dependable. it could affect greatly by, example, downturn house market, difficulty corporate sector trigger reduction people’s wealth via direct indirect hold shares. not everyone affect scenarios, reduction wealth could reduce ability willingness repay debt time reduce lenders’ access collateral. so, caveats, implication oversight financial stability? first, course, need vigilant watch emerge sign weakness. but, second, number mitigants. we give warn enhance awareness implication indebtedness increasing. the financial system strengthen adherence high quality prudential framework. that current review basel capital accord important. remember design improve risk assessment lenders, wholesale level retail level well. and risk management technique supervisory process generally process significant enhancement. in early day one might consider potential mitigants. these might include credit control deliberate prudential measure increase cost lending. the fact, however, today’s liberalise capital market existence derivatised product would likelihood render impractical. 6 bi review 17/2004 monetary policy issue turn monetary policy, key focus extent vulnerability debt build-up could trigger change demand supply economy direct implication monetary stability meet inflation target. high level leverage could make demand susceptible external shock might lead precautionary saving: turn could reduce demand. equally, socio-economic factor could also cause change behaviour, even though might gradual unlikely affect member society once. in assess potential impact debt build-up demand supply, seem several important factors. first, fact demand general boost increase asset price themselves. but would happen external event break cycle asset price increases, particularly relation house prices? a sudden realisation wealth cushion support level secure debt deflate could trigger behaviour would reduce demand. second, people consumption grow rapidly disposable income, increase likely finance increase borrowing. if people decide readjust balance sheet could impact demand. third, precautionary save could increase - example, household decide need make great provision future retirement income. this could alter desire take repay debt. although would likely affect particular part population, extent impact would hard ass advance. this, course, direct relevance monetary policy. change level debt result change demand, also level vulnerabilities. these turn important bear state economy. and high leverage, great vulnerability give shock becomes. furthermore, price of, hence demand for, new debt affect policy decision itself. demand might also affect impact decision people’s expectation future rate movements. it may true fully understand transmission mechanism could lead change demand. even though price debt directly influence overall interest rate levels, cannot evaluate precision much effect give change interest rate level debt. but watch month month, quite well positioned, thank data regularly look at, judge emerge impact policy decisions. it important remember need consider fulfilment monetary policy remit time. not next two year forecast given, long term well. sudden unexpected

exacerbated, give demographic trend small number enter job market. we certainly hope issue resolve gradual adjustment time without significant impact monetary financial stability. but aspect socio

statement statement m linah k mohohlo, governor bank botswana, gaborone, 17 february 2004. * * * introduction the 2004 monetary policy statement i present tonight sixth series issue annual basis bank botswana. the statement mid-year review play central role bank’s effort convey stakeholder public large information inflation monetary developments. the statement also present opportunity bank outline detail monetary policy framework, communicate annual objective inflation, state approach take formulate bank’s response inflation-related developments, ensure inflation objective met. in respect, monetary policy statement provide opportunity bank transparent, view influence economic financial expectation economic agents. the bank aim specifically engender expectation low stable inflation, consistent broad objective macroeconomic balance basis sustainable growth country. in line past practice deliver monetary policy statement, i present main highlights, ask find time read full statement, copy provide shortly, order derive full benefit. i begin briefly review current trend inflation underlie causes, assess extent monetary policy succeed achieve relate objective 2003. i present bank’s analysis economic financial factor likely bear inflation botswana year ahead, basis policy outlook. the bank’s monetary policy framework objective for start, i wish remind bank’s policy objective framework formulate pursued. the principal objective monetary policy botswana control inflation, central banks. specifically, achievement sustainable low predictable level inflation. precisely low inflation matter debate; debatable (you concur) yet achieve goal botswana. be may, achieve domestic price stability end itself; also mean bank contributes, along government policies, fundamental objective stable macroeconomic environment rise income live standard botswana. it important point task pursue isolation; aim support national objectives, economic diversification. in broad terms, mean mindful need saver investor pursue inflation objective, set domestic interest rate high enough provide positive return saver high discourage private sector investment. it also mean take account expect inflationary development trade partner country set annual inflation objectives, monetary policy contribute, along policies, maintain botswana’s international competitiveness. the bank seek achieve, minimum, rate inflation high average inflation rate major trade partner countries. give bank’s primary concern control inflation, important source change rate inflation examine closely, bank respond change due domestic demand pressures, may due transitory factor supply fluctuation monetary policy little direct influence. hence, addition inflation data publish central statistic office, bank examine measure underlie inflation trend (core inflation), exclude impact transitory factor exceptional change administer price indirect taxes. this suggest price development ignored. the bank recognise need prepare respond, necessary, impact item might underlie inflation inflation expectation second-round effects. bi review 15/2004 1 other indicator progress meet inflation objective include rate growth commercial bank credit private sector change government spending. commercial bank credit monitor important contributor growth private consumption investment directly influence monetary policy interest rates. government spend important monetary policy large contribution overall domestic demand. it continue large role government economy underscore need complementarity fiscal monetary policy achieve inflation objective. domestic inflation trend 2003 let briefly review monetary policy development action undertake last year, share bank belief possible 2004. this include comment monetary policy implication actual potential developments. you recall context longer-term objective low stable inflation, bank’s inflation objective 2003 4 - 6 percent. through objective, bank seek influence maintain expectation sustainable low inflation environment high risk vat-induced increase inflationary expectations. moreover, bank consider aim inflation level low expect trade partner country would help regain competitiveness lose 2002 result high relative inflation botswana. the external environment generally supportive efforts. import inflation fell global inflation stay low, south africa inflation declined. here home, domestic demand pressure ease early high rate credit growth come growth government expenditure contained. the combination low global inflation reduce domestic demand pressure lead low rate inflation botswana year progressed, notably july onwards, effect vat inflation run course begin drop inflation calculation. vat major impact initial 2 - 3 month follow introduction july 2002. by end year, inflation rise annual rate 6 percent, month prior introduction tax, 11 percent. it rise first half 2003, peak annual rate 12.2 percent june; inflation begin decline effect vat waned, demand pressure eased. by december 2003, inflation almost back pre-vat levels, 6.4 percent - upper end bank’s inflation objective 6 percent. when impact vat discounted, bank estimate increase consumer price 4 5 percent, underlie inflation slightly upper end inflation objective 2003. monetary policy implementation 2003 while major concern monetary policy 2003 contain inflationary impact introduction vat, also important policy continue much possible support downward trend underlie inflation begin develop 2000 2001. in circumstances, monetary policy remain relatively restrictive much year. however, credit growth slow inflation rate declined, expected, global inflation outlook remain supportive continue low inflation abroad, bank take opportunity reduce lend rate (bank rate) twice, 50 basis point october another 50 basis point december, take 14.25 percent. these reduction bank rate follow reduction commercial bank lend deposit interest rates. indeed prime lend rate reduce two step full one percentage point 15.75 percent, match reduction bank rate. deposit interest rates, hand, reduce less amount; instance, average 88-day deposit rate fell 65 basis point 9.5 percent. despite decline domestic short-term nominal interest rates, inflation-adjusted (or real) interest rate remain high inflation declined. by year-end, real three-month bank botswana certificate (bobc) middle rate 6 percent, high comparable rate major economy south africa. the bank’s operation money market conduct year ensure short-term interest rates, particular yield three-month bobcs, consistent policy stance. 2 bi review 15/2004 market operation also use sterilise large increase liquidity arise continue fund government public officer pension fund. however, growth outstanding bobcs slow towards end 2003, increase volume fund shift government bond offshore markets. a know, p2.5 billion worth government bond issue 2003 maturity 2 years, 5 year 12 years. by end year, result yield curve downward slop yield fallen, indication market expect decrease inflation would increase possibility ease monetary policy. i already note (with satisfaction, i must say) inflation botswana fall year-end level close upper end bank’s desire range. inflation trade partner country also declined, even well beyond level expect early year. by december 2003, average inflation trade partner country 2 percentage point low early estimate 5.5 percent 6 percent. a result, relatively high inflation botswana, compare trade partner countries, mean increase year real effective exchange rate, development raise concern contribute deterioration botswana’s international competitiveness and, turn, undermine diversification efforts. this valid concern, important botswana continue pursue development policy aim diversify economy away current dependence relatively products, especially diamonds. of course, different way achieve policy goal, exchange rate strategy aim real exchange rate stability international competitiveness part whatever approach taken, important lose sight fact real durable competitiveness diversification must ultimately come improvement productivity. it context that, early month, government take decision devalue pula 7.5 percent basket currency peg (south african rand, u dollar, japanese yen, uk pound sterling euro). for part, bank continue pursue monetary policy complement development i highlight moment detail mean bank’s policy stance 2004. i hasten emphasise point sustainable way achieve maintain competitive real exchange rate maintenance low stable inflation, bank’s focus bring inflation low sustainable level reflect national objective export-led economic growth diversification, well bank’s statutory objective achieve maintain monetary stability. the outlook inflation 2004 look ahead, global economic recovery expect gather momentum 2004, current estimate world gdp growth move around 4 percent higher, compare estimate range 2.5 - 2.75 percent 2003. global inflation, however, expect remain low may even decline face continue excess capacity major industrial economies. although oil price continue volatile, currently expect move much outside opec’s target price range. inflation south africa, important external influence inflation botswana, decline sharply 2003, south african reserve bank’s target measure inflation (cpix) fall within 3 - 6 percent target first time since inception 2000. it expect inflation south africa remain within target range 2004 response low international inflation strength rand, although uncertain whether appreciation rand take place recently sustain 2004. despite relatively supportive external environment, fact botswana’s import price rise recent devaluation pula. the time extent rise depend much quickly importer adjust high cost products. on basis proportion import consumer price index, estimate high import cost could directly add 4 percentage point inflation next 6-12 months, absence offset decline inflation elsewhere economy. there also danger trader could exploit devaluation raise price across range good service justify change import costs, although constrain extent competition effective. bi review 15/2004 3 against background, prospect mixed. domestic demand pressures, indicate growth commercial bank credit government expenditure, low 2003, budget 2004/05 fiscal year project welcome reduction spend growth. it remain seen, however, whether sufficient offset demand effect pickup credit growth likely result 15 percent average wage increase public sector, may spread broad economy private business concomitantly adjust wage levels. another risk outlook domestic inflation strong expectation high future inflation devaluation engender. however, year’s increase administer price expect exceed average underlie inflation mitigate impact overall price level. in circumstances, possible that, despite effect devaluation import inflation, positive environment i note prevail first half year, thus offset initial inflationary impact devaluation. beyond period, balance risk much le favourable. while global impact domestic price likely benign, impact devaluation import price fee price domestically produce good services. furthermore, uncertainty respect value rand, depreciation may lead increase inflation regionally. domestically, acceleration rate credit growth outside range consistent bank’s inflation objective likely, give imminent increase civil service salary consequent similar action private sector. however, impact likely credit expansion domestic demand mitigate extent rate growth government expenditure increase forecast 5 - 6 percent contain 2004/05 fiscal year budget, business take measure offset possible wage rises. monetary policy stance 2004 all factor must consider set monetary policy objective 2004. importantly, order achieve level inflation contribute maintain relative stability real effective exchange rate, objective year must reflect expectation inflation trade partner countries. the forecast inflation country year low 2003 estimate use establish last year’s inflation objective 4 - 6 percent. this imply need bank low 2004 inflation objective order meet goal stable real effective exchange rate. you agree would unrealistic costly, term output employment, bank try counter full inflationary fall-out devaluation completely short period time. it necessary, result, accept direct rise inflation high import costs, focus prevent cost spill underlie inflation inflation expectations. to accommodate considerations, bank conclude inflation objective 4 - 7 percent 2004 appropriate. this allow room time economy adjust high import inflation arise devaluation, ensure potential gain competitiveness erode high inflation. the widen range (in upward direction) see loosen monetary policy. if anything, imply contrary, since allow overall inflation rise 1 percentage point result recent devaluation pula, notwithstanding fact import price likely rise significantly amount. the key task monetary policy, give inflation objective, prevent import price increase feed price domestically produce good services. inflation commodity significantly low would without devaluation. without relatively tight monetary policy stance, real danger inflation rise, drive high import price inflation expectations, point initial benefit international competitiveness result devaluation would dissipated. it essential avoid potential benefit devaluation realised. in regard, help well policy affect aggregate demand tighten help keep demand-related inflationary pressure check. a i already noted, government’s budget 2004/05 go way direction limit expenditure growth. restraint parastatals raise price would help moderate inflationary pressure arise administer price increases. a i indicate earlier, bank’s principal intermediate target rate growth bank credit private sector, important contributor growth consumption investment, hence aggregate demand. a desire range credit growth specify order facilitate keep 4 bi review 15/2004 level consistent bank’s inflation objective. the range growth rate commercial bank credit consider compatible achieve 2004 inflation objective 4 - 7 percent 12 - 15 percent. this range derive bank’s expectation rate growth non-mining sector economy (aggregate supply), desire inflation year, allowance process financial deepen economy develops. conclusion i wish conclude underscore fact year’s inflation target 4 - 7 percent prove challenging. a know, path price stability neither smooth easy, bank’s inflation objective need take account. the raise upper end range 2004 short-term tactical measure response specific set factor relate inflation 2004. the expectation future inflation objective relate directly expect trade partner inflation rates, order ensure real exchange rate stability bank’s long term objective low stable inflation. against background recent devaluation, difficult ensure downward trend inflation occur second half 2003 sustain throughout 2004, i assure bank conduct monetary policy objective ensure inflation fall within desire range 4 - 7 percent end 2004. the bank remain commit respond necessary appropriately monetary inflation developments, particular deviation credit government spend growth level consistent inflation objective. i thank patience attention. bi review 15/2004 5 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, mr lucas papademos, vice-president european central bank, frankfurt, 4 march 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, welcome monthly press conference. the vice-president i report outcome today’s meet govern council ecb. overall, govern council confirm previous assessment favourable outlook price stability euro area medium term. against background, conclude current stance monetary policy remain appropriate. the key ecb interest rate therefore leave unchanged low levels. our monetary policy stance provide support economic recovery euro area. we continue monitor carefully development could affect assessment risk price stability medium term. let turn detail economic analysis. accord eurostat, fourth quarter 2003 real gdp euro area grow 0.3% quarter quarter, follow growth 0.4% third quarter. these data confirm gradual recovery economic activity euro area take place second half 2003. more recent indicator point moderate economic growth also early 2004. while growth relatively modest far, external domestic factor give reason expect strengthen recovery 2004 beyond. on external side, recent indication confirm global economic growth 2004 robust broadly base across different region world. overall, euro area export grow significantly year next. on domestic side, condition recovery private demand place. over recent month sign stabilisation investment. accord eurostat, fix capital investment grow last quarter 2003, record three successive quarter-on-quarter declines. corporate earn generally improve euro area, follow protract restructure corporate balance sheet last years. the finance condition face corporation euro area favourable present. all factor support recovery investment. there also reason expect gradual increase consumption growth year, follow subdue development last year. in short term, growth real disposable income support low import price tax cuts, late gradual improvement labour market condition become additional factor support income growth confidence. the financial situation household euro area sound, least comparison number industrial economies, financial impediment pick-up private consumption. for reasons, main scenario continue gradual recovery course 2004 2005 remain valid. this view share available forecast projections, also broadly reflect financial market developments. we continue see risk scenario broadly balanced. however, uncertainty relate euro area private consumption persistent imbalance region world potential repercussion sustainability global economic growth. turn price developments, accord eurostat flash estimate, annual hicp inflation rate decline 1.6% february 2004, 1.9% january. this fall mainly due base effect stem energy prices, sharp increase oil price occur early 2003 drop calculation annual rate february 2004. over come months, volatility annual inflation rate likely observed, mainly due base effect energy price well increase indirect taxes. relate this, annual inflation rate likely edge temporarily second quarter 2004. look beyond short-term fluctuation volatile component hicp, expect inflation remain line price stability. at current juncture, see little upward pressure inflation. give anticipate gradual nature recovery economic activity high level unemployment euro area, wage development remain moderate. bi review 15/2004 1 while assessment line available forecast projections, aware conditional nature exercises. we therefore continue monitor indicator closely. inflation expectations, particular, deserve close attention. turn monetary analysis, m3 growth moderate recent months. however, appear reallocation economic agents’ portfolio longer-term asset proceed rather cautiously. in respect, generally low level interest rate continue support demand liquid assets. the low level interest rate also support growth loan private sector. the high liquidity euro area need assess caution. it effect inflation medium term greatly depend extent pace future reversal past portfolio shift future strength economic growth. should excess liquidity persist, could lead inflationary pressure medium term. to sum up, economic analysis continue indicate main scenario price development come year line price stability. cross-check monetary analysis alter picture time being. with regard fiscal policies, note progress fiscal consolidation envisage countries’ stability programmes. nonetheless, continue reason concern. in countries, contrary commitments, adjustment effort insufficient mitigate risk excessive deficits. moreover, several country plan attain sound budgetary position end respective programme horizons, despite favourable growth prospects. this would risk repetition policy error last economic upswing, insufficient consolidation effort tax cut without adequate expenditure restraint lay foundation recent fiscal difficulties. all country would benefit strengthen sustainability public finances, especially expect upward phase cycle, eliminate imbalance come year avoid correct soon possible excessive deficits. moreover, determine implementation comprehensive structural reforms, expenditure side revenue side, bring additional medium-term reward form high growth sustainable public finances. such consolidation reform strategy need secure sound macroeconomic environment euro area. the euro area also require structural reform financial, product labour markets. the lisbon strategy provide appropriate blueprint progress. we welcome forthcoming spring meet european council set give renew impetus lisbon agenda, speed pace reforms, strengthen effectiveness decision-making process. structural reform enormous benefit citizen euro area. these reform crucial sustain non-inflationary growth employment, therefore also important maintain social cohesion long run. confidence among european citizen future vital strong economic recovery sustain growth. the govern council recognise still low level consumer confidence relate prevail uncertainties, include debate appropriate path structural reform many country euro area. it also partly link continue perception european citizen high inflation measure official indices. the govern council note inflation back level consistent price stability. the european public rest assure determination preserve purchase power money year come thus make contribution enhance confidence future. stable prices, together progress implementation necessary structural reforms, key strong confidence, create condition increase consumption investment thus growth job creation. we disposal questions. 2 bi review 15/2004 jean-claude trichet: paris seminar eu accession process (address) address mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, paris

speech mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual conference institute international bankers, washington, 1 march 2004. * * * the bank industry enjoy good year 2003, one bank able adapt change environment still generate record profits. several factor contribute favorable setting: low interest rates, boom mortgage bank deposit-gathering, favorable trend market-sensitive business year go on. we get first look year-end financial information call reports. although figure still preliminary, interest findings. in 2003, first time, insure commercial bank earn $100 billion dollars. these impressive profit 14 percent high 2002, point record year earnings. the industry's return asset almost 1.40 percent, return equity 15.3 percent. the level earnings, even $100 billion, may remarkable aspect industry's 2003 results. the industry earn record profit but, year progressed, change way earn profits. in words, industry adapt change business economic environment well. change really begin summer, mortgage origination begin taper longer-term interest rate rose. for eight large bank hold company major mortgage bank operations, collective mortgage loan origination volume fell 50 percent $200 billion fourth quarter. this rate decline parallel market source indicate. naturally, fee associate origination decline well, although much one might expected. mortgage origination $200 billion still strong institution historical standards, income aid favorable development mortgage servicing, namely accumulate buildup service portfolio surge mortgage lend revaluation service asset due slow prepayments. net interest margin narrow rather steadily since early 2002. a couple thing appear work. typically, margin pressure tend arise bank face stiff competitive pressure loan yield fund costs, perhaps escalation fund cost bank experience rapid asset growth. the current situation typical normal environment. the low-interest rate environment lot narrowing, along sluggish loan demand. historically low interest rate significantly reduce yield bank earn assets, especially mortgages. bank build hold mortgage market condition generate remarkable volume loans, weak demand commercial loan leave void bank balance sheet income. historically low rate new mortgage loans, together rapid prepayment higher-rate mortgages, sharply reduce yield bank mortgage portfolios. the preliminary data 2003 indicate effective yield mortgage-backed securities, include adjustable-rate products, fell 4.22 percent; late year, yield fall 3.90 percent. along pressure yields, bank face interest new pressure fund costs. for much last two years, household incline keep asset liquid flexible. interest rate low historical terms, seem provide much incentive household tie asset time deposits. the stock market - least spring last year - downward track certainly provide attractive returns. flexible bank deposit offer comfortable compromise, provide positive returns, deposit insurance, flexibility redeploy fund alternative investment become attractive. in setting, banker value core deposit even highly, pay them. in particular, favor nonmaturity deposit money market save accounts. smaller-denomination certificate deposit, contrast, decline steadily period years. influence low interest rate environment, bank reduce rate nonmaturity deposit far le money market rate fallen. the result tight margins, important potential side benefit. the success banker raise nonmaturity deposit create opportunity reclaim market share bank deposit lose bi review 14/2004 1 previous decade two. money market save accounts, particular, fund 30 percent bank assets. remarkably, despite pressures, appear bank margin recover degree late 2003. the improvement six basis points, appear significantly influence slow prepayment result increase mortgage asset yields. there host force work, suggest improvement margin may may sustainable. still, bank able turn around shrink margins. perhaps big contributor strong earn steady improvement asset quality - consistent gradually improve economy - allow low charge-offs low provisions. by end 2003, problem asset fall 0.94 percent loans, considerably peak level credit cycle 1.27 percent september 2002. improvement economic condition key reason sustain decline, along liquidity depth secondary market trouble loans. we also think good risk management - particular, good diversification - contribute decline. with charge-offs problem asset decline year, credit quality track improve further, economy improves. a result, expect bank able take provision still low maybe reserve well. one area bank profit lose grind security gains. low interest rate increase market value bank security holdings, create opportunity bank sell security take result gain income. book gain significantly enhance near-term profits, course price low future net interest earnings. in case, increase longer-term interest rate summer mean opportunity security gains-taking faded. so current contribution earn security gains. bank still see significant relief weak business loan demand. in business cycle, firm reluctant borrow - part uncertainty future prospects. the commercial loan business often carry attractive spreads, especially middle market. we see early sign recovery loan demand, include pickup bond issuance syndicate lending. by one indicator, least, small business confidence appear improving; development important community banks. the national federation independent business survey member regularly sale outlook come three-month period. those survey show optimism rise since summer 2003. in fact, since november number firm expect increase sale exceed expect decline 30 percentage points. the survey show wide margin positive outlook four years. at point, available indicator suggest banks' earn prospect favorable. the market seem share outlook, perhaps one reason bank stock valuation improving. ongoing consolidation industry also play role, see recent wave merger announcement among large bank hold companies. base i hear community bankers, merger acquisition among big institution historically create opportunity community banks. i bank regulator i neglect mention bank capital ratio remain strong. nearly 99 percent bank unite state well-capitalized, high proportion ever seen. some analyst express concern banker would reduce capital buff order increase dividend payments, especially tax treatment dividend income become favorable stockholders. but spite change tax code, aggregate dividend payout ratio commercial bank increase modestly, 76.4 percent income 77.4 percent income. conclusion in conclusion, u.s. bank industry healthy, strong, profitable well-positioned play proper role support growth prosperity economy. many factor make 2003 remarkable year industry look like carry 2004 well. new challenge arise move ahead, course, perhaps new opportunity well. adapt change important aspect bank business, industry's ability respond well 2 bi review 14/2004 bi review 14/2004 3 change circumstance key last year's record-setting results. i believe look forward

1918 1922. at federal reserve, willis push development new good economic statistics, face resistance take view many fact confuse issue. willis also first editor federal reserve bulletin, official publication fed, willis's time well today provide wealth economic statistics. a illustration intellectual atmosphere washington time served, willis report first copy bulletin present secretary treasury, esteem secretary replied, “this government ain't go newspaper business.” like parker willis, i professor come federal reserve board. one topic particular interest researcher performance federal reserve early days, particularly part play young u.s. central bank great depression 1930s.1 in honor willis's important contribution design creation federal reserve, i speak today role federal reserve monetary factor generally origin propagation great depression. let offer two caveat i begin: first, i mentioned, h. parker willis resign feed 1922, take post columbia university; thus, implicate mistake federal reserve make late 1920s early 1930s. second, view i express today necessarily colleague federal reserve system. the number people personal memory great depression fast shrink years, u depression convey grainy, black-and-white image men hat long coat stand bread lines. however, although depression long ago - october year mark seventy-fifth anniversary famous 1929 stock market crash - influence still much us. in particular, experience depression help forge consensus government bear important responsibility try stabilize economy financial system, well assist people affect economic downturns. dozen important government agency programs, range social security (to assist elderly disabled) federal deposit insurance (to eliminate bank panics) security exchange commission (to regulate financial activities) create 1930s, legacy depression. the impact experience depression view role government economy easily understand recall sheer magnitude economic downturn. during major contraction phase depression, 1929 1933, real output unite state fell nearly 30 percent. during period, accord retrospective studies, unemployment rate rise 3 percent nearly 25 percent, many lucky enough job able work part-time. for comparison, 1973 1975, perhaps severe u.s. recession world war ii era, real output fell 3.4 percent unemployment rate rise 4 percent 9 percent. other feature 1929-33 decline include sharp deflation - price fell rate nearly 10 percent per year early 1930s - well plummet stock market, widespread bank failures, rash default bankruptcy business households. the economy improve franklin d. roosevelt's inauguration march 1933, unemployment remain double digit rest 1 my professional article depression collect bernanke (2000). bi review 14/2004 1 decade, full recovery arrive advent world war ii. moreover, i discus later, depression international scope, affect country around world unite states. what cause depression? this question difficult one, answer important draw right lesson experience economic policy. solve puzzle depression also crucial field economics light solution would shed basic understand economy works. during depression year many decade afterward, economist disagree sharply source economic financial collapse 1930s. in contrast, past twenty year economic historian come broad consensus cause depression. a widen geographic focus depression research deserve much credit breakthrough. before 1980s, research cause depression consider primarily experience unite states. this attention u.s. case appropriate degree, u.s. economy then, today, world's largest; decline output employment unite state 1930s especially severe; many economist argue that, important extent, worldwide depression begin unite states, spread country (romer, 1993). however, much way medical researcher cannot reliably infer cause illness study one patient, diagnose cause depression easy patient (in case, national economies) study. to explain current consensus cause depression, i first describe debate exist 1980, discus recent focus international aspect depression comparative analysis experience different country help resolve debate. i already mention sharp deflation price level occur contraction phase depression, far severe episode deflation experience unite state since. deflation, like inflation, tend closely link change national money supply, define sum currency bank deposit outstanding, case depression. like real output prices, u.s. money supply fell one-third 1929 1933, rise subsequent year output price rose. while fact money, prices, output decline rapidly early year depression undeniable, interpretation fact subject much controversy. indeed, historically, much debate cause great depression center role monetary factors, include monetary policy influence national money supply, condition bank system. view change time. during depression itself, several decade following, economist argue monetary factor important cause depression. for example, many observer point fact nominal interest rate close zero much depression, conclude monetary policy easy possible yet produce tangible benefit economy. the attempt use monetary policy extricate economy deep depression often compare “pushing string.” during first decade depression, economist look development real side economy explanations, rather monetary factors. some argued, example, overinvestment overbuilding take place ebullient 1920s, lead crash return investment prove le expected. another once-popular theory chronic problem “under-consumption” - inability household purchase enough good service utilize economy's productive capacity - precipitate slump. however, 1963, milton friedman anna j. schwartz transform debate great depression. that year saw publication now-classic book, a monetary history unite states, 1867-1960. the monetary history, name book instantly recognize macroeconomist, examine great detail relationship change national money stock - whether determine conscious policy impersonal force change bank system - change national income prices. the broad objective book understand monetary force influence u.s. economy nearly century. in process pursue general objective, however, friedman schwartz offer important new evidence argument role monetary factor great depression. in contradiction prevalent view time, money monetary policy play purely passive role 2 bi review 14/2004 depression, friedman schwartz argue “the [economic] contraction fact tragic testimonial importance monetary forces” (friedman schwartz, 1963, p. 300). to support view monetary force cause great depression, friedman schwartz revisit historical record identify series error - error commission omission - make federal reserve late 1920s early 1930s. accord friedman schwartz, policy mistake lead undesirable tighten monetary policy, reflect sharp decline money supply. draw historical evidence effect money economy, friedman schwartz argue decline money stock generate feed action - inaction - could account drop price output subsequently occurred.2 friedman schwartz emphasize least four major error u.s. monetary policymakers. the fed's first grave mistake, view, tighten monetary policy begin spring 1928 continue stock market crash october 1929 (see hamilton, 1987, bernanke, 2002a, discussion). this tighten monetary policy 1928 seem particularly justify macroeconomic environment: the economy emerge recession, commodity price decline sharply, little hint inflation. why federal reserve raise interest rate 1928? the principal reason fed's ongoing concern speculation wall street. feed policymakers draw sharp distinction “productive” (that is, good) “speculative” (bad) us credit, concern bank lend broke investor fuel speculative wave stock market. when fed's attempt persuade bank lend speculative purpose prove ineffective, feed official decide dissuade lend directly raise policy interest rate. the market crash october 1929 showed, anyone doubt it, concert effort feed bring stock prices. but cost “victory” high. accord friedman schwartz, fed's tight-money policy lead onset recession august 1929, accord official date national bureau economic research. the slowdown economic activity, together high interest rates, likelihood important source stock market crash follow october. in words, market crash, rather cause depression, popular legend it, fact largely result economic slowdown inappropriate monetary policy precede it. of course, stock market crash worsen economic situation, hurt consumer business confidence contribute still deep downturn 1930. the second monetary policy action identify friedman schwartz occur september october 1931. at time, i discus detail later, unite state great majority nation gold standard, system value currency express term ounce gold. under gold standard, central bank stand ready maintain fix value currency offer trade gold money legally determine rate exchange. the fact that, gold standard, value currency fix term gold imply rate exchange two currency within gold standard system likewise fixed. a system fix exchange rates, gold standard subject speculative attack investor doubt ability country maintain value currency legally specify parity. in september 1931, follow period financial upheaval europe create concern british investment continent, speculator attack british pound, present pound bank england demand gold return. face heavy demand speculator gold widespread loss confidence pound, bank england quickly deplete gold reserves. unable continue support pound official value, great britain force leave gold standard, allow pound float freely, value determine market forces. with collapse pound, speculator turn attention u.s. dollar, (given economic difficulty unite state experience fall 1931) look many next currency line devaluation. central bank well private investor convert substantial quantity dollar asset gold september october 1931, reduce federal reserve's gold reserves. the speculative attack dollar also help create panic u.s. bank 2 bernanke (2002b) give detail discussion evidence present friedman schwartz. bi review 14/2004 3 system. fear imminent devaluation dollar, many foreign domestic depositor withdraw fund u.s. bank order convert gold assets. the worsen economic situation also make depositor increasingly distrustful bank place keep savings. during period, deposit insurance virtually nonexistent, failure bank might cause depositor lose savings. thus, depositor fear bank might fail rush withdraw funds. bank panics, severe enough, could become self-confirming prophecies. during 1930s, thousand u.s. bank experience run depositor subsequently failed. long-established central bank practice require feed respond speculative attack dollar domestic bank panics. however, feed decide ignore plight bank system focus stop loss gold reserve protect dollar. to stabilize dollar, feed raise interest rate sharply, view currency speculator would le will liquidate dollar asset could earn high rate return them. the fed's strategy worked, attack dollar subside u.s. commitment gold standard successfully defended, least moment. however, feed choose tighten monetary policy despite fact macroeconomic condition - include accelerate decline output, prices, money supply - seem demand policy ease. the third policy action highlight friedman schwartz occur 1932. by spring year, depression well advanced, congress begin place considerable pressure federal reserve ease monetary policy. the board quite reluctant comply, response ongoing pressure board conduct open-market operation april june 1932 design increase national money supply thus ease policy. these policy action reduce interest rate government bond corporate debt appear arrest decline price economic activity. however, feed official remain ambivalent policy monetary expansion. some view depression necessary purge financial excess build 1920s; view, slow economic collapse ease monetary policy delay inevitable adjustment. other officials, note among indicator low level nominal interest rates, conclude monetary policy fact already quite easy done. these policymakers appear appreciate that, even though nominal interest rate low, ongoing deflation mean real cost borrow high loan would repay dollar much great value (meltzer, 2003). thus monetary policy fact easy all, despite low level nominal interest rates. in event, feed official convince policy ease advocate congress appropriate, congress adjourn july 1932, feed reverse policy. by latter part year, economy relapse dramatically. the fourth final policy mistake emphasize friedman schwartz fed's ongoing neglect problem u.s. bank sector. a i already described, bank sector face enormous pressure early 1930s. a depositor fear health bank grew, run bank become increasingly common. a series bank panic spread across country, often affect bank major city even entire region country. between december 1930 march 1933, president roosevelt declare “banking holiday” shut entire u.s. bank system, half u.s. bank either close merge banks. survive banks, rather expand deposit loan replace bank lose panics, retrench sharply. the bank crisis highly detrimental effect broad economy. friedman schwartz emphasize effect bank failure money supply. because bank deposit form money, close many bank greatly exacerbate decline money supply. moreover, afraid leave fund banks, people hoard cash, example bury save coffee can back yard. hoard effectively remove money circulation, add deflationary pressures. moreover, i emphasize early research (bernanke, 1983), virtual shut u.s. bank system also deprive economy important source credit service normally provide banks. the federal reserve power least ameliorate problem banks. for example, feed could aggressive lend cash bank (taking loan investment collateral), could simply put cash circulation. either action would make easy bank obtain cash necessary pay depositors, might stop bank run result bank close failures. indeed, central element federal reserve's original mission provide type assistance bank 4 bi review 14/2004 system. the fed's failure fulfill mission was, again, largely result economic theory hold federal reserve leadership. many feed official appear subscribe infamous “liquidationist” thesis treasury secretary andrew mellon, argue weed “weak” bank harsh necessary prerequisite recovery bank system. moreover, fail bank relatively small member federal reserve system, make fate le interest policymakers. in end, feed official decide intervene bank crisis, contribute precipitous fall money supply. friedman schwartz discus episode policy action well, federal reserve's misguide tighten policy 1937-38 contribute new recession years. however, four episode i describe capture gist friedman schwartz argument that, variety reasons, monetary policy unnecessarily tight, depression begin dramatic downward phase. a i mentioned, friedman schwartz produce evidence historical period suggest contractionary monetary policy lead decline price output. friedman schwartz conclude therefore find smoke gun, evidence much severity great depression could attribute monetary forces. friedman schwartz's argument highly influential universally accepted. for several decade monetary history published, debate rag importance monetary factor depression. opponent make several objection friedman schwartz thesis worth highlight here. first, critic wonder whether tighten monetary policy 1928 1929, though perhaps ill advised, large enough lead calamitous consequences.3 if tighten monetary policy stock market crash sufficient account violence economic downturn, other, possibly nonmonetary, factor may need consider well. a second question whether large decline money supply see 1930s primarily cause effect fall output prices. a seen, friedman schwartz argue decline money supply causal. suppose, though, sake argument, depression result primarily nonmonetary factors, overspend overinvestment 1920s. a income spend decline, people need le money carry daily transactions. in scenario, critic point out, feed would justify allow money supply fall, would accommodate decline amount money people want hold. the decline money supply case would response to, cause of, decline output prices. to put question simply, know economy money stock contract rapidly early 1930s, monetary dog wag economic tail, vice versa? the focus friedman schwartz u.s. experience (by design, course) raise question monetary explanation depression. a i mentioned, great depression worldwide phenomenon, confine unite states. indeed, economies, germany, begin decline 1929. although country escape depression entirely, severity episode vary widely across countries. the time recovery also vary considerably, country begin recovery early 1931 1932, whereas others remain depth depression late 1935 1936. how friedman schwartz's monetary thesis explain worldwide nature onset depression, difference severity time observe different countries? that debate stand around 1980. about time, however, economic historian begin broaden focus, shift heavy emphasis event unite state 1930s increase attention development around world. moreover, rather study country individually, new scholarship take comparative approach, ask specifically country fare good others 1930s. a i explain, research uncover important role international monetary forces, well domestic monetary policies, explain depression. specifically, new research find complete understand depression require 3 there le debate period 1931-33, precipitous downward phase depression, economist incline ascribe important role monetary factors. bi review 14/2004 5 attention operation international gold standard, international monetary system time.4 a i already mentioned, gold standard monetary system participate country define monetary unit term certain amount gold. the set currency's value term gold define system fix exchange rates, relative value (say) u.s. dollar british pound fix rate determine relative gold content currency. to maintain gold standard, central bank promise exchange actual gold paper currency legal rate. the gold standard appear highly successful 1870 begin world war i 1914. during so-called “classical” gold standard period, international trade capital flow expand markedly, central bank experience relatively problem ensure currency retain legal value. the gold standard suspend world war i, however, disruption trade international capital flow country need financial flexibility finance war efforts. (the unite state remain technically gold standard throughout war, many restrictions.) after 1918, war ended, nation around world make extensive effort reconstitute gold standard, believe would key element return normal function international economic system. great britain among first major country return gold standard, 1925, 1929 great majority world's nation do so. unlike gold standard world war i, however, gold standard reconstitute 1920s prove unstable destabilizing. economic historian identify number reason reconstitute gold standard much le successful prewar counterpart. first, war leave behind enormous economic destruction dislocation. major financial problem also remained, include large government debt war bank system whose solvency deeply compromise war period hyperinflation follow number countries. these underlie problem create stress gold standard exist degree war. second, new system lack effective international leadership. during classical period, bank england, operation since 1694, provide sophisticate management international system, cooperation major central banks. this leadership help system adjust imbalance strains; example, consortium central bank might lend gold one number experience shortage reserves. after war, great britain economically financially deplete unite state ascendance, leadership international system shift default federal reserve. unfortunately, fledgling federal reserve, decentralize structure inexperienced domestically focus leadership, prove task manage international gold standard, task linger hatred dispute war would make difficult even most-sophisticated institution. with lack effective international leadership, central bank 1920s 1930s devote little effort support overall stability international system focus instead condition within countries. finally, reconstitute gold standard lack credibility prewar counterpart. before war, ideology gold standard dominant, point financial investor doubt central bank would find way maintain gold value currency matter circumstances. because conviction firm, speculator little incentive attack major currency. after war, contrast, economic view political balance power shift way reduce influence gold standard ideology. for example, new labor-dominated political party skeptical utility maintain gold standard increase unemployment. ironically, reduce political ideological support gold standard make difficult central bank maintain gold value currencies, speculator understand underlie commitment adhere gold standard cost weaken significantly. thus, speculative attack become much likely succeed hence likely occur. 4 critical early research include choudhri kochin (1980) eichengreen sachs (1985). eichengreen (1992, 2002) provide extensive analysis role gold standard cause propagate great depression. temin (1989) provide readable account slightly different perspective. 6 bi review 14/2004 with international focus, particular attention role gold standard world economy, scholar able answer question regard monetary interpretation depression i raise earlier. first, existence gold standard help explain world economic decline deep broadly international. under gold standard, need maintain fix exchange rate among currency force country adopt similar monetary policies. in particular, central bank limit gold reserve option raise interest rate interest rate raise abroad; so, would quickly lose gold reserve financial investor transfer fund country return higher. hence, federal reserve raise interest rate 1928 fight stock market speculation, inadvertently force tighten monetary policy many country well. this tighten abroad weaken global economy, effect feed back u.s. economy financial system. other countries' policy also contribute global monetary tighten 1928 1929. for example, france return gold standard 1928, build gold reserve significantly, expense countries. the outflow gold france force country reduce money supply raise interest rates. speculative attack currency also become frequent depression worsened, lead central bank raise interest rates, much like federal reserve 1931. leadership federal reserve might possibly produce good international cooperation appropriate set monetary policies. however, absence leadership, worldwide monetary contraction proceed apace. the result global economic decline reinforce effect tight monetary policy individual countries. the transmission monetary tighten gold standard also address question whether change money supply help cause depression simply passive response decline income prices. country gold standard often force contract money supply policy development countries, domestic events. the fact contraction money supply invariably follow decline output price suggest money cause effect economic collapse countries. perhaps fascinate discovery arise researchers' broad international focus extent country adhere gold standard severity depression closely linked. in particular, long country remain commit gold, deep depression late recovery (choudhri kochin, 1980; eichengreen sachs, 1985). the willingness ability country remain gold standard despite adverse development 1930s vary quite bit. a country join gold standard system all; include spain (which embroil domestic political upheaval, eventually lead civil war) china (which use silver monetary standard rather gold standard). a number country adopt gold standard 1920s leave force gold relatively early, typically 1931. country category include great britain, japan, several scandinavian countries. some countries, italy unite states, remain gold standard 1932 1933. and diehards, notably so-called gold bloc, lead france include poland, belgium, switzerland, remain gold 1935 1936. if decline money supply induce adherence gold standard principal reason economic depression, country leave gold early able avoid bad depression begin early process recovery. the evidence strongly support implication. for example, great britain scandinavia, leave gold standard 1931, recover much early france belgium, stubbornly remain gold. a friedman schwartz note book, country china - use silver standard rather gold standard - avoid depression almost entirely. the find time country leave gold standard key determinant severity depression time recovery show hold literally dozen countries, include develop countries. this intrigue result provide additional evidence importance monetary factor depression, also explain time recovery depression differ across countries. the find leave gold standard key recovery great depression certainly confirm u.s. experience. one first action president roosevelt eliminate constraint u.s. monetary policy create gold standard, first allow dollar float reset value significantly low level. the new president also address another major source monetary contraction, ongoing bank crisis. within day bi review 14/2004 7 8 bi review 14/2004 inauguration, roosevelt declare “bank holiday,” shut bank country. bank allow reopen certify sound financial condition. roosevelt pursue measure stabilize bank system well, creation deposit insurance program. with gold standard constraint remove bank system stabilized, money supply price level begin rise. between roosevelt's come power 1933 recession 1937-38, economy grow strongly. i scratch surface fascinate literature cause great depression, time i conclude. economist make great deal progress understand great depression. milton friedman anna schwartz deserve enormous credit bring role monetary factor fore monetary history. however, expand research focus include experience wide range country provide additional support role monetary factor (including international gold standard) enrich understand cause depression. some important lesson emerge story. one lesson idea critical. the gold standard orthodoxy, adherence federal reserve policymakers liquidationist thesis, incorrect view low nominal interest rate necessarily signal monetary ease, lead policymakers astray, disastrous consequences. we underestimate need careful research analysis guide policy. another lesson central bank governmental agency important responsibility maintain financial stability. the bank crisis 1930s, unite state abroad, significant source output declines, effect money supply credit supplies. finally, perhaps important lesson price stability key objective monetary policy. by allow persistent decline money supply price level, federal reserve late 1920s 1930s greatly destabilize u.s. economy and, work gold standard, economy many nation well. jaime caruana: the new accord stand today address mr jaime caruana, governor banco de españa chairman basel committee bank supervision, annual washington conference institute international bankers, washington, 1 march 2004. * * * i. introduction i would like thank institute international banker invite join great city washington, d.c. a non-us regulator participating, honour, perhaps daunt one, try present reflection perspective basel committee bank supervision conference. yet increasingly global world, bank supervisor need coordinate work one another. the benefit i often find meet friend colleagues, within outside basel committee. i please see several today. this include chairman powell, plus course colleague bill mcdonough, serve chairman basel committee bank supervision me, mike zamorski fdic. for nearly forty years, iib serve exchange view issue affect u.s. activity internationally active bank organisations. it also forum banker discus issue regulator policymakers. an active dialogue banks, supervisors, policymakers essential maintain regulatory framework relevant robust. along lines, i would like thank participate one important dialogue bank supervision today, namely committee’s consultation new basel accord bank capital requirements. many industry participant write comment letters, participate discussions, provide u practical data. your suggestion help u clarify simplify proposal “three pillars” minimum requirements, supervisory review, market discipline. we listen carefully and, thank hard work industry support supervisory agency central banks, proposal new accord improve dramatically since first draft publish 1999. the process revise accord spark lively discussion among industry, policymakers, regulators, naturally, also among business community, popular press, constituencies. one might ask many care much something seemingly esoteric bank capital requirements. the answer, i think, lie unique public function bank provide. bank settle payment among business consumers. they channel save provide credit, vital promote economic growth. and safeguard public wealth. yet bank cannot fulfil task long fail remain adequately capitalise manage risk properly. capital is, all, bank’s last line defence. even appropriate risk management, occasion reserve exhausted, leave capital absorb bank’s losses. if capital insufficient, trouble bank may disrupt flow credit payments, lead inefficiency markets. so, many party take great interest safety soundness bank system. in remarks, i would like share think new accord stand today. i’ll cover four area interest. • i’ll begin reminder new accord important different predecessor. • that lead expectation new accord, second set issues. our overarch public policy objective promote stable financial system. to achieve goal, new accord contain several transmission mechanism i elaborate upon, namely encourage improvement risk management promote great cooperation financial supervisors. • find way accomplish wide range objective easy task. in third batch remarks, i’ll address challenge question face draft new accord. bi review 14/2004 1 • finally, i’ll conclude offer think work ahead. ii. why new accord important different predecessor? allow begin focus first area interest try answer many supervisors, central banks, bank organisation invest much hard work revise basel accord. perhaps part explanation know, benjamin franklin did, diligence mother good luck. but diligence hard explain consider that, many ways, exist 1988 accord already tremendous success story. the 1988 accord simple apply. it represent first internationally accept definition measure bank capital. it adopt 100 country come acknowledge one benchmark measure bank’s financial health. that beg question. if 1988 accord successful, basel committee publish huge number page way improve it? why several hundred commercial organisation participate hundred hour meet write hundred comment letter us? the best explanation exist rule overtake pace innovation bank system. the simplicity 1988 accord asset promote acceptance, simplicity quickly become liability banker supervisor alike. over past 16 years, methodology measure manage risk evolve way architect 1988 accord could anticipated. improvement technology telecommunication change speed bank collect analyse data exposures. the explosive growth market securitised asset credit derivative offer bank new way manage transfer credit risk. and new discipline risk management emerge - namely, operational risk management - bank quantify increasingly reliable manner risk loss stem failure internal process system damage cause external disruption. a art risk management become sophisticated, static simple rule 1988 accord become le relevant advance banks. lead bank increasingly view old rule burden, constrain ability administer business relative best information practice available today. supervisors, part, le le confidence measure risk 1988 accord lay bank engage sophisticate form risk take risk mitigation. iii. the goal new accord: financial stability resilience by late 1990s, become clear lead bank supervisor need new accord. but one person particular know much merely revise minimum requirements. bill mcdonough, previous chairman committee, convince leader industry, central banks, supervisory agency recognise provide incentive advance state art risk management across industry. he seek reduce amount capital hold bank system rather seek increase stability global financial system - goal would benefit banks, broadly business consumers. this lead second part remarks, namely expect new accord. a result bill’s initiative, committee set overarch goal promotion great financial stability. the member basel committee believe that, individual bank adequately capitalise well managed, become stable good able withstand period financial distress. but importantly, bank proper incentive manage risk appropriately hold adequate level capital, believe entire financial sector become resilient, le sensitive business cycle, good able act source sustainable growth broad economy. increasingly, policymakers central banker recognise financial stability public good much like price stability. all u long understand benefit price stability need sound monetary policy pursuit smooth economic growth. in recent years, learn concurrent need stable financial system well. that include need business consumer access credit fair reasonable term stage 2 bi review 14/2004 business cycle build grow. we need efficient resilient payment system maintain flow fund economy times. we need financial market remain active, liquid, trust regardless event economy. give unique position bank crossroad business consumer every economy - special role intermediary credit - nothing threaten financial stability presence poorly manage poorly capitalise bank institutions. however, financial stability, like price stability, something legislate existence. the new basel accord seek great financial stability several mechanisms, might consider objective themselves. some mechanism already present 1988 accord, set minimum quantitative capital requirement level play field. but i want focus i see two innovation new accord. the first encourage improvement banks’ internal risk management processes, should, turn, anchor good corporate governance. the second promote great cooperation coordination among supervisor across jurisdictions. risk management corporate governance the first objective encourage bank improve risk measurement management techniques. the exist rule set quantitative requirement capital - is, much capital dollar term bank hold relative kind risk exposure has. the new accord improve quantitative requirement make risk sensitive closely tailor banks’ practices. but supplement set incentive bank strengthen structure process ass manage risk exposures. to encourage enhancement internal control risk management processes, new accord offer explicit economic incentive bank adopt accurate measure risk sophisticate mean control exposure risks. of course, risk management must base strong foundation corporate governance. corporate scandal side atlantic - elsewhere - highlight significance capable, responsible, proactive management. the committee long recognise this, explicitly stress importance good corporate governance new accord. we include provision need board senior management understand nature level risk bank expose to, set bank’s tolerance risks, ensure strong risk management internal control adopt throughout organisation, ensure continue appropriately inform risk take on. the new accord also stress importance independent assessment audits. let mention four different example provision new accord, which, promote good risk management governance, enhance financial resilience. the adoption comprehensive, enterprise-wide view risk first, may know, new basel accord take big step forward develop clear, comprehensive, consolidate view risk bank faces. the 1988 accord focus initially bank’s exposure credit risk. in year since 1988, basel committee seek mirror evolution best practice private sector identify risk establish appropriate control them. in 1996, example, committee adopt requirement bank heavily expose market-related risks. the new accord continue trend segregate set explicit capital requirement exposure operational risk. we believe that, manager board director good sense different extent kind risk face, make inform decision enterprise-wide business line levels. the use comparable, quantitative measure risk a second step new accord take provide bank mean compare exposure different kind risks. it require bank express exposure various risk use common “language,” namely capital. by express exposure market, credit, operational risk directly comparable terms, bank manager supplement subjective expertise area objective sense relative importance each. for bi review 14/2004 3 risk capture minimum requirement first pillar, second pillar, supervisory review, premise need bank review exposure risk need supervisor evaluate internal assessments. take together, express risk exposure similar term consider exposure risk explicitly include new accord enable bank manager make decision rigorously. demand operational standard collecting, analysing, report risk data of course, quantify compare full range risks, bank must gather report information various kind exposure use common language. this bring third step toward strengthen corporate governance, namely new accord’s proposal set demand operational requirement collection, analysis, report risk data. by raise bar gather interpret data, expect improve quality, effectiveness, frequency internal reporting. that go long way toward provide senior management even individual member board accurate timely understand nature business. senior manager director must see right information right times. they must position ask tough question make hard decision confidently - it’s late. this something always expect responsible business leaders. for first time, new accord allow u recognise responsibility board senior management explicitly regulatory capital framework. the promotion transparency financial report beyond raise bar internal reporting, fourth step new accord take strengthen corporate governance promote great transparency bank’s external financial report third pillar new accord. when marketplace participant good sense bank’s financial condition, risk faces, control employs, good able make business invest decision vis-à-vis bank. the committee expect rat agency others good position evaluate bank’s condition future prospects, investor counterparties good able decide whether invest extend credit institution. the new accord’s improve transparency requirement leverage power market-based incentive bank management ass risk carefully manage responsibly. take together, four step intend renew emphasis excellence corporate governance - level front offices, back offices, board room. promote cooperation, coordination, consistency supervisor so far, i focus improvement within bank help make financial sector stable. the second objective i mention today promote great cooperation, coordination, consistency way bank supervisor evaluate capital adequacy. when supervisor across jurisdiction share similar expectation evaluate bank’s capital adequacy, foster competitive equality lessen regulatory burden bank allow concentrate manage exposure business - rather manage try balance differ even conflict requirement set individual supervisors. the iib, one, express special concern supervisory coordination cooperation, i address moment. iv. response current concern realise inter-related objective attain great financial stability require comprehensive framework assess adequacy bank’s capital. this result what, i must confess, complicated-looking accord le sophisticated, much le comprehensive, exist accord. we’ve offer formulas, annexes, shortage footnotes. the astrophysicist stephen hawkins tell every equation include book would cut sale half: perhaps lesson there. i’d like turn third area presentation offer think question face draft accord, start potential complexity. 4 bi review 14/2004 be new accord complex? one question i hear frequently whether new basel accord complex. to degree, one might say complexity lie eye beholder. take brief glance hundred page legal documentation accompany simple debt security prospectus. you might quickly become convince instrument highly complex. yet corporate bond sell every day investors, include individual investors. regardless whether financial instrument complex, one must ask whether regulatory framework need complex well. the member basel committee know far easy enforce simple rule complicate one. still, bank long simple business. lead bank offer wide range highly evolve product services. likewise, employ sophisticate analytical tools, advance mathematical models, even dense legal document help insulate losses. what’s more, lead bank seek differentiate product continuously offer competitors. a culture constant innovation make tall order regulator develop simple rule fit bank product service permutations. in fact, complexity new accord stem banks’ request address rich variety risk practice existence today. the new accord offer bank supervisor numerous option evaluate capital adequacy intend reflect difference bank’s level sophistication. many option create precisely bank organisation think “blanket rule” would unfairly burden them. indeed, bank ask committee sacrifice new accord’s sensitivity risk, even require complexity. by provide range options, good able fit regulatory framework bank’s profile, rather way around. at time, committee work hard past five year simplify rule possible. just past january, example, committee propose way simplify treatment securitisation exposures, arise highly complex transactions. we continue seek way simplify rules, must recognise ensure comparability improve rules’ sensitivity actual risk bank face entail certain degree complexity. will difference arise country apply new accord? another reason part new accord detail stem effort maintain level play field. this lead second question i frequently asked, namely whether new accord might apply le stringently country thereby create unfair advantage bank lenient jurisdictions. indeed, iib itself, comment letter basel committee new accord u.s. supervisor domestic rule discuss here, highlight concern cross-border implementation new accord need apply share set expectation across jurisdiction minimise regulatory burden. the member committee believe competition global bank market drive bank’s business strengths, rather difference country’s rules. one way promote consistent application new accord provide bank supervisor detail requirement necessary. these detail may add length complexity new accord, may small price pay promote consistency level play field. the iib, part, ask basel committee provide clear standard cross-border implementation new accord and, especially, role home host supervisor play supervise capital new framework. the committee work hard that. last august, example, committee release paper outline six principle re-emphasise traditional responsibility home host supervisor explain responsibility continue new framework basis enhance cooperation. cooperation among supervisor critical effective supervision new accord. just past january, committee publish another set principle would apply specifically cross-border supervision advance measurement approach operational risk. the ongoing discussion accord implementation group, lead canadian superintendent financial institutions, nick lepan, likewise intend help supervisor exchange idea reach bi review 14/2004 5 share view best implement new accord domestic international bank operations. v. where stand today let move fourth point: stand today work ahead. i five remarks. first, i think committee do tremendous work past years, last month continue make significant progress number important areas: decide calibrate regulatory capital unexpected loss only; make significant headway securitisation, credit risk mitigation operational risk; clarify pillar 2, continue make progress implementation accord. of course, work yet complete, continue evaluate question comments. however, well track resolve outstanding issue middle year, line time schedule work plan set october 2003, ensure text provide solid basis national implementation process industry’s preparation continue. all compatible implementation date end-2006 previously agreed. second. it clear responsibility implement new accord domestic responsibility. a 1988 accord, member committee know process revise new accord complete, work new accord done, meaningful national process finalise member country satisfied. we sensitive national rule-making processes, continue sensitive. furthermore, third remark, committee agree that, prior implementation, review calibration new accord conduct basis additional information, may come new national impact study field test monitor bank’s parallel calculations. the committee welcome effort look forward consider results. fourth. at time, bank industry need certainty new rules, continue improve risk management system time implementation new accord. uncertainty particular new rule otherwise become form regulatory burden, bank may become le will le commit make investment system process lack confidence whether certain rule implemented. provide great sense rule help reduce burden. finally, context, i would like stress basel 2 approach intend evolutionary. in words, continue evolve order reflect continue development industry practices. we intend wait another ten year review new accord. in fact, already item agenda begin consider immediately complete mid-year text, intention find prudentially sound solution promptly possible prior implementation new accord. so, might think new accord “basel 2.0”, follow release - “basel 2.1” - on. this evolutionary approach inconsistent need certainty. on contrary, require stable framework ensure accord move target industry, well enough structure flexibility able adapt relevant change best practices. vi. conclusion in concluding, i would like note committee work group address remain issue level commitment, energy, enthusiasm bring table begin review first accord late 1990s. the openness process hard work behind u strengthen quality proposals. we expect work ahead equally fruitful. the industry seem agree, hesitate continue share view think u new accord. adopt accord serve contemporary bank require substantial commitment us. what bank supervisor learn factor drive operational, credit, market risk, good measure reduce exposure losses, mean much u simply favourable capital requirement. we advance comprehension many risk bank face sharpen ability navigate successfully. for us, 6 bi review 14/2004 bi review 14/2004 7 offer reward stable bank system le susceptible systemic risk good able circulate credit business consumer alike good time bad. alan

household business finance remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, new york forecaster club, new york, 26 february 2004. * * * it pleasure today. a relative newcomer forecast profession, i must say speak esteem group professional prognosticator bite intimidating. but newcomer often bring new perspectives, i hope remark prove informative. i intend talk briefly assessment economic outlook turn detail discussion evolution household business balance sheet recent year affect economic activity.1 the economic outlook a know, real gross domestic product grow annual rate 6 percent second half 2003, economic fundamental seem place another sizable advance year. indeed, gdp forecast federal open market committee member central tendency range 4-1/2 5 percent. yet despite recent strong pace economic activity, labor market improve slowly. i cautiously optimistic, however, job growth pick - perhaps substantially - course year. my business contact tell company indeed become optimistic economic prospect plan include increase size payrolls. the fomc expect unemployment rate fall 5-1/4 5-1/2 percent end year. although economic growth revive second half 2003, core consumer price inflation continue slow. survey suggest inflation expectation remain stable, extraordinary gain labor productivity continue keep price pressure check. moreover, i expect recent favorable price trend continue, i comfortable fomc’s prediction 1 percent 1-1/4 percent rise pce price index year - shade le increase 2003. briefly put hat monetary policy maker, i say prospect strongly grow economy, fall unemployment, low inflation seem close central banker’s ideal. under conditions, patient must, inevitably, confront need diminish substantial degree monetary accommodation place. give broad-brush summary outlook, let take close look financial position u.s. household businesses. a i discuss, favorable financial condition sector support solid increase household business expenditures. household financial condition some commentator express concern rapid growth household debt recent years. they fear household become overextend need rein spend keep debt burden control. my view, however, considerably sanguine. although pocket financial stress among households, sector whole appear good shape. certainly, household take quite bite debt past several years. accord late available data, total household debt grow annual rate 10 percent end 1999 third quarter 2003; comparison, after-tax household income increase rate 1 the opinion i express necessarily reflect colleague board governor federal open market committee. bi review 13/2004 1 6 percent. the rapid growth household debt largely reflect surge mortgage borrowing, fuel historically low mortgage interest rate strong growth house prices. despite heavy borrowing, household keep repayment burden debt check. notably, many homeowner take advantage low interest rate refinance mortgages, do several time past couple years. survey data suggest homeowner take cash one-third “refis,” often pay loan high interest rates. the result drop average interest rate household debt, combine lengthen maturity debt, temper repayment obligation grow stock debt. the federal reserve publish two series quantify repayment obligation. the first series, debt service ratio, measure require payment mortgage consumer debt share after-tax personal income. the second series, financial obligation ratio, broad version debt service ratio include require household payment rent, auto leases, homeowners’ insurance, property taxes. both ratio rise 1990s, reach peak late 2001. since then, however, recede slightly net respective peaks, indication households, aggregate, keep eye repayment burdens. because debt service ratio financial obligation ratio calculate aggregate data, necessarily indicate whether typical household experience financial stress. nonetheless, find change either ratio help predict future change consumer loan delinquencies. accordingly, fact ratio come recent peak hopeful sign household loan performance. indeed, delinquency rate wide range household loan turn second half 2003. another often-cited indicator household financial condition personal bankruptcy rate. movement bankruptcy rate, sure, partly reflect change incidence financial stress, rate trend two decade variety reasons. the bankruptcy reform act 1978 make bankruptcy attractive option household increase amount wealth household could retain bankruptcy. other factor likely contribute upward trend decrease social stigma file bankruptcy grow access credit unite states. a lender become sophisticate ability ass riskiness borrowers, extend loan household previously deny credit. these household likely default obligation typical borrower, increase risk price loan terms. although bankruptcy rate remain elevated, edge balance recent months, likely pickup economic growth unite state since mid-2003. this relatively upbeat assessment household credit quality seem share lender investor security back consumer debt. accord federal reserve’s survey senior loan officers, bank materially change lend policy consumer loan past couple years. this behavior certainly point much concern household loan performance. moreover, one get even positive message credit spread security back auto loan credit card receivables. in recent months, spread yield security swap rate comparable maturity narrow across credit spectrum. thus far, i focus liability side household balance sheet, favorable development asset side well. equity price rally strongly last year continue rise year, reverse good chunk loss sustain previous three years. in addition, home price appreciate sharply year 1997 2002. although increase home price slow somewhat lately, cumulative rise since late 1990s exceed growth per caput income wide margin. all told, ratio household net worth disposable income - useful summary sector’s financial position - recover last year stand level slightly long-term average. before i turn business sector, let address two concern voice prospect households. the first regard low level personal save rate. during past several years, personal save rate neighborhood 2 percent, well early post-world war ii average nearly 8 percent. such low personal save rate raise concern household may save enough meet longer-run needs, retirement college education children. 2 bi review 13/2004 what might behind paucity personal saving? a recently early 1990s, save rate near long-run average. one reason save rate fell 1990s rise stock market. high equity price lead consumer feel wealthier, boost spend relative income thus reduce save rate. in addition, great household wealth bring high equity price mean save goal family might - education retirement - close fulfilled. hence, household would need save le achieve goals. by logic, might expect see increase save rate aftermath sharp decline equity price 2000, 2001, 2002. it true, i note earlier, rise house price cushion losses. but, net, household wealth take hit year without commensurate rise save rate. a key factor likely boost spend - thus hold save - low level interest rates. the low interest rate work directly stimulate spend interest-sensitive sector consumer durable goods. in addition, facilitate restructure household sector’s balance sheet, positive indirect effect expenditures. in particular, past years, homeowner extract large amount home equity cash-out refinance home sales, help support consumption despite decline equity prices. a i note earlier, i think household sector overextended, thus i believe large, autonomous increase personal save rate serious risk economy. however, i would surprise see personal save rate move gradually time level consistent historical average. this rise presumably would consistent expect shift pattern growth economy - expansion lead mainly household sector one lead business spending. the second concern often express bubble may develop house price several year rapid increases. some measure price rise result improvement quality houses: house big amenity past, two characteristic lead rise average house price time. but even control quality, increase home price outstrip general price inflation considerable margin recent years. once again, low interest rate probably important factor. houses, like assets, generate expect stream future benefits. with low interest rates, future benefit discount le heavily, raise asset’s price today. low interest rate also push house price boost demand housing. of course, increase demand meet rapid pace construction new housing. but build house take time, interim, high demand push price exist houses. although identify key force behind rise house price recent years, cannot sure increase fully justify prevail fundamentals. still, need keep recent increase house price perspective: although house price outstrip broad measure inflation - even adjust quality improvement - rise nothing like increase equity price late 1990s. in fact, speculative force sometimes drive equity price extreme le likely emerge house prices. first, buy sell house lot expensive cumbersome buy sell equities, make take speculative position house much difficult. second, house market much local equity markets, national, global, scope. so speculative frenzy emerged, would much le likely spread house market equity markets. finally, financial institution much discipline process around house construction lend market past house cycles. lender today cautious lend speculative purposes, appraise value undergo scrutiny past. the expansion credit high risk household may also drive bank strengthen underwrite procedures. that said, certainly possible local house market become overvalue experience sharp price declines. house price fell significantly several part country early 1990s. but transaction cost much high house market equity market, underlie demand live space much predictable prospect give firm, large rise decline often observe stock market le likely occur market houses. in addition, lender much responsive local bi review 13/2004 3 economic conditions, generally become cautious loan underwrite unsold home local unemployment increase. financial condition business the change economy catch attention second half 2003 decline business fix investment finally ceased. capital spend business post solid increase second half last year, order nondefense capital good - key indicator equipment spend - point sizable gains. moreover, tenor anecdote corporate sector become comparatively upbeat, corporate manager see strong revenue growth much improve accommodative finance environment. four important factor contribute improvement financial conditions: low interest rates, widespread restructure corporate liability past years, sharp rebound corporate profitability trough 2001, substantial narrow market risk premiums. in addition, burden underfunded pension plans, perhaps prominent negative financial factor remains, ease late. i discus factor turn. first, firm continue benefit accommodative stance monetary policy. with federal fund rate 1 percent, short-term borrow cost remain low. for longer-term debt, combination low yield benchmark treasury security reduce risk spread keep borrow cost attractive. indeed, yield moody’s baa corporate bond index low sustain level since 1968. second, response low long-term rate nervous investor burn high-profile, unanticipated meltdowns, firm greatly strengthen balance sheets. many firm refinance high-cost debt, reduce average interest rate debt nonfinancial corporation 1 percentage point since end 2000. the average cost service debt would fall even second major trend - extension debt maturities. business replace substantial portion short-maturity debt long-maturity debt, lock low rate improve ability withstand liquidity shock (since long-term debt need continually roll over). in addition, many firm - especially trouble industry - retire debt equity offer asset sales, limit growth nonfinancial corporate debt 2002 2003 slow pace since early 1990s. third, firm significantly tighten belts. over past two years, drive cut cost generate rapid productivity gains. this great efficiency boost corporate profitability 2002 2003 despite rather tepid revenue growth. moreover, pickup revenue growth second half last year help company leverage productivity gains, produce dramatic recovery overall corporate profitability. over course 2003, operate earn s&p 500 corporation surge almost 25 percent, bring profit margin high level several years. fourth, risk premium fell substantially last year corporate governance scandal recede investor sentiment turn markedly positive. the recovery stock price reflect bright view. in addition, spread corporate bond narrow appreciably - especially risky firm - stand low level several years. this decline spread help along beneficial effect balance sheet improvement i mention moment ago. indicator corporate financial stress bond rat downgrade default rate return level normally associate economic expansion. delinquency rate business loan commercial bank also declined, survey indicate that, balance, bank recently ease term standard loans. in another sign improve sentiment, money flow risky securities. for example, equity mutual fund register strong net inflow nearly year, high-yield bond funds. the favorable tone bond market associate notable pickup junk-bond deal amid surge corporate bond issues. over past two quarters, market initial public equity offer also come back life; investor appear increasingly receptive new issues, though (fortunately) still appear selective boom late 1990s. these four point suggest financial condition capable support sustained, healthy pickup economic growth. the much improve profitability help finance expansion directly internal fund indirectly support firms’ borrow capacity. furthermore, firm able 4 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 5 draw liquid asset accumulate past couple years. and give successful effort pare costs, firm set benefit new investment plant equipment. perhaps big hurdle still face many corporation burden underfunding defined-benefit (db) pension plans, even see improvement situation year ago. at time, value pension asset significantly erode stock market losses, sharply decline interest rate raise present value plan liabilities. just among firm s&p 500, combine effect subtract nearly half trillion dollar net asset value db pension plan 2000, 2001, 2002. a result, 90 percent s&p 500 plan underfunded end 2002, net shortfall exceed $200 billion. most company db plan thus need make additional contribution pension plans, case quite substantial contributions. for many, situation sea change multiyear contribution holiday experience 1990s. indeed, 2002, s&p 500 firm contribute $46 billion pension plan - three time either previous two year - total contribution estimate even high 2003. but drain cash resource likely decline, least worsen, next years. db pension asset benefit robust return equity market since early last year, pension liability estimate rise modestly 2003. automakers, particular, already bite bullet; together solid return earn plan asset last year, cash contribution apparently help wipe much fund deficit. so longer-term prognosis firm db pensions? assume current discount rate normal pension asset returns, s&p 500 firm would eventually need make $150 billion contribution close remain fund gap. and current fund hole filled, firm would still need make contribution cover rise liabilities. indeed, db plan increasingly concentrate mature industry age workforces, growth rate liability relatively high rising. this longer-term challenge remain even current favorable market condition sustained. conclusion in summary, recent indicator suggest pace economic activity remain solid, inflationary pressure continue subdued. in addition, household business sector are, large, good financial shape. although uncertainty remain, i believe fundamental place generate sustainable economic growth. ben s bernanke: euro five - ready global role? remark mr ben s bernanke, member board governor u federal reserve system, institute international economics conference, washington, dc, 26 february 2004. the reference speech find board governor federal reserve system’s website. * * * “what appropriate domain currency area? it might seem first question purely academic since hardly appear within realm political feasibility national currency would ever abandon favor arrangement.” robert a. mundell (1961, p. 657) it honor address distinguish group occasion euro’s fifth anniversary. i congratulate institute international economics put together excellent program. the successful introduction, five year ago, entirely new currency wide range polity economy was, minimum, remarkable technical achievement. a card-carrying member club monetary economists, i like think collective expertise helpful make achievement possible. a policymaker economist, i welcome opportunity look back first five year euro see learn experience consider grand experiment imply future. i say outset that, usual, remark even reflect view necessarily colleague federal reserve system.1 the economic analysis optimal currency area began, course, robert mundell’s seminal 1961 paper, i quote above.2 a know, mundell argue that, ideally, economic similarity, political boundaries, define geographic area span common currency. he first state classic tradeoff imply decision adopt common currency. accord mundell, principal advantage common currency reduction transaction cost imply use common medium exchange across broad area. the disadvantage common currency loss shock-absorber property flexible exchange rate independent monetary policies. flexible exchange rate independent monetary policy useful shock absorber extent macroeconomic shock imperfectly correlate across regions, wage price sticky, macroeconomic adjustment mechanism - factor mobility fiscal transfer among region - weak absent. thus, mundellian perspective, case common currency within broad area stronger, great actual potential economic financial integration within area; great correlation macroeconomic shock among region within area; effective non-monetary shock absorbers, factor mobility. whether nation compose european monetary union (emu) form optimal currency area mundell’s sense widely debate researchers. for example, barry eichengreen argue early (eichengreen, 1992) europe perhaps well suit common currency economic grind (though find political motivation compelling). accord eichengreen, factor reduce desirability monetary union europe include historical variability real exchange rate among european nations, low degree labor mobility countries, low correlation underlie shock among european country among region unite states.3 other critic monetary unification, martin feldstein, stress limit extent fiscal transfer within european union. difference across country nature strength monetary policy transmission mechanism another factor may reduce attractiveness monetary union.4 however, recent assessments, 1 karen johnson member board’s international finance division provide helpful assistance comments. 2 mckinnon (1963) extend mundell’s analysis. 3 see also bayoumi eichengreen (1992). 4 the volume edit angeloni, kashyap, mojon (2003) document difference detail. bi review 13/2004 1 emphasize factor high propensity european country trade increase coherence national business cycle within europe, generally favorable (alesina, barro, tenreyro, 2002; agresti mojon, 2001). of course, analysis look historical condition ignore important possibility monetary union may induce endogenous change trade propensities, pattern macroeconomic shocks, component mundellian analysis, point eichengreen many author made. rather pursue question whether europe fact optimal currency area mundell’s sense, i think useful simply recognize european experiment economic monetary union motivate primarily mundellian factors. (mundell expect consideration would sufficient lead monetary unions, quote i begin suggests.) political factors, rather economic ones, play dominant role. the nation europe share remarkable cultural heritage philosophy, politics, science, religion, arts, advance thinker long recognize common heritage might serve basis formation cohesive european political entity. such entity presumably could influence world event provide common defense effectively could collection nation-states. indeed, political economic integration within region europe occur number occasion - example, germany italy. another important motivation political integration desire reduce risk intra-european conflict. from napoleon bismarck kaiser hitler, franco-prussian franco-german conflict flash point continentwide worldwide wars. european economic monetary union hold promise bind closely economic interest two powers, well european nations, make future intra-european conflict unthinkable. such argument part debate european integration least since 1957 treaty rome. indeed, hope policymakers create virtuous circle, close economic integration promote great political cooperation, enhance opportunity economic integration, on.5 the largely political origin union several implication economic analysis common currency. first, purely economic point view, creation european economic monetary union least partly exogenous event. thus, something natural experiment learn effect institutional innovations. second, keep mind assessment success euro, indeed entire experiment european integration, rest economic criterion also success europe political entity. if think introduction euro represent degree natural experiment monetary economics, say cost benefits, least thus far, sweep institutional change? we look number area effect monetary unification, include pattern trade, development financial sector, change macroeconomic stability, international role new currency. many area already examine today much great detail i here. rather try exhaustive, i instead assert briefly defend hypothesis. the hypothesis significant effect monetary unification felt, continue felt, development european financial markets, great economic benefit europe long run accrue improve function markets. to defend hypothesis, i need first consider briefly effect monetary unification key areas. let u begin trade. the debate monetary unification influence extent tradition empirical research provide basis optimism effect common currency trade. for example, extensive literature so-called border effect conclude nation trade far le would expect base extent trade region within country, open possibility differ national currency among factor inhibit trade. in recent study, reuven glick andrew rise (2001) provide support idea currency union promote trade. glick rise analyze panel data set 217 country period 1948 1997. they find enter leave currency union large effect trade flows; indeed, estimate pair country begin use common currency see double bilateral trade. however, glick rise note, many country enter leave currency union 5 the importance political factor european economic union also illustrate importance non-economic consideration debate join union nation sweden unite kingdom. 2 bi review 13/2004 sample period small poor, rich (in cases) large like nation western europe. moreover, analysis rule either reverse causality (that is, increase trade may promote adoption currency union, rather vice versa) possibility third, unmeasured factor (such political relationships) may influence trade currency policies. in contrast find glick rose, evidence draw directly recent european experience generally support view adoption common currency major effect magnitude direction trade.6 true, euro-area export surge adoption euro january 1999. however, cyclical condition early weakness new currency doubt play critical role increase, inference confirm substantial slow european export growth since begin 2001. also strike fact share total euro-area export destine member euro-zone increase introduction new currency, would likely common currency promote trade. indeed, 50 percent total exports, intra-euro-area export share today remain noticeably recent peak 57 percent reach early 1990s. the decisive evidence trade question find look microdata. in important study, john rogers (2003) board staff analyze annual data price 139 items, collect economist intelligence unit twenty-five european thirteen u.s. cities. for main results, rogers divide item trade non-traded categories, though consider many way slice data well. he analyze cross-city dispersion price year. of course, reduction barrier trade, harmonization tax policies, increase efficiency cross-national market lead reduce dispersion price goods, especially actively trade goods, competition arbitrage reduce local monopoly power difference prices. rogers find substantial decline dispersion traded-goods price across european city 1990-2001. indeed, end period, variability trade good price across city within emu country decline half, substantially different variability find among city unite states. this convergence price suggest powerful, ongoing process increase economic integration elimination barrier trade among member european monetary union. crucially, however, rogers find bulk convergence occur 1990 1994, period “single market” initiative. only small part convergence trade good price occur 1998, period euro introduce national currency withdraw circulation. rogers’ evidence therefore suggest increase integration product market europe ongoing process, may assist adoption euro common currency hardly prove essential. a second question interest degree adoption euro affect macroeconomic stability euro zone. in mundell’s taxonomy, adoption common currency strictly negative factor stability eliminate shock-absorbing feature flexible exchange rate independent monetary policies. in fact, however, effect common currency macroeconomic stability europe positive well negative. notably, structure mandate european central bank (ecb), well perception continuity policy pre-euro bundesbank, enhance ecb’s credibility contribute low stable inflation euro-zone. although germany several country union enjoy low inflation adoption common currency, partial exception discuss moment, ecb able “export” benefit member monetary union. the common currency also eliminate periodic exchange-rate crises, plague european monetary arrangement generate real financial disturbance least since day gold standard. on hand, ecb face challenge make policy europe whole despite differ macroeconomic condition member countries, dilemma mundell would predicted. for example, since 1999 countries, ireland, inflation rate consistently euro-zone average. irish inflation peak 7 percent twelve-month basis 6 micco, stein, ordonez (2003), use bilateral trade data early year monetary union, find modest trade-enhancing effects. bi review 13/2004 3 november 2000 since 4 5 percent range. at time, countries, germany, experience low - perhaps uncomfortably low - rate inflation.7 patrick honohan philip lane (2003) investigate source relatively high inflation ireland adoption euro. these author find loss exchange-rate flexibility monetary autonomy play important role irish inflation. for example, relatively large share ireland’s trade non-european partners, early weakness euro stimulate irish export economic activity disproportionately. ireland also unable resort monetary restraint cool economy that, variety reasons, experience fast demand growth rest europe.8 ireland’s relatively high inflation rate may turn destabilize effects, because, combination low pan-european nominal interest rates, imply irish economy face negative real rate interest. one possible consequence low real rate boom irish property prices, feed back high domestic spending. of course, end spectrum, germany experience weak growth low inflation past year (sinn, 2003). without ability use stabilize monetary policy, germany ease fiscal policy thus come conflict obligation stability growth pact. in short, respect macroeconomic stability, common currency appear positive negative effects. more time need ass whether common currency ultimately stabilize destabilize influence macroeconomic level. yet third area potential benefit euro often cite respect common currency’s potential international role. the phrase “international role euro” cover number disparate possible function currency. these function include use euro-denominated asset official reserves, use euro vehicle currency foreign-exchange transactions, denomination euro finance instrument issue borrower resident euro zone, acceptance euro-denominated euro-linked asset international investment portfolios, invoice euro internationally trade good services. of course, post-world war ii period u.s. dollar dominant international currency respect functions. it seem plausible euro, low-inflation currency use economy comparable unite state size sophistication, will, time, increase “market share” areas. however, euro’s potential international role, and, importantly, benefit euro-zone country increase role euro differ significantly function. a summary evaluation euro’s international position common currency’s role increase far euro pose le challenge u.s. dollar international medium exchange analyst expected. for example, foreign exchange market u.s. dollar account nearly 50 percent transaction “sides,” compare 25 percent euro, imply overwhelm majority foreign-exchange transaction involve dollar (european central bank, 2003, p. 26; data continuous link settlement). hence, dollar appear remain international “vehicle currency,” serve temporary abide value foreign-exchange transaction involve third currencies, whereas euro’s role foreign-exchange market similar play early time deutschemark (solans, 2003). the dollar also remain dominant invoice currency internationally trade raw materials, oil. the dollar even dominant u.s.-european trade, 90 percent u.s. export europe something 80 percent european export unite state invoice dollar september 2003 (european central bank, 2003, p. 33). with regard currency composition official reserves, dollar-denominated asset account 64.5 percent world reserve end 2002, 67.5 percent end 2000. during period, euro’s share international reserve rise 15.9 percent 18.7 percent (european central bank, 2003, p. 45). although economist financial market participant observe develop role euro international transaction interest, direct benefit euro-zone economy euro play international medium-of-exchange role relatively modest. arguably, significant 7 some cross-country difference inflation might simply reflect convergence price levels, result balassa-samuelson effect initial conversion factor national currency euro precisely consistent law one price tradables. rogers (2003) find evidence latter effect former. 8 of course, fiscal policy remain available, though economist agree fiscal policy le effective monetary policy short-run stabilization tool. 4 bi review 13/2004 aspect euro’s international role arise strengthen expansion euro-denominated financial market market take great international character. internationalization european financial market increase investment opportunities, opportunity diversification, source fund improve liquidity market efficiency. on note, let turn finally effect common currency european financial markets. a i already suggested, important benefit currency union likely continue strengthen european financial markets. traditionally, efficiency scope market hamper cost risk associate use multiple currency well fragmentation arise international difference legal structure, account rules, institutions. give rapidity frequency trade financial markets, even small transaction cost hamper efficiency liquidity markets. the common currency, ongoing effort harmonize financial regulation institutions, significantly reduce transaction costs. together low country-specific macro risk arise adoption common currency, reduction transaction cost greatly improve breadth efficiency european financial markets. importantly, benefit efficient financial market go well beyond benefit financial investor financial industry itself. a grow academic literature suggest financial development critical precursor broad economic development (king levine, 1993). in vein, study european commission estimate financial development bring european financial system close u.s. norm might add almost percentage point growth value add manufacture european union (giannetti et al., 2002). whether one accept optimistic assessment not, evidently significant potential benefit financial deepen go beyond financial sector itself. how common currency improve financial efficiency? perhaps dramatic effect monetary union financial sphere fixed-income markets, government private. government debt markets, size, safety, benchmark status, central vibrant fixed-income market, particularly strengthen adoption euro. notably, since run-up monetary union began, sovereign debt yield converge remarkable extent. for example, 1990 1996, spread italian spanish government bonds, relative german bond comparable maturity, average 430 350 basis points, respectively. today spread pay government quite small, vicinity 15 basis point german equivalent italy essentially zero spain.9 clearly, government benefit substantially reduction inflation risk exchange rate risk provide common currency.10 the addition sovereign default risk (now relevant individual country long able inflate away debts) evidently offset benefits, perhaps effect stability growth pact. beyond improve fundamental government finances, common currency also increase depth breadth government bond markets. in particular, development large market euro-denominated government debt result expansion cross-border hold debt improve market liquidity opportunity risk sharing. for example, excellent survey development european financial market since introduction euro, gabriele galati kostas tsatsaronis (2003, p. 174) note nonresident hold french government bond rise 15 percent end 1997 35 percent 2002. moreover, 2002, foreigner hold three-quarters belgian government long-term bond 63 percent irish government debt. a broad investor clientele imply potential bidder primary market transaction secondary markets, improve liquidity. this broaden sense international role euro, i mean internationalize european financial markets, seem promise great potential benefits. the european government bond market substantially strengthen adoption common currency, attain liquidity u.s. treasury market (and may never so). although aggregate issuance euro-zone government debt order magnitude 9 so-called “convergence plays” prove profitable financial investor bet success european monetary union implication government debt spread would largely disappear. 10 it interesting, however, even nonmember sweden unite kingdom see bond yield converge german benchmark since 1997 1998. bi review 13/2004 5 u.s. treasury issues, remain fundamental difference euro-zone debt debt twelve sovereign entities, rather one unite states. naturally, stability growth pact notwithstanding, european union accept collective responsibility debt individual governments. moreover, far coordination issuance schedules, structure issues, technical detail limited. however, opportunity strengthen euro-zone government bond market appear remain. for example, technical detail work out, one imagine issuance security back obligation multiple european governments. these security could make uniform fix country share underlie debt, strip country-specific default risk instrument credit default swaps. such security would provide benchmark yield curve, among advantages. the benefit euro government bond market carry corporate bond market well. issuance euro-denominated bond corporation take soon introduction new currency. although much boom doubt reflect general macroeconomic condition factors, potential access much large base investor will hold bond common currency result improvement price liquidity also play role. underwrite cost also fallen, result great competition reduce cost bring issue market (santos tsatsaronis, 2003). the rapid development europe’s corporate bond market, include nascent high-yield market, prove highly beneficial european economic development. the benefit common currency type security market mix thus far, potential there. the european interbank market strengthen substantially tandem creation eurosystem central banks. in contrast, market security lend (repo markets) remain somewhat fragmented, commercial paper market underdeveloped. european stock markets, case account small share finance activity unite states, successfully harmonize thus far, cross-border equity investment may still involve high transaction cost (mcandrews stefanadis, 2002). however, widely observe perspective strategy european equity analyst changed, toward de-emphasis country-specific factor great attention industry company factor valuation stock (adjaouté danthine, 2002). this change indicate financial market participant see increase financial economic integration europe irreversible trend. effort adhere lamfalussy process, aim streamline harmonization process financial market legislation regulation, hasten integration european security markets. european finance traditionally bank-centered. what happen bank new regime? bank may lose loan customer grow security markets, also benefit increase access finance, interbank market corporate bond market. indeed, bank large player early boom issuance euro-denominated corporate bonds, account half new issue thus far (galati tsatsaronis, 2003, p. 181). on lend side, banks’ local knowledge specialize service allow retain important market share. in study illustrate importance banks’ knowledge local conditions, allen berger david smith (2003) find european affiliate multinational corporation strongly prefer work bank country operation, rather bank country multinational’s corporate headquarters. moreover, choose bank country operations, affiliate likely select bank local regional operation bank global reach. these result consistent view bankers’ competitive advantage relative security market knowledge local firms, markets, economic condition ability establish long-term relationship local customers. perhaps european bank situation begin look like unite states, borrow security issuance bank co-exist, provide different service meet need different clienteles. moreover, composition bank may settle pattern unite states, large bank global reach capacity engineer highly complex transaction community bank specialize lend local area find room flourish. however bank may evolve europe, increase financial integration make local bank market “contestable” likely improve efficiency local bank service delivered. my remark even scratch surface large topic, seem safe conclude common currency continue large benefit european finance. at minimum, single currency eliminate exchange-rate risk exist security denominate different currencies. the single unit account seem also likely reduce 6 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 7 transaction cost eliminate portion fix cost involve issue similar security multiple currencies. these factor already serve moderate home bias borrow lending, lead larger, more-liquid, more-diversified financial markets. clearly, great deal work need done, government private sector, realize full benefit common currency european finance. beyond market i mention need special attention, like equity markets, harmonization also require coordinate national system payments, clearing, settlement. a large integrate financial system may carry great systemic risk raise new challenge system financial oversight supervision. further challenge arise new countries, include currently relatively low level financial development, join european monetary system. their accession greatly complicate harmonization process, give know role finance economic development, benefit new member current one could large. seung park: korea’s experience choice bank supervisory arrangement speech dr seung park, governor bank korea, 39th seacen governors’ conference, colombo, sri lanka, 12 february 2004. * * * 1. introduction this afternoon, i would like talk korea’s experience reform financial supervisory system. in april 1998, korea establish integrate financial supervisory body responsible banking, securities, insurance. a may well aware, unite kingdom japan launch integrate financial supervisory system : u.k. october 1997 japan june 1998. in ways, therefore, korea go along new international trend toward bring together financial supervision within single agency. the republic china, governor fai-nan perng correct i wrong, intend set integrate financial supervisory body july. and people’s republic china has, meanwhile, strip central bank bank supervisory function establish separate bank supervisory agency. in seacen member countries, i understand central bank exercise function bank supervision. so i think fellow governor may deep interest proposal establish separate financial supervisory body. i believe korea’s experience, regard, may help area. let express deep thank gracious host, governor jayawardena, provide opportunity. 2. establishment integrate financial supervisory agency the financial supervisory system prior integration until 1998 reorganization, korea several supervisory body responsible different type financial institutions. the office bank supervision bank korea(bok) supervise commercial banks. it authorize market entry new banks, lay prudential regulations, hold on-site examinations, exercise discipline them. two major supervisory body security supervisory board responsible security company insurance supervisory board, insurance company watchdog. both supervisory body come direction ministry finance economy(mofe). debate integration financial supervisory body great change had, however, take place financial institutions’ operate environment particularly since mid 1990s. follow korea’s admission oecd late 1996, competition korean financial market become fierce fierce financial capital market throw open line oecd criteria. banks, security company insurance company seek expand turf linkage grow much closer. a enterprise transaction various type financial institutions, money flow grow increasingly complex. meanwhile, scale korean economy expand structure become complicated. an important new task emerge : roll back government intervention economy name improve efficiency. from early 1997, korean government begin press ahead financial reform bring together various independent supervisory body single roof. it also seek strengthen bok’s independence monetary policy. the government’s step toward establishment bi review 13/2004 1 integrate financial supervisory body naturally ignite debate idea take away central bank’s bank supervisory function. the bok time strongly oppose government’s plans. firstly, lender last resort, central bank position monitor insolvency liquidity status banks. this also necessary secure stability payment settlement system. therefore essential bok keep bank supervisory function. secondly, stress politically neutral central bank carry bank supervision, process need shield political pressure. it also efficient bank supervision remain entrust bok, already possess adequate human physical resources. the government, part, advocate bank supervision separate bok conflict interest might arise monetary policy supervisory policy. for example, central bank ease monetary policy maintain financial stability, could damage price stability core goal central bank. furthermore, government point worry central bank might become overly powerful, retain right supervise bank grant independence monetary policy. the plan establish integrate supervisory body become bogged clash opinion bok government. it gain new lease life, though, situation take new turn aftermath outbreak currency crisis late 1997. in view urgent need prompt financial sector restructuring, imf recommend setting-up integrate financial supervisory agency korean government. an mou consequently draw concern establishment december 1997. the national assembly late month pass necessary legislation remove bank supervision function bok establish integrate financial supervisory body. this duly set april 1998. the bok consequently lose bank supervisory function. some 650 member work bank supervisory field move new integrate agency. in tandem passage new legislation financial supervisory system, bank korea act revise give central bank great degree independence monetary policy. previously finance minister chairman central bank’s policy-setting body. under revise act, central bank governor become chairman. consequently, policy set body, monetary policy committee, able make decision monetary policy without prior consultation government. overview integrate financial supervisory system now, i would like move explain work integrate financial supervisory system present form. the korean financial supervisory agency make financial supervisory commission(fsc) financial supervisory service(fss). the fsc collegiate administrative body control prime minister. it supreme decision-making organ relation financial supervision examination. a such, authority direct operation f exercise surveillance it. the commission consist nine members, chairman appoint president three-year term. it serve secretariat make public officials. under fsc’s direction, fss, non-governmental organization special juridical person capital, supervise examine financial institutions. the chairman fsc serf concurrently governor fss. in meantime, bok, mofe korea deposit insurance corporation(kdic) exercise limit supervisory function relation business fall within particular area competence. for part, bok right request individual bank institution submit material business check actual management status. it may also require f examine bank institution staff participate joint basis examinations. another 2 bi review 13/2004 connection deputy governor bok serf ex-officio member fsc. consequently, take part decision-making process concern financial supervisory policy. to perform task efficiently, bok establish bank institution department, currently comprise staff 57. the mofe right present draft bill relate finance supervision national assembly. it is, however, require consult fsc propose revise legislation. the kdic, meanwhile, right investigate business status asset financial institution think danger failure. like bok, right request f undertake examination financial institution allow staff take part joint examination body. 3. evaluation current financial supervisory system six year pass since integrate financial supervisory body establish korea. during period, korean financial industry undergo intensive far-reaching restructuring. the number bank fell 19 today 33 december 1997. the number bank employee meanwhile decline 30 percent. non-banking financial institution experience equally dramatic process restructuring. the integrate supervisory agency highly rat role help overcome currency crisis improve soundness financial institution swift consistent restructure financial industry. it able concentration supervisory authority information. also, gather comprehensive information kind financial activities, inter-linkage consistency supervisory activity increased. on hand, grey area supervision, exist multiple-regulatory structure, largely eliminated. however, increase concern conflict interest prudential regulation supervisory agency macro-economic policy mofe might limit efficient implementation supervision policies. the threat insolvency number credit card company recently become potential source risk financial market stability. there suspicion quarter reason fsc unable nip loom insolvency problem bud lax supervision credit card company influence mofe want boost domestic demand. with regard problem, question adjustment function mofe, fsc f recently come discussion. 4. response bank korea new financial supervisory system now i would like tell bank korea come live new financial supervisory system. a know, central bank need wide range up-to-the-minute information financial market carry monetary policy also perform function lender last resort. though strip bank supervisory function, bok give statutory right request managerial information bank ask f examine bank joint basis. it also ask f examine bank specific area concern central bank. in actual practice, though, bok considerable difficulty gather information. bank often take negative attitude toward bok’s demand managerial information. moreover, bok right demand information non-bank financial institutions. under circumstances, bok prevail upon f provide material report file financial institutions. this january, bok, fss, kdic agree memorandum understand provide dramatic increase information share among them. bi review 13/2004 3 this mean central bank able collect managerial information bank non-bank financial institutions. another area concern on-site examination check banks’ managerial status. in early days, f reluctant accept bok’s request bank examination, even though legally stipulate f accept bok’s demand bank examination. in 2002, f go far turn bok’s demand joint examination. this clash spur two organization draw memorandum understand october 2002 hard negotiation. under it, f must accept bok’s demand joint examination provide mpc decide necessary. the arrangements, nonetheless, suffer limitation bank option stick fss’s examination schedule. it still impossible bok hold on-site examination judge warranted. it big issue whether give bok power independent examination, even time reform financial supervisory system 1997. on occasion, bok take position free examine bank discretion. the national assembly, however, accept government’s argument bok examine bank independently fss, burden financial institution might heavy joint examination hold bok join fss’s on-site examination. under present joint examination system, f examine general matter regard financial institutions’ managerial soundness. for part, bok examine limit area relate monetary policy payment settlement system. the two institutions, meanwhile, pool information gather course on-site examination, draw respective operations. there one issue concern financial stability efficiency, although directly relate bank supervision. that need strengthen central bank’s oversight national payment settlement system. the case constantly advocate multilateral financial institution bi imf. in regard, bok give authority oversee various payment settlement system korea recent revision bank korea act september 2003. under revise legislation, bok may demand relevant material bank non-bank financial institution take part bok-wire, real time gross settlement system operate bok. it may also request improvement payment settlement system operate entities. all mean bok come play many role order secure financial market stability spite limit official power financial supervision. 5. conclude remark let indicate point central banker may wish bear mind experience follow integration financial supervisory agency contemplate reorganization national financial supervisory framework. firstly, light countries’ example korea’s experience, i think one-size-fits-all supervisory system optimal every country. in particular, i think various alternative option regard issue central bank’s supervisory function. these depend degree financial market development nation’s tradition relate division role government central bank. and i think rest financial system characteristic particular country whether go integrate financial supervisory body multiple supervisory agency various type financial institution. secondly, absolutely essential central bank obtain wide range information financial market management status financial institution whether responsible bank supervision. where separate bank supervisory agency exists, system co-operation must build necessary information collect promptly. it also desirable central bank authority conduct on-site examination financial institution independently may obtain necessary information high degree market instability. 4 bi review 13/2004 bi review 13/2004 5 thirdly, vital set system policy coordination opinion central bank reflect supervisory policy financial supervisory agency. prudential supervision closely relate monetary policy. if financial supervisory agency strengthen prudential supervision, may bring similar effect tighten monetary policy. therefore i think crucial supervisory agency require consult central bank revision prudential regulations. what more, central bank should, necessary, right ask supervisory agency adjust prudential regulations. korea’s current supervisory system introduce haste extraordinary situation prevail aftermath currency crisis six year ago. therefore, friction institution concern financial supervision. in course time, shortcoming make good considerable extent, mind number area still call improvement. draw remark close, i venture hope korea’s experience may serve useful reference member country discuss reorganization financial supervisory systems. thank much listen attentively. edward m gramlich: budget trade deficit - linked, worrisome long run, twin remark mr edward m gramlich, member board governor u federal reserve system, euromoney bond investor congress, london, 25 february 2004. * * * thank invite speak today. while i know would welcome insight i might current u.s. monetary policy - whether open market committee raise low interest rate next meet - i prefer focus instead issue could become serious long run. these issue involve persistent budget trade deficit face american economy, issue could eventually involve significant economic adjustment around world.1 large budget trade deficit new phenomenon. they also arise unite state mid-1980s. at time, business press many economist begin refer situation one “twin deficits.” with current re-emergence deficits, phrase come back common usage - common, view. to sure, theoretical model scenario budget deficit create trade deficits, one trade deficit create budget deficits. but also many scenario either deficit arise independently, even budget trade deficit move opposite directions, 1990s. in general, budget trade deficit linked, important difference two, respond economic force long-run consequences. i start examine relationship budget trade deficit - link twins. i discus sustainability condition budget trade deficits; condition must fulfil debt account stabilize relation size u.s. economy. then i discus happen either debt violate condition rise relation size economy. this discussion, turn, raise interest distinction two deficits. the link the link budget trade deficit see naturally national income account framework. any save nation finance either private domestic investment directly accumulation claim foreigners. this mean national save - sum private government save - equal private domestic investment plus period’s accumulation claim foreigners, trade surplus. the trade surplus also think net foreign lending. all relationship account identity - true every moment time apart data inconsistency capture statistical discrepancy. in equation form, n = s – bd = i – td (1) on leave side equation n refer national saving, s refer overall private saving, bd refer government budget deficit. this part equation say merely total national save equal sum save do economy private sector government sector. a budget surplus would treat governmental save add private saving; budget deficit would treat governmental dissaving subtracted. the right side equation repeat familiar open economy identity national save equal private domestic investment, i, plus accumulation claim foreigner le domestic investment finance foreigners. a note earlier, borrow foreigner involve either reduction claim increase claim u them. it definition equal 1 a talks, i speak member federal reserve board federal open market committee. bi review 12/2004 1 trade deficit td. in equation, then, trade surplus mean national save go build claim foreigner (national save great domestic investment) trade deficit mean investment finance foreigner (national save le domestic investment). this identity first demonstrate all-important role national save shape long-run economic welfare. national save way country capital too. model economic growth process identify national save one key policy variable influence nation’s live standard long run. the identity also make clear budget deficit trade deficit move together dollar-per-dollar basis, difference private domestic investment private save constant. typically difference constant. for example, investment boom, interest rate might rise induce new private save new lend foreigners. the imply trade deficit might rise and, rise income, budget deficit might fall. in case, trade deficit would increase budget deficit fell. conversely, suppose expansionary fiscal policy result rise budget deficits. if expansion totally finance borrow foreigners, domestic interest rate would change much, domestic investment private save might either. in scenario, could simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change budget trade deficit - classic twin-deficit scenario. such situation likely occur small economy fully open international trade capital flows, economy domestic interest rate determine world capital market independent domestic economic variables. but domestic interest rate change, likely would either close economy large open economy, private investment save would also likely change, strict link budget trade deficit would broken. one could spin number scenarios, enough make basic point. because underlie relationship save investment, budget trade deficit could strictly linked. but large open economy like unite states, easy imagine plenty scenario imperfectly linked, even scenario move opposite directions. budget trade deficit view linked, twins. stability condition although economic implication reaction budget deficit trade deficit differ, deficits. another elementary account identity say last period’s debt level plus current deficit equal current period’s debt level. this identity true whether talk budget deficit build stock outstanding government debt (a liability government sector private sector), trade deficit build stock external debt (the net stock accumulate foreign claim unite states).2 economist worry year optimal stock government external debt. for government debt, optimal stock turn relate optimal level national saving, define level maximize nation’s long-term path consumption per worker. the optimal stock net external debt determine framework open economy perspective. while model instructive, today i go focus weak standard. whatever long-term optimal level government debt, whatever optimal level external debt, one separately ask whether either debt level become more, less, important economic factor time. for government debt, weak standard, stability condition, determine merely whether ratio debt gross domestic product (gdp) stable. if is, interest payment debt will, equilibrium, also settle stable proportion gdp. for external debt, stable debt-to-gdp ratio mean net interest dividend payment unite state foreign investor also settle constant ratio gdp. the appendix derive stability condition generically. it (g – i)/(1 + g) = p, (2) 2 both debt stock would also include valuation adjustment deal capital gain losses. 2 bi review 12/2004 stable ratio debt gdp, g nominal growth rate economy, nominal interest rate economy, p ratio primary deficit gdp. for budget accounts, primary deficit national income account budget deficit, exclude interest payments. for trade accounts, primary trade deficit current account deficit, exclude net interest dividend payment foreigners.3 a general rule, economy’s growth rate interest rate fairly close. the equation say equal, primary deficit must zero stabilize debt-to-gdp ratio. if interest rate slightly growth rate, would model without risk economy save le theoretical optimum, nation outstanding debt would run slight primary surplus stabilize debt-to-gdp ratio. if effective interest rate debt slightly growth rate, generally find past deficits, nation outstanding debt could run slight primary deficit see debt ratio grow.4 on foreign side, condition especially forgiving. even large net debt position, net investment income foreigner exceed pay foreigners. since net interest rate le gdp growth rate, ratio external debt gdp could stabilize moderate primary trade deficit.5 magnitude it well know u.s. economy suffer budget trade deficits. but deficit compare stability conditions? historically, significant instability u.s. federal budget deficits.6 overall deficit average 2 percent gdp past four decades, figure 1 show interest deducted, primary budget deficit average close zero, approximate level stabilize debt-to-gdp ratio. hence, outstanding debt, fluctuate range 25 percent 50 percent gdp, actually decline slightly share gdp. it 38 percent gdp mid-1960s 37 percent gdp. the ratio rise high 50 percent high-deficit year early 1990s, drop sharply thereafter primary budget surplus late 1990s. look ahead, thing might favorable. a result recent fiscal changes, budget lately fall primary deficit again; primary deficit 2 percent gdp (1.5 percent cyclical adjustment). the deterioration reflect much-discussed recent rapid growth expenditures, along significant tax cuts. perhaps significant, year unite state face huge loom cost retirement health programs. it take extraordinary fiscal discipline keep present primary deficit near current level 1 2 percent gdp short, medium, long run. and even level, stability condition violate least 1 percent gdp, suggest debt-to-gdp ratio likely climb steadily upward.7 3 this primary trade deficit differ trade deficit component gdp mention early include foreign transfer small items. 4 laurence ball, douglas w. elmendorf, n. gregory mankiw, “the deficit gamble”, journal money, credit, banking, vol. 30, no. 4, (november 1998), pp. 699-720, show interest rate domestic government debt generally slightly le gdp growth rate past decades. 5 the rate-of-return puzzle turn question foreign direct investment unite state low rate return. see raymond j. mataloni, jr., “an examination low rate return foreign-owned u.s. companies”, survey current business, vol. 80 (march 2000), pp. 55-73. 6 even though previous identity refer consumption budget entire government sector, section i switch familiar concept total budget u.s. federal government. state local government le finance current spend much outstanding debt apart back capital formation; federal capital investment small. 7 these statement base estimate congressional budget office, the budget economic outlook, fiscal year 2005 2014 (january 2004). a discussion long-run budget outlook find alan j. auerbach, william g. gale, peter r. orszag, samara r. potter, “budget blues: the fiscal outlook option reform,” henry j. aaron, jam lindsay, pietro nivola (eds.), agenda nation (the brook institution, 2003). see also general account office, truth transparency: the federal government’s financial condition fiscal outlook bi review 12/2004 3 on trade side, figure 2 show trend definitely worrisome. while budget debt fluctuate 25 percent 50 percent gdp past several decades, net external debt grow steadily. until 1985, external debt even positive; is, time unite state net claim foreigners. but unite state run persistent sizable primary trade deficit since 1990, net external debt 25 percent gdp rise sharply. the primary trade deficit 5 percent gdp, violate stability condition nearly amount. at rate, external debt ratio climb quickly. while trade deficit equilibrate tendencies, discuss later, also force tend increase it. econometric study basic demand import export find u.s. income elasticity demand import high foreign income elasticity demand u.s. exports. this mean even world economy grow rate u.s. economy, trade deficit likely widen, (apart change relative prices).8 indeed, u.s. primary trade deficit widen steadily since 1990. adjustment i argue u.s. violation stability condition budget trade deficit - recently moderately budget side, persistently significantly trade side. what implications? with deficit probably credibility range. by that, i mean limit range within country may able violate stability condition debt-to-gdp ratio trend upward without economic consequences. for budgets, may range within debt-to-gdp ratio grow without significant change interest rates.9 a equation 1 indicates, economic performance range mean optimal, persistent deficit subtract fund would otherwise devote capital investment future growth live standards. but may significant relative price effects. the true trade side; could range foreign claim unite state build without major impact relative prices. once economy get outside credibility range, significant relative price adjustment become likely. on trade side, example, continue accumulation foreign claim u.s. economy raise issue whether foreign investor want hold ever-increasing share wealth form u.s. assets. or, focus stability condition above, whether u.s. economy indefinitely pay ever-higher share gdp form interest dividend payments. the conventional view point relative price adjustment - combination rise u.s. interest rate (to make u.s. asset attractive), rise foreign price (to make import expensive), moderate u.s. price (to make u.s. export competitive), change exchange rates. each reaction likely occur naturally, move direction low external imbalance. that foreign trade deficit typically think self-correcting. the main risk natural adjustment may occur gradually, rapidly threaten various type dislocations. there complicate factors. one involve currency denomination net debt. country large trade deficit often external liability denominate foreign currency. hence, currency depreciates, value burden foreign debt automatically increases. the unite state problem debt denominate dollar - say, foreign hold u.s. treasury bills. if dollar fall, value debt term foreign currency would automatically decline, induce foreign wealth-holders make portfolio shifts, perhaps even include increase stock dollar-denominated debt. this (september 17, 2003) rudolph g. penner c. eugene steuerle, budget crisis door (the urban institute, october 2003). 8 see, example, peter hooper, karen johnson, jaime marquez, “trade elasticity g-7 countries”, princeton study international economics, vol. 87, (august 2000). 9 even claim may overoptimistic. see, example, thomas laubach, “new evidence interest rate effect budget deficit debt,” finance economics discussion series work paper (april 2003). among things, laubach interest way remove cyclical effect dependent variables, interest rates. 4 bi review 12/2004 denomination effect would permanently prevent relative price adjustment, could lengthen process. beyond that, pragmatic reason conventional adjustment process could extend distort even further. by way illustration, asian central bank accumulate trillion dollar international currency reserve - largely dollar-denominated asset - equal roughly half outstanding net debt unite states. these central bank traditional wealth-holders motivate expect risk returns. instead, seem motivate prospect preserve low domestic currency value exporters.10 to pursue objective, print money buy u.s. securities. this monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless sterilize open market sale security - mere scale present expect future debt stock may make continue sterilization impossible. but central bank continue behave way, so-called credibility range could extend significantly. while trade deficit ultimately correct themselves, perhaps long trek credibility range, really natural self-corrective mechanism budget deficits. once u.s. economy get credibility range, interest rate increase government debt rise induce people hold debt. this rise increase interest burden cause total deficit rise further, time subtract fund capital accumulation. once process begins, market psychology may hasten adjustment.11 hence, natural force lessen basic external imbalance, increase basic budget imbalance. in long run, way correct budget deficit policymakers correct them. outside force there several outside force - natural result policy - could influence budget trade deficits. one generally helpful influence productivity growth. say u.s. economy benefit exogenous positive shock productivity growth, seem late 1990s. this shock would raise trend path income, mean slightly high primary budget trade deficit could still consistent debt-to-gdp stability; effect, high level g plug equation 2 (at least long offset high i). high productivity could also help lengthen credibility range, range moderate change debt ratio might lead adverse change relative prices. among things, high productivity could raise marginal product capital make investment u.s. asset relatively attractive. but even favorable developments, stability condition discuss still hold. if violated, natural adjustment mechanism eventually take trade deficit, primary budget deficit eventually reduce stop grow government debt ratio. one unhelpful measure trade protectionism. while might appear trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, probably not. over medium long run, economy produce near natural growth path, perhaps timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps natural equilibrate force economy. in event, trade protectionism would stimulate add national production. even protectionist measure reduce imports, add spend demand import-competing industry crowd type production. put another way, equation 1 show trade deficit ultimately determine national save investment. without change these, protectionism merely shift type good produced. it increase overall production and, short cut trade altogether, even change trade balance. moreover, well known, long run, trade protection low nation’s standard living. finally, suppose politician actually correct budget deficits, assume economy near medium-term growth path. a mention above, fiscal austerity policy know way 10 this view give michael dooley, david folkerts-landau, peter garber, “an essay revive bretton wood system”, nber work paper 9971 (national bureau economic research, september 2003). 11 an argument market psychology hasten adjustment give robert e. rubin, peter r. orszag, allen sinai “sustained budget deficits: large run u economic performance risk financial fiscal disarray,” paper present meet american economic association (san diego, california, january 4, 2004). bi review 12/2004 5 correct persistent budget deficits. the reduction deficit low domestic interest rate trigger change exchange rate low import raise exports. hence, well-designed fiscal austerity measure could solve problem simultaneously. they correct budget deficit directly, reduce trade deficit indirectly, imply high level national save also permit fund flow capital formation long-term productivity enhancements. fiscal austerity one try true approach deal budget trade deficit simultaneously. conclusion there obviously strong link budget trade deficits, deficit-debt dynamic relationship similar. at time, mislead simply equate two deficits, often do twin-deficit literature. budget deficit typically involve reduction national save and, large, steadily grow government debt-to-gdp ratio. they typically correct without explicit action. trade deficits, hand, typically involve increase foreign claim u.s. economy. a claim grow relation national income, least natural force set motion correct imbalance. from policy standpoint, neither deficit may terribly harmful short run, least recent fiscal deficit useful stabilize movement output. moreover, likely credibility range debt level could rise relative gdp without much change relative prices. in long run, however, deficit could become much worrisome. there force tend increase deficits: political demographic budget deficits, income elasticity trade deficits. at point, continue large-scale trade deficit could trigger equilibrating, possibly dislocating, change prices, interest rates, exchange rates. continue budget deficit steadily detract growth u.s. capital stock may also trigger dislocate changes. 6 bi review 12/2004 appendix: derivation stability condition let p denote primary deficit (for either budget trade), d debt either, nation’s

olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual meet charlotte regional partnership, charlotte, north carolina, 15 june 2004. * * * i please opportunity share think require maintain economic environment business like find conducive investment job creation. i note view own; i speak colleague federal open market committee. over second half last year, u.s. economy gather strength, performance far year suggest make transition sustained, broad-based expansion. household spend new homebuilding continue move up, business appear shed good deal uncertainty caution time weigh decision upgrade capital hire workers. real business spend new equipment software first quarter year 12-1/2 percent level year earlier, more-recent data indicate manufacturer continue book new order capital good solid pace. the upturn hire particularly encouraging; january may, private nonfarm establishment add almost 1.2 million jobs. we see string monthly increase like four years. to sure, monetary fiscal policy play key role strengthen aggregate demand past year. accommodative monetary policy raise price household asset low cost finance new home durable good reduction personal tax boost disposable income. businesses, too, benefit more-accommodative financial environment. low interest rate reduce short-term borrow cost combine narrow risk spread keep longer-term corporate borrow cost attractive. the extend period low interest rate allow firm refinance high-cost debt substitute long-term debt short-maturity debt improve balance sheet liquidity. on fiscal front, firm able take advantage temporary partial-expensing tax provision. at time, impressive effort business make control cost increase productivity pay strong rebound profitability cash flow. the combination balance sheet restructure strong profitability allow corporate america achieve high level liquidity decade. a i note moment ago, i find recent recovery hire particularly welcome indication business become confident durability expansion. last year, economic activity begin pick up, recovery remain even “jobless” recovery early 1990s. a good deal monetary fiscal stimulus place, expect time show pickup real economic activity. but firm unusually reluctant make commitment take new worker atmosphere cloud risk uncertainty associate war iraq fallout lapse corporate governance. my sense, informal contact business bank community available survey business attitudes, confidence recover noticeably year. other explanation sluggish recovery employment 2002 2003 focus development may last effect labor market. first, recovery seem mark unusual degree ability business achieve labor-saving efficiency gains. recall begin detect improvement productivity second half 1990s. the rate increase output per hour nonfarm business sector move 1-1/2 percent per year 1973 1995 2-1/2 percent per year 1996 2000. that acceleration appear largely result brisk business investment. since then, even slump capital spend 2001 early 2003, productivity rise stun annual rate 4 percent. one strike feature recent acceleration gain efficiency seem result organizational change innovation use exist resource -perhaps part result learn good apply new technology acquire rapid pace late 1990s. bi review 37/2004 1 during early part expansion, aggregate demand remain weak, especially rapid gain efficiency allow business meet sale production goal without add workers. but pace expansion step past several quarters, begin see sustain advance output per hour gain jobs. i suspect productivity eventually slow extraordinary pace past couple year - indeed, recent figure offer evidence slow already occurred. nonetheless, i optimistic part step-up productivity growth sustain reinforce renew upturn capital spending. continue solid gain productivity important plus economy long run fast increase productivity lead time high profits, wages, standard living. the jobless recovery also lead economist debate extent lack hire overall continue decline manufacture job specifically represent structural changes, is, change likely reverse recovery strengthened. specifically, great deal attention focus loss international competitiveness, foreign outsourcing, relocation job overseas subsidiaries. although change are, indeed, natural consequence globalization, considerable evidence small part large story. the ongoing turnover job dynamic economy considerable. the estimate staff assemble speech early year duke university federal reserve board colleague ben bernanke indicate that, past decade, gross private-sector job loss u.s. economy likely amount 15 million per year, include seasonal short-term layoffs.1 estimate job lose import account slightly 2 percent total. more important, course, job creation side churn process even large - roughly 17 million job per year. give total number private-sector job 108 million, average year job gain loss represent 30 percent total. certainly, charlotte region familiar dynamic process job creation destruction. in 1990, charlotte-gastonia-rock hill metropolitan area relatively dependent fortune manufacture sector. the area almost 150,000 manufacture jobs, represent almost one-fourth area’s employment; contrast, job professional business service account 10 percent area’s employment, roughly 60,000 jobs. ten year later, picture dramatically different: largely cutback textile mills, charlotte metropolitan area lose almost 20,000 factory jobs. but, time, employment professional business service double roughly equal number manufacture job exist 2000. employment education, health, leisure also expand rapidly. certainly, broad distribution employment recent year help area weather recession generally and, specifically, continue loss textile job import competition. you also witness first-hand globalization work two ways. a know experience attract foreign-owned company region, u.s. worker also benefit good deal “insourcing.” nationwide, employment u.s. worker affiliate foreign firm 5.5 million 2000-2002 period - 1.7 million ten year earlier. although globalization clearly result real hardship worker certain industries, remain generally essential component economic growth encourage innovation promote efficiency high standard living. place restriction international trade would, long run, counterproductive; consumer would likely end pay high price consumer goods, business might lose opportunity productive arise environment open trade. the appropriate policy approach promote maximum job creation ease transition worker catch painful inevitable shift mix job opportunities. an important feature ongoing structural change economy increase demand skilled workers, arise shift industrial composition job upgrade

work done. now expansion seem take hold, face challenge make transition policy stance appropriate sustain economic expansion. our goal way maximize economic growth sustain significant progress make

economy financial system. the fund provide useful voice forum advise major economy pursue policy contribute good global economic expansion financial stability. the fund play important role considering, global systemic perspective, exchange rate policy members. and fund play vital role provide macroeconomic policy framework critical sustain good growth outcome effectiveness global

abrupt change financial market condition exchange rates, never decisive arena. and might improve design macroeconomic policy institution poor develop countries. but outside areas, challenge sustain growth per caput income lie largely area beyond core competence imf. in emerge market context, contrast, great distance fund today achievable frontier. this timely critical issue, magnitude challenge still confront many emerge market economies. let start broad review progress make past decade across emerge market reduce vulnerability financial crisis. • international reserve increase

reserve cushions, strong external positions, improve balance sheets, flexible exchange rate regimes, good inflation performance provide different set exist last time face transition sustain period benign financial condition low interest rates. these aggregate improvement mask substantial difference across country number area linger vulnerability. let highlight some, suggest implication fund might good position deal challenge present. • some daunt challenge fiscal public debt area, number emerge market economy across different region face high, case still grow public sector debt levels. average public debt burden emerge world rise 70 percent gdp, among country rat single b below, mean rise 80 percent. • the challenge manage debt burden size magnify fact debt structure number country

room fiscal policy help cushion effect shock. 2 bi review 37/2004 • important challenge remain financial area well. in many countries, large public sector debt burden leave bank system highly expose sovereign, constrain authorities’ room maneuver. there also problem banks’ corporate consumer loan books, number bank system also large share foreign currency denominate liabilities, case hold non-residents. • the durability recent improvement external positions, reflect weak domestic demand many countries, also open question. a domestic demand strengthens, external balance could move

long time reverse. they legacy year past fiscal decisions, magnify impact crisis growth, exchange rate, financial sector. they leave exact set policy challenges. they raise risk future shock domestic confidence adverse change external environment could lead new pressure exchange rates, interest rates, capacity country fund sustainable terms. apart risk crisis, debt level large enough depress domestic investment long-term growth prospects. in part balance sheet debt burdens, many emerge market economy face protract transition expect comfortably consider stable investment grade credits, sufficient level self-insurance external domestic challenge financial stability. one press challenge fund help assist process reduce vulnerability, promote unwind large balance sheet risk and, time, provide credible form contingent insurance hopefully rare circumstance member face extraordinary finance needs. the fund would good able contribute process strengthen policy number specific areas. my suggestion cover four type reforms: change substantive focus fund policy advice; relationship fund member surveillance framework; fund’s approach country undertake debt restructuring; fund us financial resources. they involve adopting: risk base approach focus fund’s crisis prevention work; intensive framework surveillance process provide strong anchor member’s economic program; reinforce framework provide support country undertake debt restructuring; credible form financial insurance create good incentive strong policy advance crisis. these proposal require amend article agreement fund, achieve without major change structure institution. they evolutionary rather revolutionary. more policy ambition study imf staff, imf’s independent evaluation office, others catalogue number criticism substantive content fund’s policy advice. many study conclude fund insufficient ambition prescription reform number case deferential domestic political constraint adjustment reform. some conclude supportive choice member run exchange rate regime incompatible rest policy framework, lead substantial appreciation real effective exchange rate time, encourage borrow foreign currency, prove brittle stress. some suggest fund case insufficiently attentive ineffective address increase debt, particularly foreign exchange denominate link debt, create balance sheet problems, make crisis damage difficult resolve. it accommodated, supported, decision member calibrate policy design benign external environment realistic therefore encourage le self-insurance necessary manage safely. and draw far range efficiency-improving long-term institutional reform necessarily diffuse attention critical vulnerabilities. bi review 37/2004 3 to extent, criticism suffer classic failure claim seem obvious hindsight clear time. many unfair degree influence expect fund able exert reluctant member - recall constraint i describe begin fund’s power members. and many criticism fail recognize difficulty make definitive judgement path policy consistent sustainability. yet element general diagnosis fund’s policy advice emerge market economy substantial merit. if fund go contribute process well-targeted reform, particularly vulnerable countries, probably need raise bar, increase level ambition policy recommendations. great policy focus require principal source near-term vulnerability, ideally without fully eclipse longer-term institution build structural reform important raise growth potential. a risk-based framework determine hierarchy policy priority important. such framework would almost certainly entail focus unwind large balance sheet problem (both respect sovereign financial system), reduce sovereign debt sustainable levels, make debt dynamic le vulnerable shocks, increase liquidity buffers, preserve appropriate exchange rate arrangements. address issue would help reduce risk future capital account crises. it would create good condition private sector growth. in virtually every context public sector debt burden high fiscal deficit large, ambition adjustment path positive growth effect confidence, interest rates, exchange rate. of course fund can’t want reform members. the principal burden run set policy commensurate risk emerge market face world rest governments. the role fund help guide encourage point build substantial degree self-insurance. the fund acquiesce validate policy framework fall substantially short threshold necessary safely navigate world high variability external environment occasional domestic political pressure weaken policies. change surveillance framework part challenge entail reorient surveillance, process fund’s policy advice delivered, make effective. the surveillance framework today number feature make poorly suit small open emerge market economy fragile credibility, limit buff shocks, considerable exposure rapidly change economic financial environment. the assessment occur quite infrequently, every 12 24 months. the assessment publish approval member state, tend take edge diagnosis prescriptions. assessment come clear evaluation relative threshold help define degree vulnerability, relative country similar circumstances. the assessment judgment fund’s executive board, formally staff, also work take edge candid economic financial judgments. risk clearly candidly identify explored. and process come consequences, since critical evaluation withhold public, neither favorable critical evaluation necessarily consequence access financial assistance fund. the model use bank supervision unite state

profile institution risk management control infrastructure. we ass model bank use measure risk scenario use stress test exposures, bank responsibility design run risk management infrastructure. by look across broad range world class financial institutions, good sense evolve frontier best practice risk management use help benchmark institution pull common practice close frontier. for number reasons, can’t model fund’s relationship members. but provide interest prism think surveillance. the fund explore number idea strengthen surveillance framework. one promise establish process frequent, publish staff assessment performance medium-term framework design member country. that assessment could convey 4 bi review 37/2004 clear judgement degree progress make reduce vulnerabilities, improve resilience, strengthen structural underpinnings growth. analysis public external debt trends, benchmarked sustainability vulnerability thresholds, stress test relevant shock could play key role process. there compel argument combine framework contingent access fund resources. surveillance today provide meaningful check ex ante policies, resource make available financial need acute. access supplemental resource fund precautionary contingent basis could make critical difference prevent short-term liquidity crisis become full-scale solvency problem lead default. of course, access contingent finance limit country whose policy judge reasonably sustainable, consistent reduction balance sheet risk time. with enhance surveillance framework design help keep policy strong path reduce risk time, contingent finance could mobilize quickly, fund would good position contain risk deep financial crisis. and policy reform necessary accompaniment fund finance resource could support ex

second, fund commit support, country must develop, consultation advisors, outline fund creditors, credible monitorable framework cooperatively achieve viable debt restructuring, one leaf country

monetary policy: central banker’s perspective speech mr christian noyer, governor bank france, morgan stanley seminar index bonds, paris, 9 june 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, [dear friends], it great pleasure address context first “séminaire de paris” inflation-linked security organise morgan stanley. today, i focus specifically “the role inflation - index bond process set monetary policy” central banker’s perspective, base experience former vice-president ecb current governor banque de france. throughout presentation, i occasionally refer monetary policy strategy framework implement eurosystem asset prices, particular inflation-indexed government bonds, play role context economic analysis. have say this, i neither elaborate ecb’s framework comment last govern council’s monetary policy decision. price indexation financial contract new phenomenon. accord robert shiller1, world’s first know inflation-indexed bond issue commonwealth massachusetts 1780 revolutionary war. these bonds, so-called “depreciation notes”, issue u soldier defer compensation services. they mainly design deal severe wartime inflation. although bond successful, concept index bond set aside 20th century. finland introduce index bond 1945, sweden 1952, iceland israel 1955. since then, index bond usually appear country experience high rate inflation, brazil 19642, chile (1966), colombia (1967), argentina (1972) even uk 1975, issuance so-called “granny bonds”, i.e. non-marketable indexed-linked save retirement certificates. late on, 1981, uk issue marketable instrument - index-linked gilt- context rapidly increase prices. in cases, issuance inflation-indexed debt instrument government aim develop long-term capital market improve credibility anti-inflationary policies. a regard last point, rationale is, however, ambiguous also argue debt indexation fuel inflationary process spread inflation-linking contracts, wage contract instance. give historical background, might appear paradoxical that, since 1980, index bond largely issue industrialise countries, characterise low inflation rate price stability - orient monetary policies: australia (1985), canada (1991), sweden (1994), new zealand (1995), the unite state (1997), france (1998 2001) recently italy greece (2003). the rationale behind issuance index bond mainly reduce cost debt develop complete financial markets. from central banker’s standpoint, role asset price general inflation-indexed bond particular process set monetary policy mainly relate information content future economic activity inflation. a already probably noticed, govern council ecb sometimes refer information deliver change inflation-indexed bond yield introductory statement comprehensive assessment recent economic financial developments, presented, instance, ecb’s monthly bulletin. to elaborate this, i develop three points. first, i describe information content inflation-indexed bond explain information relevant central banks. second, i highlight main drawback potential bias may alter information content. third, i briefly review indicator variable also use cross-check exercise euro area level. finally, i conclude presentation raise issue i call 1 robert shiller: “the invention inflation - index bond early america”, nber work paper n°10183, december 2003. 2 in year prior introduction index bond, inflation rate 69.2% brazil, 22.2% chile, 19.7% colombia, 34.8% argentina, 16,1% uk 1974 still 14% 1980. bi review 37/2004 1 “circularity problem”, difficulty encounter every central bank face signal extraction problem, particular try get information asset prices. let turn first point: 1. what information content inflation-indexed bond relevant central bank? over past decade, policy maker come rely long-term bond yield measure public’s long-term inflationary expectations. accord empirical research3, “almost 80% movement long nominal rate appear due change expect long-term inflation”. accord fisherian theory interest rates, long-term nominal interest rate depend upon ex-ante real interest rate expect long-term inflation, factor inflation risk premium. the main problem central bank that, practice, three component unobservable. in respect, central bank face signal extraction problem, important implication term monetary policy decision-making. i mention three them. first, aggregate spend decision generally view closely relate long-term [real] interest rates. this imply change short-term interest rates, use operational target implement monetary policy, affect aggregate spend decision impact long-term interest rates. under rationale, term-structure interest rate relationship long-term interest rate long-term expect inflation become central design monetary policy. second, inflation expectation may use policy maker gain information set short-term interest rates, whereas change nominal yield curve, use. an increase long-term nominal interest rate may drive rise long-term expect inflation rate rise inflation risk premium, may also reflect increase long-term real interest rates, drive real factors. the two first movement could justify change monetary policy stance, nature underlie shock likely duration clearly identified, change may inappropriate last case. third, information long-term inflation expectation provide monetary authority measure credibility commitment price stability. the existence market inflation-indexed security may provide central bank useful information, since may enable identify whether change nominal yield mainly reflect change expect long-term inflation rate rather whether due change real yields. if one assumes, instance, conventional bond market inflation-indexed bond market efficient arbitrage economic agent incorporate information real interest rate, difference conventional nominal rate real rate would provide, factor inflation risk premium, measure expect inflation rate period, know “break-even inflation rate”. now, nominal index bond across whole maturity spectrum, to, say, 30 year maximum maturity inflation-indexed bond currently issued, would able pin market expectation inflation forecast horizons, 30 years, well forecast inflation year maximum maturity. so easily imagine importance information central banks, information is, moreover, update daily basis. our staff also private forecaster unable routinely produce inflation forecast detail, frequency horizons! a far euro area concerned, reliability inflation-indexed yield break-even inflation rate strengthen significant development market index bond recent years, accelerate 2003 arrival two new government issuers: greece march italy september. if take account overall euro area inflation market, third big market term market capitalisation, behind unite state unite kingdom. however, 2003, fast grow market term 3 see barr, d.g. j.y. campbell (1996) : “inflation, real interest rate bond market: a study uk nominal index-linket government bond prices”, nber work paper, # 5821, november. 2 bi review 37/2004 issuance also large liquid inflation derivative market, characterise broad range product (government bonds, agency bonds, inflation swaps, etc.) large number frequent issuer (france, italy, greece, cades, cna, etc.). what eurosystem learn date inflation-indexed securities? first, since inception euro, long-term expect inflation, i.e. break-even inflation rate, derive french oat index bond french oatei - index euro area hicp - broadly stable range 1,7%-1,9%, i.e. broadly line ecb’s definition price stability, year-on year increase euro area hicp close to, below, 2% medium term. this could interpret sign ecb’s credibility illustration ability anchor inflation expectation fairly low level, consistent price stability. however, since third quarter 2003, break-even inflation rate hover around 2.2 - 2.3%, break ceiling define govern council ecb. in context rise oil price soar commodity prices, may reflect concern future price development euro area thus accelerate inflationary expectations. however, also anecdotal evidence demand index government bond insurance companies, pension hedge funds, increase slightly recent months, push price index bond and, consequently, real yield down. a result, break-even inflation rate may distort upward, reason directly relate change expect inflation. this latter point raise issue drawback potential bias affect index yields, increase difficulty interpret correctly decipher movement behind change nominal yields. i constitute second point presentation. 2. the bias break-even inflation rate. the break-even inflation rate may good measure expect inflation. it however cautiously interpret analyse may also severely biased. when i previously introduce concept break-even inflation rate, i assume efficient arbitrage market also perfect foresight risk liquidity premia. since seem unlikely hold practice, consider break-even inflation rate relate to, equal to, inflation expectations. let briefly outline bias need take account context economic financial assessment. for sake simplicity, i distinguish two main category biases: technical bias institutional biases, leave aside treatment risk aversion considerations, tend introduce upward bias break-even inflation rate. technical bias the compound convexity biases: definition break-even rate difference conventional nominal bond yield inflation - index bond yield first order approximation take account interest rate compounding. consequently, break-even rate upward bias estimator expect inflation - provide inflation expectation positive4. interest rate compound also another implication imply bond price respond asymmetric manner change yield: indeed, bond price sensitive fall yield increase yield, therefore, also rise volatility yield increases, therefore push forward rates5. the net convexity adjustment therefore bias break-even inflation rate either upward (the likely) downward. the inflation lag: construction, bond cash flow adjust instantaneously actual inflation. this imply break-even inflation rate include another bias reflect discrepancy lag contemporaneous inflation rate. for instance, case french index bonds, lag length limit three months, equivalent u tip canadian index government bond, slightly uk eight-month lag 4 to give magnitude order, real rate 4% expect inflation rate 2% would generate compound bias 8 basis point, practice fairly small. 5 this phenomenon know convexity bias. it grow maturity, compound increases, may vary across time, volatility yield also likely change time. there reason think convexity adjustment conventional forward curve index forward curve. bi review 37/2004 3 required. a consequence, real yield distorted, information content break-even inflation rate also affected. accord empirical research6, bias also estimate fairly small, around 5 basis points. liquidity bias: finally, conclude non exhaustive review technical biases, one also mention that, general, index bond relatively le liquid conventional government bonds. hold period seem long former also reflect relatively low trade volume inflation-indexed bonds. the existence liquidity premium result understatement level expect inflation derive break-even inflation rate. some in-house research suggest bias around 5 15 basis points. besides technical biases, institutional arrangement may also introduce distortion real yields, impact turn break-even inflation rate. i mention two examples. institutional bias the tax bias: main source distortion probably relate taxation. investor primarily interest real net-of-tax cash flows, imply difference tax treatment conventional index bond influence relative price therefore break-even inflation rate. in french case, inflation compensation gain interest rate income equally taxed, bias generally consider relatively small - le 10 basis points. but even small, constitute another upward distortion break-even. new regulation - supply demand factors: i mentioned, earlier, i conclude section point, french oati, far main inflation-indexed indicator use ecb economic financial assessment, distort significant upward demand shift be, certain extent, attribute adoption french bank finance regulation committee (crbf) new regulation livret a (passbook save vehicle), aim link save account partly inflation . anecdotal evidence suggest surge demand oati originate banks, try hedge new regulation. an insufficient outstanding amount french inflation linkers relative overall demand hedge purpose lead upward pressure price euro area linkers (greece italy). to conclude point, bias likely small, add together, potentially non-systematic way. they also likely vary time. it therefore difficult smooth noise get good proxy inflation expectation medium long-term. two main lesson may draw existence various premia bias affect break-even inflation rates. first, may informative focus change break-even rate rather levels. this however cost since level convey relevant information central bank. second, break-even inflation rate may provide interest information regard long-term inflation expectations, although necessary cross-check inflation expectations’ measures. this lead third final point. 3. other useful indicator expect inflation inflation-indexed bond sole financial instrument provide information long-term expectation inflation, similar information extract inflation-linked swaps. the market inflation-linked swap develop rapidly since 2002 euro area. company revenue link inflation may use market hedge perspective low inflation company liability link inflation may use hedge risk high inflation. compare inflation-indexed bonds, provide wide maturity spectrum short medium horizons. however, affect biases, particular inflation risk liquidity premia. this tool, however, usefully complement inflation-indexed bond eurosystem’s information set7 and, far, information provide new financial instrument broadly 6 see f. alonso, r. blanco a. del rio: “estimating inflation expectation use french government inflation-indexed bonds”, banco de espana, documento de trabajo, n° 0111, 2001. 7 see instance box entitle “deriving euro area inflation expectation inflation-linked swaps”, ecb monthly bulletin, september 2003. 4 bi review 37/2004 line information derive index bonds, suggest average ten-year expect inflation rate around 2%. in addition financial indicators, central banks, ecb particular, also rely heavily survey extract relevant information regard long-term inflation expectations. i limit two examples: the first quarterly survey carry ecb since 1999, information gather professional forecasters. in particular, survey inflation expectation medium term, 4-year horizon, deliver useful information since forecaster ask probability distribution inflation forecast horizon. it might complete survey look long horizons, consensus forecast instance. accord surveys, medium long-term expectation prove remarkably stable euro area, stand level around 1.8 - 1.9%, spite short-term inflation dynamic adversely affect series sizeable supply shock impact economy since 2000. another useful kind survey european commission’s harmonise survey price expectation individual households, complete set alternative measure inflation expectations. here, household ask whether expect price next 12 month rise le rapidly past 12 months. the time horizon short and, since 2000, survey deliver worrisome results. a divergence actually emerged, france euro area whole, actual inflation inflation perceive households. the proportion household feel price rise sharply substantially increased, without correlation actual development general price level. central bank must also avoid misperception reason, rely limit set indicator use comprehensive rigorous analysis aim picture economy complex permanently evolve system. central bank also difficult task identify shock hit economy address appropriately assess potential implication term risk price stability. model analysis, monetary analysis, model -based forecast additional useful tool employ context. this precisely approach take ecb, develop two-pillar-strategy order help sort wealth potentially conflict statistics. conclusion let briefly conclude remark ask question: information really get asset prices, particularly inflation - index securities? financial market indeed play critical role process set monetary policy. in effect, influence monetary policy real economy ultimately price largely transmit asset prices. a point blinder, economic activity directly affect change key policy rates, rather long-term interest rate and, relevant, wealth effects. in short, monetary policy affect economy interaction long-term expectations, turn affect asset price economic activity inflation. but central bank also rely financial market information help explain monetary policy decisions. this point sort “circularity problem” whereby unclear informative information extract asset price actually is. consider instance stable break-even inflation rate level close 2% euro area. then suppose that, sometimes observe financial market -as money market instance- reason, market indexed-bonds indeterminate sense market unable determine ex-ante equilibrium price. thank existence central bank, equilibrium price may however set issuer price-makers believe central bank commit price stability define year-on-year increase consumer price index around 2% medium run. the indexed-bond price set basis actual conventional bond price long-term nominal anchor define central bank, factor certain margin premia. this clearly indicate central bank’s credibility, stable break-even inflation rate reflect aspect. but else draw information take monetary policy decision? this might another illustration economist recently name “credibility paradox”. on one hand, information variable central bank consistent definition price stability: therefore cause concern. on hand, whatever underlie market’s bi review 37/2004 5 dynamics, economic agent convince central bank ensure price stability: credibility matters. in context, misperception side generate aggregate instability, characterise unsustainable market development emergence financial imbalances. this one reason central bank make use wide possible set information variable cope uncertainties. in context, asset prices, inflation - index bond play important role information variables; one bear mind endogenous monetary policy decision via expectation channel. thank attention. 6 bi review 37/2004 mark w olson: regulatory update - bank industry, insurance security activity remark mr mark w olson, member board governor u federal reserve system, bank insurance security association legislative, regulatory compliance seminar, washington dc, 10 june 2004. * * * introduction many thank bank insurance security association (bisa) invite speak afternoon. financial modernization, characterize ever-increasing ability financial service firm offer banking, securities, insurance products, introduce new challenge well new opportunities. from perspective federal reserve board, i’d like discus compliance risk-management issue bank organization begin new, expand existing, insurance sale activities. i’d also like offer observation “push-out” provision draft security exchange commission require certain securities-related activity previously conduct bank remove bank “pushed out” entity licensed, sec-regulated security broker-dealer. my comment today necessarily represent view fellow federal reserve board member federal reserve system. background follow enactment mccarran-ferguson act 1945, supervision insurance almost exclusively domain states. therefore, past century, - is, federal reserve state insurance supervisor - travel different circles. the federal reserve little insurance issue bank bank hold company generally involve credit-related insurance sale underwrite activities. in fact, federal legislation charge federal reserve supervise bank hold company - bank hold company act 1956 - enact large part prevent affiliation one large bank country large insurance underwriter. congress go strengthen separation bank insurance 1982 amendment act generally prohibit bank hold company engage insurance agency activities. the historic statutory separation bank insurance end november 1999 gramm-leach-bliley act (glb act), allow well-managed well-capitalized bank organization affiliate kind insurance underwriter insurance sale brokerage firm offer credit-related financial services, insurance pay loan event borrower’s death disability, mortgage guaranty insurance. to engage broad range insurance activities, bank hold company must qualify become financial hold company certify subsidiary bank well capitalize well managed, among criteria. a year-end 2003, 630 bank hold company foreign bank choose become financial hold companies. only 12 percent u.s. bank hold company become financial hold companies; however, financial hold company control 80 percent domestic bank industry’s assets. since enactment glb act, surprisingly bank organization take advantage expand insurance powers. about 25 percent financial hold company use new insurance powers, largely acquisition insurance agency brokerage firm or, instances, insurance underwriters. only financial hold company expand insurance activity significant way. anecdotal evidence suggest many financial hold company consider commence expand exist insurance sale and, less extent, insurance underwriting. the sale insurance bank organization make sense. insurance financial product many customer need. enter insurance market agent fit naturally nature banking. bank organization develop network system deliver financial product consumer - business model always require manufacture product. insurance increasingly view product stand own, important item bi review 36/2004 1 menu financial product help consumer create portfolio financial assets, manage financial risks, plan financial security well-being. many consumer find convenient purchase financial plan product single location offer full range financial services. thus, bank organization natural alternative sale channel insurance underwriter look expand customer base. compliance risk management issue with development come new challenges. while type risk common bank organization insurance companies, products, business practices, regulatory framework insurance industry outside experience many bank organizations. change bank financial service industry highlight importance incorporate assessment compliance risk evaluation bank organization’s overall risk profile enterprisewide risk-management program. in december 2003, augment federal reserve’s risk-focused supervision program, adopt policy emphasize importance compliance consumer protection regulation context overall bank safety soundness evaluations. examiner ass consumer compliance risk across broad range bank organization’s activity determine level trend consumer compliance risk. supervision consumer compliance examiner work together closely evaluate consumer compliance risk affect organization’s reputational, legal, operational risk profiles. supervisory plans, particularly large complex bank organizations, fully integrate consumer compliance review overall risk-focused safety soundness supervisory program. key issue bank bank hold company compliance risk manager address design update insurance annuity sale program • prevent conflict interest - ensure sale suitable light customer need appropriate alternative product adequately considered; • monitor consumer complaint regard sale practices, identify address trend issue may expose bank organization potential loss; • implement consumer protection sale insurance regulation, upon i elaborate moment; • ensure parent bank bank hold company place appropriate control account systems, include disaster recovery program relate insurance sale line business; • ensure bank bank hold company control protect privacy customer information, consistent relevant state regulations; • monitor claim potential exposure mistake - “errors omissions” - relate insurance sale brokerage activities, identify report bank organization management adverse trend potential significant legal exposures; • formal report board management regard risk associate insurance sale activity internal control use organization minimize potential loss risks. many issue cover detail federal reserve supervisory guidance. while i’ll discus one issues, i urge you, update compliance risk management programs, review consider issue describe federal reserve’s recently update supervisory guidance entitle “insurance sale activity consumer protection sale insurance,” contain commercial bank examination manual bank hold company inspection manual. the issue compliance area i’d like discus today conformity federal consumer protection rule require glb act bank sale insurance annuities. the consumer protection sale insurance regulation, rule refer to, issue interagency basis federal bank thrift regulators, effective october 2001. the federal bank thrift agency responsibility enforce relatively new regulations. the regulation require insurance credit disclosure consumer regard insurance sell 2 bi review 36/2004 solicit behalf bank. the insurance disclosures, among things, intend ensure consumer understand insurance product annuity sell bank insure federal deposit insurance corporation - disclosure similar require bank sale non-deposit investment products. the credit disclosure seek ensure consumer understand bank cannot “tie” loan purchase insurance product annuity bank affiliate. the federal regulation also generally prohibit certain deceptive sale practices. in addition, regulation limit fee may pay bank employee insurance annuity referral one-time, nominal fee base whether referral result sale insurance annuity product. while bank organizations, generally, attune new regulation implement appropriate controls, bank organization slow train staff appropriately, update internal procedures, provide adequate control ensure compliance regulations. such deficiency may expose institution reputational legal risk. sale incentive program award point toward nonmonetary prize significant value, vacation packages, base number insurance security product referral also may raise compliance issues. compliance staff closely review program ensure give bank employees, act behalf bank, reward insurance non-deposit investment product referrals, value exceed nominal one-time fee. while bank organization provide appropriate oversight insurance activities, important bank place formal mechanism report board senior management, regular intervals, regard identification assessment risk arise business activity status issue resolution. the insurance sale annuity line business run autopilot, even though may convenient simply business line new likely unfamiliar bank management board, manage “business line experts,” already review insurance underwriter functional regulator. a require glb act, federal reserve generally examine insurance underwriter insurance agency own bank hold company. instead, defer appropriate state insurance authorities. however, review, bank hold company level, appropriateness risk management internal control bank organization’s insurance annuity sale activities, ass level risk arise activities. to improve understand issue develop insurance industry, also establish resource center board federal reserve bank boston monitor development insurance industry. observation regard propose “push-out” provision before concluding, i’d like touch security side business. the glb act remove blanket exemption definition broke dealer federal security law many year enjoy banks. in exemption’s place, glb act provide specific exemption permit bank continue conduct security activity part provide traditional bank product services, include trust fiduciary, custody safekeeping specify traditional bank product services. the sec recently decide invite public comment rule implement exemptions. i believe instructive remember context congress adopt change. importantly, replacement general exemption bank more-targeted exemption response problem bank provide trust fiduciary traditional bank product services. in fact, congress recognize bank provide services, i quote, “without problem years.” moreover, congress recognize bank expertise customer relationship make uniquely qualify provide product services. in particular, congress express expectation glb act would disturb traditional bank trust activities. congress conclude trust fiduciary law oversight federal state bank agency provide sufficient consumer protection. the federal reserve board concur judgment congress. we express concern past rule propose sec would significantly disrupt - might force discontinuation - major line business bank well longstanding relationship bank customers. i believe consequence would wholly unwarranted bi review 36/2004 3 give long-standing customer protection provide federal state bank fiduciary laws. the member sec indicate interest engage dialogue bank agency bank industry effect recently propose rules. we carefully review late proposal already express willingness work sec ensure bank exception adopt congress glb act implement manner consistent purpose exception and, thus, enable bank continue engage activity congress intend without incur unnecessary burden expense. conclusion to sure, u.s. system risk-focused bank supervision rely heavily cooperation among multiple state federal supervisors, perfect. but work - and, think, work effectively. certainly, could postpone interstate bank devise perfect system supervise it. the marketplace constantly moving, adjust role. to conclude, i offer one final think financial service convergence. it simply that, even change seen, change inevitable. the future offer promise better, efficient, convenient financial services. your role compliance officer risk manager utmost importance ensure potential achieved. i encourage continue efforts, i confident effort make important difference. 4 bi review 36/2004 seung park: swiftly change economic environment korea speech dr seung park, governor bank korea, asia society, new york, 3 june 2004. * * * introduction mr. president, distinguish member asia society, lady gentlemen, i delight stand today guest asia society. it great privilege opportunity speak many lead member new york’s business community, pleasure see great interest korean economy. let point voice deep gratitude president asia society, nicholas platt, involve invite address today. in almost fifty year since found 1956, asia society play invaluable role build cooperation further flow ideas, people investment country asia unite states. indeed, contribute small degree astonish economic development asia today. member asia society, i salute achievement congratulate wholeheartedly upon success fourteenth asian corporate conference, hold recently seoul. i would like speak today swiftly change economic environment korea confront response it. my focus hollowing-out manufacturing. the hollowing-out korean manufacture the hollowing-out korea’s manufacture sector, many quite aware, proceed fast pace. korean company reluctant make domestic investment manufacturing. in contrast, undertake many new investment project abroad increasingly relocate domestic production line overseas. last year, facility investment korea shrink 1.5% while, strike contrast, korean direct investment china rise 40%. a recent survey find 30% korean small medium-sized enterprises, smes, either actively plan direct investment project abroad preference invest overseas. in case export-oriented firms, figure rise 50%. more one million job create ten thousand korean enterprise set business china. at time, rate unemployment among people twenty korea reach high level 7%. inward direct investment foreign companies, meanwhile, also fall off. flow foreign direct investment korean manufacture sector stand 2.9 billion dollar 2001, figure continue shrink since then, reach 2.3 billion dollar 2002 1.7 billion dollar last year. owe reluctance invest country part home foreign businesses, witness polarization korean industry so-called jobless growth. business involve high-tech sector, exporter large company generally show fast rate growth. on hand, company old technology sector smes dependent domestic demand become le le competitive. what mean that, contraction labor-intensive industries, smes predominate, few new job opportunity open even though gdp may growing. what bring state affair tectonic drift take place locus global manufacture activity. you all, i think, familiar dynamic core global manufacture move 1960s unite state japan, 1980s japan newly industrialize economy include korea. since early 1990s, shift bi review 36/2004 1 china and, part process, korea experience hollowing-out manufacture sector. early hollowing-out u.s. japanese manufacture each shift locus world manufacture production, say process hollowing-out previous manufacture bases, distinct characteristics. even so, common thread run all, root cause lie loss competitiveness due high cost low efficiency. u.s. wage level back 1960s four time high japan’s. in contrast, rate manufacture productivity increase u.s. le one fifth japan. later, wages, house prices, land price continually rise japan early 1980’s, manufacture productivity growth one half korea’s, japan also begin experience fade-out manufacturing. however, i point process hollowing-out underway u.s. japan, scale economy torch pass relatively small. to exact, japanese economy one fifth size u.s. economy 1960s, scale korean economy one fifteenth japan 1980s. the new manufacture center cases, therefore, relatively small capacity absorption. what more, protectionism part predominant economic framework days. various institutional device could, therefore, draw upon protect country’s industries. this mean hollowing-out manufacture u.s. japan take place gradually, leave company government sufficient time respond appropriately. in u.s., notably, industry face decline competitiveness shift production facility offshore instead undergo rational process adjustment involve merger acquisitions, shift specialization closures. to mind, deindustrialization shift focus services, good describe process u.s. refer “hollowing-out manufacturing”. in 1980s japan, similarly, effort aim business rationalization go hand hand simultaneous pursuit product quality enhancement, development cutting-edge technology upgrade industrial structure. in respect, hollowing-out manufacture first pose challenge u.s. japan, eventually serve opportunity country strengthen economic order upgrade industrial structures. difference current hollowing-out korea two previous case the hollowing-out korean manufacture face today part phenomenon tectonic drift world manufacture china. the high cost low efficiency korean economy, drain competitiveness, also play large role. korea’s curse high cost low efficiency date back second half 1980s, per caput national income reach level semi-developed countries. in transition democratic society, long suppress popular aspiration high live standard erupted, time asset price inflation lead formation real estate stock market bubbles. above all, 1990, wage manufacture rise annual average rate 11%, fast pace among oecd members. so one bound, korea become high wage economy. korea’s wage level ten time china nowadays, also rather high compare country like singapore, hong kong taiwan similar korea term stage economic development. what more, korea find situation social cost also high. this come result high real estate price heavy private spend education, also endemic climate confrontation labor management influence vest interest groups. meanwhile, stark contrast, manufacture productivity growth korea one half china since late 1980s. the story end there. the environment hollowing-out korean manufacture proceed different face u.s. japan. firstly, contrast happen u.s. japanese cases, economy base manufacture move korea one already much large scale huge capacity absorption. the chinese economy twice size korea’s. in addition, 2 bi review 36/2004 show high rate growth worldwide, gap term economic scale likely widen. secondly, i point well gap korea china term cost much great saw case involve u.s. japan past. whereas u.s. wage four time japan 1960s, ratio much manufacture base shift japan korea 1980s, difference korean chinese wage level ten one. transportation cost china one half korea corporate tax rate china 15%, much low korea’s 27%. thirdly, contrast previously prevail mood protectionism, predominant current spread around whole world openness. under circumstances, process hollowing-out manufacture set motion, pace spread development get faster. the effect society whole come almost destructive force. for textiles, footwear white electric goods, process hollowing-out already far advance major part production korean firm take place china. even sector hollowing-out still early stages, speed rapidly gather pace. i’m think sector like computers, telecommunications, steel, chemical machinery, midway technological development ladder. a example, two year ago i go china, could hardly see locally produce mobile phone. handset import korea big hit street time. today, however, china already emerge world’s large producer exporter mobile phones. korea’s policy option deal hollowing-out the hollowing-out korean manufacture take place fast across wide spectrum firm government little time spare. it become critical challenge korean economy. will hollowing-out manufacture derail korean economy, take advantage like u.s. japan turn opportunity quantum leap? the answer depend upon korean people react. to embrace challenge exploit opportunity press forward development korean economy, korean people government commit four major endeavors. firstly, must set constantly strengthen economic cooperation south north korean peninsula. this give u short-term relief soften blow represent hollowing-out manufacturing. south korean firm relocate labor-intensive industrial facility kaesung industrial complex, constructed, throughout whole north korea. this breathe new life korean enterprise whose competitiveness wane, smes particular. within kaesung industrial complex, wage level fifty-seven half dollar month, low china. land price reasonable, high level corporate tax rate 14%. so good case korean firm take full advantage point relocate production north korea rather china vietnam. brisk economic cooperation north south also important term prepare national reunification. now many north korea’s industrial facility decrepit state. if expose blast open competition, would option scrap entirely. research institute tell u reunification take place abruptly circumstances, come wall divide peninsula, several million north korean might force flood south seek refuge. this could lead national disaster. in respect, strengthen south-north economic cooperation obviously much desirable option. secondly, need rectify high cost low efficiency characterize korean society. it vital reach social consensus improve climate labor-management relation remove rigidity labor market. on basis consensus, work wage stability. we also start reduce burden social costs. this involve bring house purchase rental cost stabilize house prices. it mean educational reform cut exorbitant level spend private tutoring. it also imply low cost political system allow productive style politics take hold. we also seek bi review 36/2004 3 way reduce loss efficiency cause tendency collective egotism, often find large-scale national investment projects. thirdly, push forward still passionately upgrade industrial structure improve corporate competitiveness. we revitalize manufacture sector new focus advance technology area generate high value-added, it industry. at time, must also promote deindustrialization service-oriented industrialization, give every encouragement financial, logistical, cultural knowledge-based industries. the share manufacture drop economy move mature stage development, service sector rises. in term weight economy, manufacture sector peak u.s. 1953, japan 1970 korea 1988. it show steady decline case. by

susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 3 june 2004. * * * mr. chairman, thank opportunity appear senate committee banking, housing, urban affair discus federal reserve’s participation effort combat money launder terrorist financing. the federal reserve federal financial institution supervisory agency play critical role efforts, federal reserve actively engage number initiative refine strengthen examination protocol area effectively deploy resource prevent, identify, address problem bank organization supervise federal reserve. in remark today, i describe important step take fulfill supervisory mission, guide institution supervise, and, cooperation bank financial service regulator treasury department, make every effort use supervisory tool enhance bank industry’s role prevent detect money launder terrorist financing. the federal reserve’s anti-money launder program multifaceted. it involve work bank supervision, applications, enforcement, investigations, training, coordination law enforcement intelligence communities, rule writing. this morning, i touch aspect federal reserve’s anti-money launder program, concentrate bank supervision effort enforcement matters. i would like begin word federal reserve’s supervisory philosophy area. the federal reserve long share congress’s view financial institution employee frontline effort combat illicit financial activity. the federal reserve belief bank organization supervise must take every reasonable step identify, minimize, manage risk illicit financial activity may pose individual financial institution bank industry. accordingly, federal reserve require financial institution supervise put place appropriate control risk management mechanisms, also devote extensive resource issue guidance legislative regulatory requirement sound bank practices, well coordinate supervisory effort agencies. in addition, federal reserve us enforcement authority, necessary, event serious problem risk cannot satisfactorily address supervisory process. supervisory strategy procedure anti-money launder counter terrorist finance it longstanding policy federal reserve supervisor incorporate bank secrecy act compliance anti-money launder program component every safety soundness examination conduct reserve bank. this mean regular examination cycle, examiner seek determine bank organization’s bank secrecy act (bsa) anti-money launder (aml) compliance program satisfactory commensurate organization’s business activity risk profiles. examination conduct state member banks, bank hold companies, edge act corporations, u.s. branch agency foreign bank supervise federal reserve. every reserve bank bsa/aml specialist coordinator staff, and, since late 1980s, board anti-money launder program supervision division oversee senior official. simply put, bank secrecy act anti-money launder compliance year integral part bank supervision process federal reserve. furthermore, federal reserve’s enforcement program strong history address anti-money launder safety soundness problem formal actions, necessary. while number action may fluctuate somewhat year year, federal reserve’s exercise enforcement authority consistently strong timely. the federal reserve supervision process include on-site examination off-site surveillance monitoring. the federal reserve generally conduct on-site examination bank supervise every twelve eighteen months, examination staff review institution’s anti-money launder procedure compliance bank secrecy act, bi review 35/2004 1 amend usa patriot act new treasury regulations. for large, complex bank organizations, safety soundness examination process continuous, anti-money launder bsa compliance incorporate examination conduct throughout year. the federal reserve always include bsa/aml examination supervisory strategy every bank organization supervise. a key component anti-money launder examination institution’s compliance bsa compliance program requirement. the federal reserve federal bank agency compliance program requirement institution supervise. in general, rule require bank establish, maintain, document program includes: • system internal control ensure ongoing compliance bsa, • independent test bank’s compliance bsa, • train appropriate bank personnel, • designation individual responsible coordinate monitor day-to-day compliance bsa. the federal reserve work ensure bank organization supervise understand importance place effective anti-money launder program. when reserve bank conduct bsa/anti-money launder examination bank organization supervision, four component program establish framework examination. to properly evaluate effectiveness bank organization’s anti-money launder program, federal reserve develop comprehensive examination procedure manuals, regularly provide train examiners. the bsa/aml examination procedure currently revision reflect newly issue regulation usa patriot act. the federal reserve’s bsa examination risk-focused. while “core” bsa examination require bank organizations, risk-focused procedure allow examiner apply appropriate level scrutiny higher-risk business lines, necessary, alleviate burden high-risk product customer present. in words, small state member bank low-risk customer base receive considerably different le burdensome bsa/aml examination large, complex bank organization international operations. the examination process during every safety soundness examination bank organization federal reserve supervision, bank examiner specially train bsa requirement review institution’s previous current compliance bsa. examiner first determine whether institution include bsa/aml procedure operational areas, include retail operations, credit, private banking, trust, adequate internal control procedure detect, deter report money launder activities, well potential financial crimes. a part examination, bank examiner also review institution’s fraud detection prevention capabilities, policy procedure cooperate law enforcement (whether respond subpoenas, act information request section 314 usa patriot act, otherwise). our supervision policy guidance area require examiner also conduct review database suspicious activity report (sars) currency transaction report (ctrs) determine bank organization examine file report appear complete timely. examiner count number sars ctrs, compare find institutions, base criticism solely numerical count, rather make sure, example, bank u.s. branch foreign bank understand obligation critical area take step fulfill responsibility file timely accurate report law enforcement bank regulators. the on-site examination begin review institution’s write compliance program documentation self-testing training, well review institution’s system capture report certain transaction pursuant bank secrecy act, include suspicious unusual transaction possibly associate money launder financial crimes. transaction test generally conduct verify systems. 2 bi review 35/2004 in instance deficiency bsa/aml program, include failure adequately document self-testing training, obvious breakdown operate systems, failure implement adequate internal controls, federal reserve’s examination procedure require examiner conduct intensify second-stage examination would include review source document expand transaction testing, among steps. there important correlation area cover bsa/aml examination institution’s overall risk management internal controls. thus, bank examiner take account organization’s enterprise-wide corporate governance mechanism applied. the federal reserve’s bank examiner able apply broad perspective depth organizational knowledge area bsa/aml coordinate examination analytic staff ensure safety soundness bsa/aml examination integrate comprehensive. the federal reserve find important synergy gain integrate safety soundness bsa/aml supervisory processes. enforcement action the federal reserve focus significant resource prevention early resolution deficiency within supervisory framework. when problem identify bank organization, typically communicate management director write report. the management director request address identify problem voluntarily take measure ensure problem correct recur. most problem resolve promptly bring attention bank organization’s management directors. in instances, however, examiner identify problem relate anti-money launder measure pervasive, repeated, unresolved management, otherwise serious concern use federal reserve’s enforcement authority warranted. if problem require formal action, reserve bank authority take informal, non-public supervisory action, require adoption appropriate resolution institution’s board director execution memorandum understand institution reserve bank. when informal action suffice, federal reserve authority take formal, public enforcement action compel management director bank organization address anti-money launder bsa compliance problems. these action include write agreements, cease desist orders, civil money penalties, legally enforceable court. these action delegate reserve banks, undertake concurrence board’s general counsel board’s director division bank supervision regulation. because action public, significant impact bank organization, particularly one public company. in determine whether formal action appropriate, federal reserve staff consider relevant factors, include nature, severity, duration problem, anticipate resource action necessary resolve problem, responsiveness director management. in case examiner identify violation compliance program requirement, federal bank agency bind law take formal enforcement action. the law require bank agency promulgate rule require four-part compliance program i discuss early provide institution fail establish maintain require procedures, fail correct previously identify problem procedures, agency must issue formal action require institution correct problem. the federal reserve take responsibility seriously issue number public action bank organization fulfillment statutory mandate. federal reserve staff exert every effort ensure statute implement consistently, board staff act central coordinator examination enforcement staff different reserve banks. over past three years, example, federal reserve take approximately twenty-five formal, public enforcement action address bsa/aml-related matters. action take large bank organization well small one - one constant examination process identify regulatory violation organizations’ compliance program that, law, mandate supervisory actions. in addition take action itself, federal reserve may refer bsa-related matter treasury’s financial crime enforcement network (fincen) consideration enforcement action base solely bsa violations, rather program failure issue relate safety soundness. treasury delegate federal financial bank agency authority examine bsa bi review 35/2004 3 compliance institution normally examine safety soundness; however, treasury delegate authority take enforcement action, assessment fine, violation bank secrecy act. federal reserve staff coordinate enforcement action regulator agencies, include area anti-money laundering. if bank organization’s problem involve entity supervise different regulators, resolution enterprise-wide problem may involve multiple enforcement actions. for example, office comptroller currency (occ), fincen, federal reserve coordinate recent enforcement action riggs national corporation; riggs bank, n.a.; riggs international bank corporation, bank’s edge act subsidiary, ensure consistency concurrent resolution open issues. the federal reserve coordinate enforcement action state bank supervisor regular basis, enforcement action involve operation foreign bank organization may resolve cooperation supervisor abroad. in several recent matters, close coordination u.s. department justice well. the application process before i describe aspect federal reserve’s supervisory process, let touch important component federal reserve’s anti-money launder process - process application notice file board. the federal reserve longstanding practice consider applicant’s compliance anti-money launder law evaluate various applications, include bank merger acquisition insure depository bank hold company well application file foreign bank establish u.s. bank office foreign bank supervisory enhancement act. the usa patriot act include provision memorialize practice application area require board take account effectiveness applicant’s bsa compliance program consider application various laws. under longstanding protocol well new law, every application matter consider federal reserve include bsa/aml compliance-related component whereby staff make specific judgment regard applicant’s compliance law important area. while i cannot, course, comment specific cases, i report board staff recent occasion advise bank organization consider expansion activity require file application federal reserve concentrate instead bsa/aml programs. while full equivalent enforcement action, i sure appreciate fact every bank organization seek plan seek federal reserve approval application make every effort possible ensure anti-money launder program consider fully satisfactory examiner deficiency may identify address expeditiously possible. the application process give board strong tool bsa/aml area. guidance bank organization turn back federal reserve’s normal supervision process, board reserve bank supervisor seek provide guidance bank organization assist fully understand applicable regulatory requirement expect regulators. while financial institution are, course, fully responsible compliance, supervisor play important role ensure regulatory requirement correctly understand uniformly applied. this particularly true area compliance new regulation promulgate since usa patriot act. the federal reserve view supervisory role include initiative enhance awareness understand examiner throughout federal reserve system, bank organization federal reserve supervision, financial industry large. to promote full understand anti-money launder requirements, federal reserve issue supervision regulation letters, use advise reserve bank supervisory staff, supervise institutions, bank industry policy matters; provide on-going train examiners; speak regularly financial industry; issue guidance conjunction regulator treasury. these initiative mean respond anticipate question arise regard anti-money launder requirements. the federal reserve keenly aware resource anti-money launder counter-terrorist finance requirement demand financial institution belief duty assist meet obligations. 4 bi review 35/2004 federal reserve resource commitment the federal reserve’s bsa/aml function range supervise regularly examine bank organization subject federal reserve supervision compliance bsa relevant regulations, require corrective action detect weakness bsa/aml programs, enhance money launder investigation provide expertise u.s. law enforcement community, provide train u.s. law enforcement authority various foreign central bank government agencies. over past three years, example, federal reserve expert bsa/aml-related matter participate special review fund transfer federal law enforcement intelligence authorities, teach class fbi department homeland security train academies, hold seminar central bank foreign supervisory authority ten countries, include botswana, mexico, russia unite arab emirates, engage discussion aml-related matter international forum basel cross-border group financial action task force money launder (fatf). over course past ten plus years, federal reserve’s anti-money launder program grow dramatically. from senior official outset assign coordinate federal reserve’s bsa activity late 1980s, creation staff early 2004 new section within board’s division bank supervision regulation dedicate solely anti-money launder effort (the anti-money launder policy compliance section), federal reserve continue commit grow number resource bsa/aml compliance. in 1993, federal reserve system begin practice designate senior examiner twelve reserve bank serve bank secrecy act coordinator bsa examiner reserve bank. the number senior bsa examiner throughout system grow tremendously, particularly since enactment usa patriot act increase complexity bsa examinations. the web bsa examiner throughout federal reserve system bring together direct communication channel board’s aml policy compliance section. this communication important tool gather examination experience provide consistent guidance throughout federal reserve system. by standard, federal reserve take leadership role u.s. government’s international bank regulatory community’s anti-money launder efforts. supervisory coordination due complexity financial institution today, imperative federal reserve coordinate long list agency issue tie bank secrecy act. first, federal reserve view department treasury fincen important partner due leadership role administer bank secrecy act. in addition, number complex financial institutions, federal reserve share supervisory regulatory responsibility occ, federal deposit insurance corporation, office thrift supervision federal level, bank agency various states, foreign bank authority international operation u.s. bank operation foreign bank unite states. this network partner require high degree coordination. the regulatory authority communicate constantly regard bsa-related matters. for example, among bank regulators, number electronic system place allow secure access examination information. this allow regulator monitor status organization direct indirect purview. it also federal reserve’s practice notify relevant functional regulator supervisory action may impact institution subject supervision. in addition, bank regulator collaborate development consistent examination procedure examiner training. the usa patriot act require surge rulemaking activity, federal reserve regulatory colleague continue advise treasury complete important work. law enforcement coordination the federal reserve routinely coordinate federal state law enforcement agency regard potential criminal matters, include anti-money launder financial crime activities. this coordination may occur federal reserve take action address matter also address criminal proceeding, financial condition bank affect criminal matter, law enforcement draw federal reserve staff expertise investigative work. bi review 35/2004 5 the federal reserve maintain open channel communication law enforcement, whether interagency work group informal staff level contacts. conclusion the federal reserve belief bank organization take reasonable prudent step combat illicit financial activity money launder terrorist financing, minimize vulnerability risk associate activity. for reason, federal reserve’s commitment ensure compliance bank secrecy act continue high supervisory priority. the federal reserve important role ensure criminal activity pose systemic threat, and, important, improve ability individual bank organization unite state abroad protect illicit activities. thank invite today explain federal reserve’s work important area. 6 bi review 35/2004 lars nyberg: economic activity house finance sweden speech mr lars nyberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, conference, frankfurt main, 4 june 2004. * * * i would like begin thank invitation come frankfurt introduce “eurocatalyst investment focus: nordic cover bonds”. i shall start word riksbank’s activities. with objective maintain price stability, riksbank conduct clear monetary policy inflation target 2 per cent one two year ahead, tolerance deviation plus/minus 1 percentage point. in addition, riksbank task promote safe efficient payment system. a part work carry two tasks, riksbank publish inflation report four time year financial stability report twice year. the recent inflation report publish last week, late financial stability report publish day yesterday. for interest economic financial development sweden, i would recommend read reports. economic activity everything i mention economic activity assessment inflation take directly riksbank’s late inflation report (2004:02), present friday, 28 may. in report forecast gdp growth oecd area average around 3 per cent come three years. with regard outlook sweden, riksbank foresee average annual growth rate almost 3 per cent come years. look inflation prospects, rate price increase expect rise period ahead resource utilisation increase sweden abroad. however, continuation relatively weak labour market condition favourable cost situation mean rise inflation expect relatively moderate sweden. our forecast report risk-adjusted inflation rate 1.1 per cent one year ahead 1.8 per cent two year ahead, measure und1x inflation. swedish house finance on 1 july year act issue secure bond (2003:1223) come force. one main incentive behind new act offer swedish mortgage institution favourable finance opportunity institution face european country already introduce similar legislation. so new legislation result new finance structure swedish mortgage institution large issue volume international markets? this remain seen. the riksbank has, reason principle, hesitant towards introduction legislation secure bonds, primarily supervisory task charge finansinspektionen (the swedish financial supervisory authority) could perceive imply government guarantee, also legislation field entail return regulation credit market, questioned. however, similar legislation introduce several european countries, mortgage bond regulate accord legislation secure bond come various way view creditworthy mortgage bond not. it therefore claim swedish mortgage institution give opportunity issue secure bond mortgage institution countries, also view hold riksbank. swedish mortgage institution today already observe strict legislation view kind special company securitisation. the potential effect introduce particular legislation secure bond therefore possibly le sweden countries, difficult see legislation regard secure bond would entail dramatic change activity swedish mortgage institutions. however, advantage involve introduce legislation. have legislation line european country contribute reduce uncertainty, particularly foreign investors, regard term connect own security issue swedish mortgage institutions. this reasonably result broad circle investor will invest security issue swedish mortgage institutions, hopefully also bi review 35/2004 1 reduce borrow costs. in addition, european central bank currently regard type mortgage bond creditworthy mortgage bond cover legislation secure bonds, market participant pledge collateral them. even basel ii regulations, come force 2007, provide scope regard mortgage bond cover legislation secure bond creditworthy mortgage bond cover legislation. however, swedish market mortgage bond already large, liquid market function well since deregulation end 1980s. it third-largest mortgage bond market europe, german danish markets. after swedish government, swedish mortgage institution large issuer money bond market sweden. a much around 40 per cent lend non-bank public mediate via mortgage institutions, largely finance activity issue bond certificate security markets. the market dominate five mortgage institutions, together account around 99 per cent borrowing. the four large mortgage institution subsidiary four large swedish banks, fifth, sbab, state-owned. the mortgage institutions’ annual report show much around 30 per cent security borrow carry abroad, suggest already considerable interest among foreign player legislation secure bond proposed. however, considerable difference institutions. some institution explicit policy raise half borrow requirement abroad name, others manage borrow abroad via parent bank, issue security bank group’s name ensure low possible borrow costs. neither unusual bank mortgage institution buy bond issue mortgage institution compete bank groups. the reason bank allow use bond issue institution collateral borrow riksbank, allow pledge bond issue institution outside bank group. a result, mortgage bond largely own banks, contribute reduce liquidity mortgage market. there several factor affect ability company borrow market. these include, course, possibility easily ass borrowers’ credit rat quality assets. this make easy borrower extensive contact network institutional investor familiar borrower activities. build maintain type contact network credibility require time considerable resources. the swedish mortgage institution long establish contact networks, primarily swedish security market, liquidity swedish mortgage bond greatest. a rough measure liquidity, ratio bond sell stock outstanding bonds, show bond sell around 4 time one year swedish mortgage bond market. this compare market swedish government bonds, correspond turnover rate around 7. the difference insignificant, indicate do create liquid secondary market swedish mortgage bonds. the new legislation create condition improve term mortgage institution house finance. however, responsibility make use condition lie bank mortgage institution themselves. a decisive factor whether bank mortgage institution succeed utilise new condition offer secure bond listen investors’ wishes. first foremost, require establish liquid secondary market secure bonds. this require willingness issue large volume bond primary market. maturity construction must also tailor investors’ requirements. the institution always work way domestic market. the composition mortgage institutions’ loan portfolios, state institutions’ borrowers, course decisive factor price security issue mortgage institutions. the mortgage institutions’ lending, break different type property, show lending, around 94 per cent, go finance ownership single-family dwell apartment buildings. it therefore primarily development household sector house market important assess mortgage institutions’ assets. the riksbank’s financial stability report contain analysis household sector property market. the recent report observe swedish household continue increase debt burden rapid rate. improve disposable incomes, low interest rate high turnover house market important reason behind this. households’ debt relation disposable income increase around 90 per cent mid-1990s almost 120 per cent 2 bi review 35/2004 today. however, interest payment tax loan comprise around 5 per cent disposable incomes, compare level almost 11 per cent begin 1990s. both debt ratio interest ratio expect continue increase come years. nevertheless, swedish households’ ability service debt relatively good. in addition disposable incomes, household also asset use buff increase borrow costs. their total asset exceed total debts. a special article study household debt households’ ability service debt different income classes. in article riksbank examine household would affect increase interest cost rise unemployment. the result show significant part debt account household substantial asset fairly sizable margins; even sharp increase interest rate unemployment would affect ability service debt extent would seriously increase risk lend swedish households. the risk lend household sector therefore remain small, even individual household studied. here add household sector cause problem bank financial crisis early 1990s; despite fact interest ratio rise 11 per cent 1991 unemployment peak 1993 8.5 per cent. with regard development house prices, assessment still swedish house valuation relatively reasonable. fundamental rise disposable income fall interest cost could large extent explain observe price trend. the demand house expect grow rapidly supply. however, development house price sweden vary considerably region region. price metropolitan region rise significantly large amount country whole, although price stockholm region stagnate past two years. there also steep price rise tenant-owned apartment single-family dwellings. it difficult, present, envisage tendency towards imbalance could lead substantial fall prices. some form unforeseen event, change regulation macroeconomic shocks, would probably necessary cause price fall sharply. the fact interest rate rise long term include household expectation hardly regard unforeseen event economic scenario. the market apartment build also characterise rise price since 1994. regulation utility value, system central rent negotiations, normally lead stable, even development price apartment buildings. however, conversion rental property tenant-owner association result recent year relatively sharp price rise apartment buildings. price development can, course, affect change condition substantial increase new construction rapid decline demand. however, low level house construction high demand housing, particularly metropolitan regions, indicate case. conclusion the riksbank’s work monetary policy financial stability emphasis importance transparency, clarity predictability. these also important factor security market mortgage institution active. i hope mortgage institutions’ actions, couple new legislation, help render market house finance efficient. bi review 35/2004 3 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, mr lucas papademos, vice president european central bank, frankfurt, 3 june 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today’s meet govern council ecb. however, i first like inform decision take regard publication staff macroeconomic projections. a aware, twice year eurosystem staff, is, staff ecb euro area national central banks, jointly produce set macroeconomic projections. these serve one input deliberation govern council. subsequently, projection publish june december issue monthly bulletin. a also know, interim period, is, march september, ecb staff produce basically update eurosystem staff projections. these projection also serve input meet govern council, far published. the positive experience familiarity gain past year publication macroeconomic projection give u confidence go step also publish interim ecb staff projections. therefore, spirit transparency accountability, ecb staff projection also publish september 2004 onwards. in cases, is, four time year, projection publish appropriate form monthly bulletin. in addition, step towards provide relevant information timely manner, today onwards provide advance copy monthly bulletin section cover projections. this advance copy make available shortly end press conference, hard copy ecb’s website. the procedure apply september every three month thereafter. the fact decide publish interim ecb staff projection future change role one input deliberations. the govern council continue base monetary policy decision comprehensive economic analysis, cross-check monetary analysis. let turn today’s monetary policy discussion. in summary, note economic recovery strengthen recent months. at time, also witness strong inflationary pressure short term. nevertheless, still view medium-term outlook remain line price stability. accordingly, leave key ecb interest rate unchanged. the low level interest rate continue support economic recovery. we remain vigilant regard development could affect risk price stability medium term. i shall explain assessment detail. in context economic analysis, late data release confirm economic recovery euro area way. accord eurostat, real gdp grow 0.6% quarter quarter first quarter year, quarterly real gdp growth fourth quarter last year revise upwards 0.3% 0.4%. the pronounce pace real gdp growth mainly reflect strong private consumption buoyant exports. late survey data still provide mix signal regard underlie strength recovery remain fully consistent ongoing growth current quarter. look ahead, condition continuation recovery remain place. economic growth outside euro area continue strong promote export growth. on domestic side, investment benefit positive global environment well favourable finance conditions. improvement corporate efficiency high profit also support business investment. moreover, private consumption gradually recover stagnation witness 2003, broadly line growth real disposable income which, usual lag, underpin increase employment growth late on. bi review 35/2004 1 accordingly, expect ongoing recovery euro area economic growth come quarters, lead broad strong upswing course next year. this also reflect eurosystem staff projections, envisage euro area real gdp growth 1.4% 2.0% average 2004, rise 1.7% 2.7% 2005. available forecast international private organisation convey broadly similar picture. with regard scenario, risk uncertainty directions. on one hand, current rather robust pace economic growth outside euro area, recent development private consumption well survey data imply potential strong growth dynamics, particularly short term. on hand, high oil price could pose downside risk. over long horizon, concern also remain persistence global imbalances. concern prices, recent oil price development create considerable upward pressure consumer prices. accord eurostat’s flash estimate, annual hicp inflation 2.5% may, partly due base effects, stand 2.0% april. market expect oil price decline gradually recent peaks. if remain recent high levels, expect inflation rate would continue high previously anticipate stay 2% long month ahead. when assess price trend medium term, however, outlook remain favourable. in particular, overall import price development remain moderate inflationary pressure wage unit labour cost contained. both factor help bring annual rate consumer price inflation back 2% 2005. these view line eurosystem staff projections, put average annual hicp inflation 1.9% 2.3% 2004 1.1% 2.3% 2005. they also broadly consistent recently release forecast international private organisations. these forecast projection subject number risk uncertainties. concern relate particular oil price developments. moreover, insufficient knowledge today future change indirect tax administer prices; information item typically become available towards end year. against background, potential risk second-round effect via wage need monitor closely. finally, increase measure long-term inflation expectation derive financial market indicators. while indicator interpret caution, recent upward trend call particular vigilance. move monetary analysis, see increase evidence normalisation portfolio behaviour private investors. a consequence, annual m3 growth fall quite significantly recent quarters. still, low level interest rate continue fuel monetary growth amount excess liquidity remain high euro area. in economic upswing, persistence excess liquidity could lead inflationary pressure medium term. to sum up, economic analysis indicate main scenario outlook price development medium term remain line price stability. however, short-term pressure inflation increase recently upside risk need take account. cross-check monetary analysis also support case vigilance regard materialisation risk price stability. give sign economic recovery continue, particularly important fiscal policy structural reform play part improve economic fundamental euro area. it regretful recent fiscal development helpful respect. a grow number country report significant imbalance fiscal consolidation effort fall disappointingly short commitments. in order strengthen confidence sustainable upswing, essential clarity future course consolidation fiscal policy re-established country concerned. this require credible measure emphasis structural expenditure reform imbalance redressed, tax/benefit system become growth-friendly social security system put sound financial footing. these measures, together revive momentum towards effectively implement structural reform labour product markets, would provide valuable support current economic upswing. we

everyone welcome. welcome also join u videoconference. today’s gather important, i’m glad take time attend. before i begin i want say hello member management forum executive management committee u today. these town hall become bite springtime tradition. the snow melt time come u get together. we take stock are, we’re going, want get there. a know, many institutions, governmental private, currently concern governance structures, accountability rule behaviour. of course focus issue couple year ago establish compass. and it’s compass i’d like focus now. it amaze document. i think capture essence are. and one truly great thing come be. create compass comprehensive exercise. it top down, bottom side side. staff opportunity take part consultation, debate, careful consideration go make it. together, produce remarkable set commitment canadians, excellence, other. we really don’t need worry produce something new. but useful get together, remind created. our commitment canadian place legislate mandate concrete terms. canadian need confidence value money earn quality bank note carry around. they need confidence canada’s financial system. they want know bank manage government’s fund integrity. and communicate accountable do. when say commit canadians, we’re say we’re commit foster confidence integrity central bank. our second commitment excellence. it reflect high standard set work behalf canadians. it go hand hand statement make launch compass medium term plan. namely: commit performance second none among central bank world. it challenge goal then, still is. but we’re get there. we’re outstanding work monetary policy; i’m proud way continue meet inflation control targets. in area currency we’re produce new bank note canadian journey series. the new $100 bill represent first three new note issue year; note design secure, durable well-accepted. here bank foster ongoing atmosphere trust, respect innovation strong system values. we continue place strong emphasis research analysis aspect work. how else commitment excellence evidence? there partnership cultivate within outside bank. we communicate clearly openly. we nurture leadership levels. and cultivate diversity, people ideas. together, ways, achieve excellence. the third commitment make other. we clear want work environment found strong set values. the first articulate idea listen others. we agree share knowledge experience could learn other. bi review 35/2004 1 then, pledge develop talent career achieve personal excellence. your development, course, always rest first foremost you. but bank provide impetus, help create environment conducive learn grow environment two official language use interchangeably. “knowledge sharing” vital organization. i hope together progress make bank true knowledge-sharing institution complete medium-term plan. and bank encourage excel develop yourself, also recognition fact life outside bank. we commit work environment employee respected. when respect individuals, kind debate need help u become best be. we clash idea secure knowledge winner losers. or rather, we’re winners, we’re explore aspect issue. and finally, say would recognize demonstrate commitments. i encourage continue think way recognize people area live values. we need celebrate successes. we need share ideas. that direction lay out. three strongly state commitments, number simply state value intend help u meet them. i impress compass written, i’ve impress well live it. you show real leadership make strong statement stand for. the compass serf u well. but know, today’s emphasis corporate governance accountability, organizations, private public, search way achieve already achieved. many organization set put place set highly detail rule constrain behaviour. but i sure lot highly detail rule answer us. i don’t think need much compass. i think, large extent, part u now. and i think proof integrity - integrity - clearly one tower strength institution. so i don’t think need lot new rule govern behaviour. and need explicit guideline procedures, i’d like u tread rather lightly. but i want say couple word today two particular areas: disclosure wrongdoing conflict interest. first, let deal disclosure wrongdoing. we policy time now, executive management committee think important also procedure conform generally procedure government canada proposing. i encourage examine procedure closely; questions, please talk manager. the second point i want make regard conflict interest policy. the sign-off important. not anything wrong go on, policy help ensure don’t run kind conflicts. so have, organisation, thing place beyond compass. but compass i always find come back to. practically everything need there. and it’s respectful document. it give u responsibility exercise good judgment. and importantly, say trust so. i’m really proud institution operate way. and fact something i believe take pride in. because, let’s face it, it’s something happen itself. it’s coincidence. it idea shape compass. and it’s coincidence compass even relevant today put together. so, congratulation create it, live it. 2 bi review 35/2004 donald l kohn: the outlook inflation remark mr donald l kohn, member board governor u federal reserve system, national economist club luncheon meeting, washington dc, 4 june 2004. * * * inflation pick year, enough raise question mind whether might rise trend pose risk price stability. total consumer price inflation measure chain price index personal consumption expenditure (pce) rise 1.4 percent twelve month last year annual rate 3.0 percent first four month 2004. of course, portion acceleration due fast increase energy price year. but strengthen price increase confine energy markets. pce price exclude food energy rise annual rate 1.7 percent year, 0.8 percent last year. the consumer price index show similar pattern acceleration. the recent shift inflation see price index also attitudes, anecdotes, expectations. business report price many input production process increasing, also sense return “pricing power” allow pas least cost increase customers; impression late great number story general-circulation newspaper focus rise price effect households; expectation economist household near-term inflation move higher. the commitment federal reserve maintain price stability remain strong unaltered. price stability responsibility, record past thirty-five year demonstrate important meet it. allow business household plan operate without worry increase general price level long run contribute best foster economic efficiency rise standard living. a number member federal open market committee (fomc), included, quite explicit note current level federal fund rate consistent, time, objective preserve price stability. the question path tighten likely necessary accomplish objective, answer question depend critically behavior inflation. although inflation ultimately monetary phenomenon, stance policy - measure either interest rate liquidity provision - connect direct simple way rate inflation. individual price determine supply demand market good services, average price relationship aggregate supply demand. monetary policy act inflation indirectly alter balance among multiplicity factor affect supply demand. to make well-informed policy decisions, need analyze element behind recent increase inflation form judgment likely future course. like many economists, i believe inflation process influence number factors, chief among are: degree productive capacity economy utilized; one-time shift product price result shock important supply demand curves; change productivity growth; inflation expectations. this basic model rough approximation complex constantly evolve mechanism price determination, track record hardly consider flawless.1 but offer useful framework analysis inflation, i go use purpose here. i want emphasize i speak today. the analysis view own, necessarily colleague fomc.2 1 in simulation frb/us model, us framework, 70 percent confidence interval around four-quarter forecast core pce inflation 1-1/4 percentage point wide. 2 david wilcox, john roberts, jeremy rudd, peter tulip federal reserve board’s staff provide valuable assistance. bi review 34/2004 1 the data before begin examine determinant inflation, need remind inherently noisy nature price data. they highly variable month-to-month quarter-to-quarter, imperfect proxy true change general prices. a consequence, discern underlie trend inflation easy task. have i speak year ago, would expect address possibility deflation federal reserve might either head deal interest rate reach zero. in newspaper market reports, would read integration china india global trade system mean persistent excess supply labor product would place downward pressure wage price develop world year come. now concern shift whether inflation rising, early story frequently turn heads. it increasingly common hear strong demand energy basic materials, importantly include demand asia, boost inflation here. to sure, underlie economic situation change past year - particularly, growth pick unite state elsewhere around world. but actual circumstance probably shift dramatically commentary, serf warn important try gauge fundamental force bear inflation reduce chance mislead noisy data. in regard, although weak economy, associate slack resource utilization, rapid increase productivity undoubtedly reduce inflation last year, core inflation - especially measure core cpi - seem fall more, low level, 2003 fundamental explain. typically, departure historically normal behavior persist, inflation tend return level line fundamental determinants. indeed, step-up inflation year last year’s pace may partly reflect return. within cpi, component call owners’ equivalent rent, account nearly quarter overall index, seem important factor surprise decline inflation last year. that series us movement home rent proxy change cost home ownership. owners’ equivalent rent rise 2 percent 2003, 3-1/4 percent 2002. some deceleration rent expect low interest rate hold user cost own home, favor home ownership renting. however, owners’ equivalent rent soften one would predict historical relationship rent interest rates. so far year, owners’ equivalent rent rise annual rate 3 percent, return typical relationship interest rate contribute pickup core inflation. of course, even rebound core consumer price inflation represent simply reversal factor keep inflation unusually low last year, influence might work would cause inflation continue rise. to get sense whether cusp worsen inflation, must examine might affect supply demand good services. determinant inflation economic slack. judgment source recent increase inflation likely course price next year rest part assessment close economy produce long-run potential. history indicate capital labor fully employed, competition market share job tend push rate inflation.3 use measure potential output economic slack real-time forecast policymaking present daunt challenges. that potential output something ever observe directly verified; infer behavior variables, include price themselves, observe. estimate potential output slack also complicate change time labor product market alter degree resource utilization consistent stable inflation. 3 we need careful overstate importance slack determine future course inflation, however. in econometric models, measure slack account one-fourth le year-ahead fluctuation core consumer price inflation. 2 bi review 34/2004 that said, indicator suggest economy continue operate appreciable - albeit diminish - margin slack. for past six months, unemployment rate average little le 5-3/4 percent. this rate peak 6-1/4 percent middle last year, still somewhat level that, basis experience last decade so, appear consistent stable inflation. capacity utilization manufacture recover little 75 percent recent months. but level remain well long-run average 80 percent. a number observer argue lately pickup pace technological change rapid evolution character global competition increase speed capital equipment become obsolete workers’ skill become poorly match job requirements. if effect important, current consensus estimate natural rate unemployment well “natural rate capacity utilization” could overstate degree effective slack. i skeptical argument couple reasons. in labor market, behavior compensation recent year consistent standard model wage dynamic incorporate natural rate still somewhat current unemployment rate. moreover, one surprise development current cycle extent decline labor-force participation. many analyst adopt work hypothesis decline reflect type “discouraged worker” effect, albeit one capture standard statistical series attempt measure phenomenon. presumably, many people exit workforce face poor employment prospect stand ready resume compete job market improves. if correct, current level unemployment rate relative estimate natural rate, may, anything, understate availability labor resources. in addition, i believe relationship federal reserve’s measure capacity utilization available slack manufacture sector change materially late. this measure is, part, benchmarked utilization rate large survey individual plant manager would aware of, take account, technological obsolescence equipment factories. these survey data, well data capacity various trade sources, fully reflect permanent plant close within, most, year so.4 most measure resource utilization change much year ago, inflation falling. the unemployment rate hover near 5-3/4 percent much 2002 first quarter 2003; capacity utilization recover fraction low level since deep recession early 1980s. the structure function market pace obsolescence simply change enough year alter materially implication give read particular indicators. the net decline core measure inflation past year - even take account possible understatement inflation last year - consistent noticeable gap resource utilization still exist today. go forward, i anticipate continue strong growth demand but, give persistent solid gain productivity potential output, gradual close output gap. under circumstances, ongoing competitive pressure labor product market help contain cost price increases. the downward pressure probably diminish time, least while, economic slack continue operate restrain force overall trend inflation. of course, i may wrong assessment slack economy. a central bankers, need cognizant uncertainty associate estimate potential output adjust policy event prove u wrong. but now, i believe balance evidence point conclusion recent rise inflation probably signal economy produce beyond 4 in view observers, argument federal reserve’s capacity measure overstate available slack lend credibility recently much high capacity utilization number publish institute supply management (ism). the difference ism federal reserve’s estimate operate rate likely lie definition capacity. the federal reserve’s measure assume availability additional labor, needed. the ism measure capacity plant produce current labor force. in wake significant cyclical contraction manufacture employment, experience recent years, definition capacity rely worker place indicate much le slack definition include current labor limit factor. since labor add relatively quickly, federal reserve’s definition capacity utilization seem relevant assess effective slack manufacture sector. bi review 34/2004 3 sustainable potential, rather cause work. i turn causes. price shocks. quite price push high recent quarter special influence supply demand specific product involved. such increase probably contribute broad pickup inflation see year, likely go source continue upward pressure prices. it surprise substantial strengthen aggregate demand abroad boost price input production process, noticeable effect product short-run supply relatively price-inelastic. increase commodity price typical expansion gather momentum, unusually large current episode synchronous strengthen overseas, especially asia. petroleum price particular pressure, reflect strong demand also risk supply could constrain terrorism political disruption. the decline foreign exchange value dollar past year contribute rise price import unite states. the price core non-energy import begin increase rapidly general level core consumer price 2003, difference widen first quarter year, add general price increases. in addition, dollar’s decline reduce intensity foreign competition felt u.s. producers, may one source sense among domestic producer price power returned. commodity import small part consume, change price well price energy usually affect measure core consumer inflation much. but recent situation notable size number price shock go direction, even limit pass-though individual price movements, total effect probably significant. judge result statistical model incorporate factor examining, increase commodity, energy import price together might boost core consumer inflation order roughly 1/4 1/2 percentage point past four quarters. but already see evidence limit nature type price-level adjustments. the price many non-energy commodity come peak lately, perhaps reflect actual expect moderation growth asia ongoing demand supply response high prices. in addition, dollar stabilize optimism increase strength durability expansion unite states. energy price continue climb, future market see moderation price get way long. if circumstance prevail, shock commodity, energy, import price long add much inflation. of course, long haul, whether one-off shift price level lead ongoing price inflation determine effect inflation expectation response monetary policy, issue i refer shortly. productivity. the rate increase productivity also important effect inflation pressures. in past years, example, juxtaposition rapid productivity growth weak aggregate demand result slack resource utilization i talk earlier, contribute decrease inflation. but productivity growth also influence inflation effect labor compensation profit margins. over long run, real labor compensation tend track labor productivity. this imply productivity accelerates, compensation eventually well. the record post-world war ii period suggests, however, change compensation tend lag well behind change productivity trends. thus, underlie productivity growth pick up, firm tend enjoy wide profit margin time unit labor cost tend initially decelerate. the economy enjoy fruit rapid productivity growth form unusually high level production without add inflation form low inflation. we realize last half 1990s productivity growth pick up. over time, compensation catch productivity, profit margin tend come back toward normal levels, output must return long-run potential inflation avoided. productivity increase especially rapidly recent downturn initial stage subsequent expansion. we know time degree confidence whether increase mark pickup structural productivity growth - is, already rapid rate increase late 1990s. we reasonably certain portion 4 bi review 34/2004 extraordinary increase productivity past year response particular circumstance prevailing. these include pressure profit finance firm economy sluggish availability efficiency gain business continue find good way utilize large amount new technology capital become available 1990s. the extraordinary increase productivity recent year reduce unit labor cost elevate profit margin near record levels, even inflation continue decline. i think anticipate productivity growth remain strong sustain basis, even unlikely match outsized gain past years. meanwhile, compensation growth strengthen labor market tighten business bid hard labor take advantage profit opportunities. nonetheless, high level business profit margin suggest that, even unit labor cost begin rise quickly prices, effect inflation could mute time firm would room absorb cost increase form reduce profit margins. such experience late 1990s. the initial surge productivity show mostly high profit margin 1996 1997. from 1998 2000, compensation catch productivity, unit labor cost rise rapidly price without place inflation significant upward pressure. to sure, margin cannot shrink forever - cannot grow sky. but elevate margin provide cushion cost pressure pass price - long central bank allow excess demand develop product markets. inflation expectations. inflation expectation play key role price determination. among effects, rise inflation expectation tend become self-fulfilling people seek protect process set wage prices. expectation price increase near-term - specifically, next year - have, fact, rise noticeably heel actual increase inflation. but, i discussed, price shock give rise increase inflation past month look though unlikely repeat may already process partially reversing, expectation subside actual inflation. moreover, available survey suggest recent uptick total core inflation materially affect expectation inflation long term. this stability long-term inflation expectation evident survey professional forecasters, conduct federal reserve bank philadelphia, median expectation household respond university michigan survey. however, pattern inflation compensation treasury security market le reassuring. a widen spread ten-year nominal ten-year index security surprising; part widen account increase short-term inflation expectations. but part could read also signal investor concern inflation distant horizon. the spread forward rate embed nominal yield curve five ten year forward rate derive index yield curve widen 50 basis point since late march. change spread mislead indicator inflation expectations. it affect idiosyncratic movement either nominal index yields, reflect change liquidity market compensation inflation risk well inflation itself. but could warn sign. long-term inflation expectation firmly anchor price stability make task keep inflation low much easier. the federal reserve make plain commitment preserve price stability, i confident would act decisively counter deterioration longer-run inflation expectation threaten objective. summary policy implication the evidence analysis i review suggest recent pickup price increase probably represent lead edge steadily worsen inflation. much acceleration early month year likely reflect rebound unexplainably low inflation last year feed-through increase commodity, energy, import prices. the best indication economic slack persist long-term inflation expectation stable, bolster inference economy enter situation steadily rise inflation. most economic forecast point gradual approach toward full utilization productive capacity economy. commodity, energy, import price unlikely continue move speed recent quarters. productivity growth still strong. and elevate profit margin available absorb bi review 34/2004 5 increase unit labor cost while. a result, inflation likely remain level consistent continuation effective price stability. that said, federal fund rate cannot hold current level indefinitely price stability preserved. the accommodative stance policy - include low level fund rate fomc’s indication intend hold level - put place counter unusually weak demand decline inflation. circumstance change policy respond. the challenge face remove accommodation way foster return full employment maintenance price stability. because i believe rise inflation limit i agree growth output likely moderately exceed growth economy’s potential, i support fomc’s assessment last meet accommodation likely remove pace likely measured. but experience counsel caution. there much inflation process understand, i surprise extent pickup core inflation year. moreover, measure inflation expectation require careful scrutiny move forward. an examination variable believe proxy aggregate demand potential supply help explain inflation forecast future price developments, concept integral make monetary policy. but give limit understand price determination, must also keep close watch actual inflation outcomes. it take twenty year undo effect economic behavior inflationary episode 1970s. we must preserve gain meet responsibility foster economic growth stability. 6 bi review 34/2004 birgir ísleifur gunnarsson: interaction monetary financial stability small open economy welcome address mr birgir ísleifur gunnarsson, chairman board governor central bank iceland, suerf seminar, reykjavík, 3 june 2004. * * * lady gentleman on behalf central bank iceland, i warmly welcome seminar interaction monetary financial stability small open economies. it honour u co-sponsor seminar suerf. we grateful david llewellyn, eduard hochreiter, beatrix krone micheal bailey suerf excellent cooperation enjoy preparation. the topic seminar appropriate one attract increase attention, within outside central banks. i trust presentation discussion next two day leave u good understand interaction issue wish focus attention period ahead. we assist impressive speaker participants. i wish extend gratitude agree give lecture present paper i look forward inspire stimulate contribution them. in address, i briefly describe recent experience area monetary financial stability. the current act central bank iceland adopt 2001. it assign central bank main objective pursue price stability. the bank grant instrument independence pursue main objective, financial independence enhance act include clear provision transparency accountability. the act also state bank promote efficient safe financial system, include payment system domestically foreign countries. in addition price stability, bank was, words, give clear mandate concern financial stability. an inflation target framework adopt practically time joint declaration government central bank set target inflation 2½% twelve-month rise cpi. the framework impose strong demand professional capacity central bank. the bank regularly publish macroeconomic forecast inflation forecast, associate inflation report. the inflation forecast provide foundation inflation target policy. in quarterly monetary bulletin, bank publish detail analysis current economic monetary development prospects. it also present rationale behind decision board governor change change interest rates, well signal monetary policy intention period ahead. in endeavours, bank seek transparent possible. when inflation target adopted, economy quite unbalanced. it boom second half 1990s. the upturn originally well balance lead foreign direct investment exports. but eventually turn overheat surge private consumption, fuelled, among things, rapid credit expansion increasingly liberalise financial environment. in due course, imbalance begin negative effect expectations, partly sharply deteriorate current account. the currency begin slide fell third trade-weighted term period year half late 2001. this development affect inflation rise import price feed domestic prices. when inflation target framework adopted, recent measure twelve month rise cpi 4%. the króna continue depreciate time adoption target inflation rise significantly upper tolerance limit inflation target. the central bank pursue restrictive monetary policy, repeatedly raise policy interest rate reach historically high level. this ultimately lead rapid fall inflation january 2002 late year fall inflation target, remain le since recent measure. bi review 34/2004 1 we pursue inflation target policy three years. our view successful. inflation bring control relatively quickly adoption inflation target unbalance economic circumstances. there also firm evidence inflation target regime earn credibility market community. the monetary regime test period ahead, among thing characterise exceptional level foreign direct investment aluminium industry associate publicly own debt finance power plants. our experience strong indication inflation target policy pursue small open economy large economy deep financial markets. this policy resource-demanding impose necessity strong discipline respective central bank. in view increase focus financial stability central bank act 2001 natural well within accept framework central bank activities. the bank responsible bank supervision end 1998 function merge insurance supervisory authority new unify financial supervisory authority, central bank cooperate quite closely financial stability issues. while central bank responsibility bank supervision, attention necessarily focus individual institution oversee operation comply exist law regulations. before bank supervision transfer elsewhere, central bank also begin focus attention broad financial stability issue along line many central bank time. a logical part process 2000 bank begin publish semi-annual financial stability analysis quarterly monetary bulletin. one reason increase focus bank systemic financial stability issue late 1990’s grow perception liberalise financial market weak financial system could undermine economic monetary stability much economic imbalance weak policy could undermine otherwise sound financial system. a sound financial system, include safe secure payment settlement systems, also important precondition effective implementation monetary policy. capital movement fully liberalise 1990’s, domestic financial market also undergo significant structural change, include withdrawal government direct ownership bank institutions. these development stiffen competition home link domestic financial system much closely international markets. consequently, analyses, central bank consistently draw attention potential vulnerability domestic financial system change external environment, include ready availability foreign credit refinance purposes, vulnerability sudden change exchange rate. the development icelandic economy towards end last decade one resemble many way experience nordic country decade earlier. needle say, view experience nordic countries, development cause considerable concern underlie stability financial system. the central bank candidly express concern financial stability reports, notably spring 2001. at time imf also issue financial stability assessment question strength financial system iceland view tremendous imbalance economy perceive underlie weakness bank institutions. the imf identify potential risk rapid depreciation currency, felt could weaken bank pose threat them. early upswing, amidst rapid expansion lend external indebtedness banks, particularly short-term foreign debt, central bank impose liquidity requirement commercial banks. it purpose stem growth foreign borrow shift weight foreign indebtedness short end maturity spectrum. another prudential rule set central bank concern foreign exchange exposure commercial banks. this sharply limit scope take direct foreign exchange risk. beyond prudential regulations, mean central bank affect practice bank public pressure, example semi-annual financial stability report public private statements. the bank use method vary degree success. in line traditional role central banks, central bank iceland serve lender last resort domestic bank experience liquidity shortfall. the central bank also systematically build foreign exchange reserve order strengthen external liquidity position economy. 2 bi review 34/2004 a happened, icelandic economy land remarkably softly turbulent period 1998 2001. i mention early inflation bring inflation target late 2002. the external current account le balance 2002 two year deficit measure 10% gdp, credit growth come halt, stark contrast happen nordic country decade earlier, bank emerge period satisfactory position gain considerable strength since. no doubt many reason relatively favourable outcome. one could mention generally good external condition adjustment period, relatively sound fiscal policy, swift correction external imbalance, well rapid turnaround exchange rate reach trough decline rate inflation inflation target. in follow-up report 2001, imf recognize mid 2003 successful adjustment icelandic economy, significantly increase strength financial system important change regulatory framework. the principal objective monetary policy central bank iceland price stability, i mention earlier. it principal goal financial stability. the financial stability analysis focus macroeconomic stability factor strength soundness financial system whole. the bank address principal area strong professional ambition. it two main field analysis reinforce benefit close cooperation among staff. both area force u put analyses, projection policy longer-term perspective provide opportunity good overall economic monetary policy management. although much remain explain nature interaction monetary financial stability, i mention early sound financial system precondition economic monetary stability implementation effective monetary policy. in respect, area support other. since financial liberalisation introduced, face circumstance financial stability concern directly affect conflict monetary policy decisions. our aim prevent situation arising. the potential risk financial stability end last upswing defuse swift achievement monetary stability restoration internal external balance. in conclusion, i would like repeat warm welcome participant seminar. i trust seminar stay iceland interest rewarding, professionally socially. bi review 34/2004 3 jaime caruana: risk management trend supervisory structure remark mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, 31st general assembly geneva association, madrid, 27-29 may 2004. * * * i. introduction overview i would like thank mr de castries, mr liedtke, member geneva association invite participate 31st general assembly. a chairman basel committee bank supervision, i honour address another organisation name distinguish city switzerland. it special privilege madrid, far bank spain. our organisation may hail different swiss city different sector financial service industry, yet organisation monitor trend risk management work encourage advance discipline. this difficult enormously important duty us. financial organisation - whether insurance companies, security firms, bank - compete knowledge customers. they seek tailor product service customer’s ever change needs. to succeed environment product service must evolve quickly, financial service provider must understand thoroughly benefits, cost risk current activities, watch horizon carefully future change might alter balance risk rewards. supervisors, part, must ensure regulatory system encourage banks, security firms, insurance company capable manage risk today ready respond new challenge tomorrow. risk management supervisory system cannot evolve independently other. on contrary, supervisory agency financial service provider currently work tandem develop “virtuous circle” risk management supervision. together, want ensure supervision reflect best practice develop industry, encourage institution improve practice constantly. this morning, i would like share financial supervisor’s perspective “virtuous circle” emerge encompass risk management supervision. i’ll begin remark result study outline great advance achieve lead financial institution around world develop rigorous comprehensive risk management approaches. at time commercial organisation make improvement internal processes, supervisor seek incorporate improvement supervisory structure, second topic. we move toward flexible forward-looking approach financial supervision seek motivate prudent management - thereby complete “virtuous circle” - encourage advance risk management. the reform underway especially evident bank world basel committee’s “basel ii” framework. i add international association insurance supervisor (iais), fellow association supervisor insurance area, discuss supervisory framework would apply insurance regulatory system globally. evolution risk management reform financial supervision complement reinforce other, progress area influence work underway globally revise account guidelines. the geneva association take great interest topic, i conclude remark brief think perspective convergence account standards, advance risk management, supervision. ii. trend across financial service sector allow begin overview recent trend risk management. last year, body represent major financial supervisory agency conduct study 31 banks, security firms, insurance company 12 jurisdictions. this body - call “joint forum” - consist expert supervisor member agency basel committee, international organisation bi review 34/2004 1 security commissioner (iosco), iais. the joint forum seek identify best practice develop guidance activity across financial service sector. in report, publish august 2003, joint forum identify two important recent trend among large, complex firm engage banking, securities, insurance, mix activities. a. integration risk management function. one notable advance risk management across three financial service sector grow emphasis develop firm-wide assessment risk. this constitute first trend joint forum’s report. improvement technology telecommunication make easy firm gather, collect, analyse large amount data exposure business activity efficiently increasingly near “real time.” to make best use firm-wide data, organisation establish dedicate risk management function foster highly integrate systematic approach risk measurement management. the risk management function typically promote use common risk measure across business lines. it report firm-wide risk data senior management. report may range daily update “value-at-risk” trade position regular, le frequent, compilation result stress testing. the broad use share definition guide comprehensive report risk across firm enable integrate risk management function identify concentration risk. concentration matter particularly various business line within firm different kind exposure counterparty. comprehensive consistent report helps, moreover, ensure firm aware wide range risk exposed; understand relative importance various risk may interact; firm le likely ignore material source risk. the joint forum’s study suggest single model organise integrate risk management function become dominant. in financial organisations, function may exercise considerable degree control individual businesses. in others - especially insurance company - local business unit continue operate autonomously great degree. yet nearly firm establish integrate risk management unit highly dependent quality information technology collect, analyse, report firm-wide data efficiently effectively. some participant find great challenge develop centralise risk management structure lie construct compatible efficient management information system across businesses. a result, devote substantial resource term personnel expenditure maintenance enhancement management information systems. b. risk aggregation single measure. collect risk data across many business line catalyse effort aggregate measure risk quantify rigorous fashion. this second major risk management trend identify joint forum report. the quantification risk certainly new concept insurance industry. actuary long seek estimate likelihood various event take place. in recent years, however, see financial risk manager researcher apply mathematics, statistics, model many risk exposure previously think readily quantifiable. in bank industry, example, statistical computational analysis develop evaluate exposure market risk led, past decade so, application similar technique credit risk. indeed, introduction increasingly reliable estimate driver credit risk, probability default, lead many proposal form basis basel ii bank capital framework, i discus minutes. the joint forum find “ultimate expression” risk aggregation summation many type risk single risk measure. this measure, often call “economic capital,” estimate amount capital firm require protect risk certain degree confidence. but benefit develop aggregate measure risk across diverse business line especially appeal complex financial organisation whose activity span many kind activities. 2 bi review 34/2004 a result, surprise large, mix financial conglomerate tend invest development economic capital estimates. iii. the structure financial supervision the two trend financial service sector integrate risk management dedicate function aggregate risk measure single measure economic capital form first part “virtuous circle.” these trend influence much behaviour individual firms. they similarly influence structure financial supervision. this lead second topic morning, namely supervisor complete “virtuous circle” adopt regulation foster continue improvement measurement management risk. in insurance sector, movement visible european union’s “solvency ii” project. the iais’s initiative establish new international insurance regulatory framework likewise significant industry new future. but certainly lot attention pay work basel committee supervisor undertake reform international bank capital adequacy framework basel ii. basel ii represent one important reform bank supervision. for past years, central bankers, bank supervisors, industry discuss way revise 1988 basel accord, constitute cornerstone bank regulatory framework. the 1988 accord landmark achievement right. it represent first internationally accept “yardstick” determine adequacy bank’s capital. it relatively simple apply and, perhaps result simplicity, adopt supervisor 100 countries. but simplicity may lead way gradual decrease relevance sophisticate bank systems. lead bank make substantial improvement measure risk. a joint forum reported, industry leader introduce integrate risk management function raise standard quantify aggregate various risks. extraordinary growth practice securitisation use sophisticate derivative product allow bank transfer credit risk way 1988 accord capture. in addition, bank begin manage exposure operational risk separately comprehensive practice comparable management credit market risk. by late 1990s, become increasingly clear lead bank supervisor original accord long provide meaningful measure risk sophisticate bank organisations. a result, basel committee others begin discus way revise exist capital rule account advances. supervisor seek simple revision exist framework. we want align capital requirement closely best measure economic risk bank actually face. we seek furthermore fortify stability bank sector bank could continue serve source credit good year bad. in view, promote financial stability benefit banks, also business consumer well. to incorporate late advance risk management, develop forward-looking approach supervision, committee embrace “three-pillar” approach capital requirements. rather simply set static minimum requirement capital levels, new capital framework rely three mutually reinforce policy approaches. they consist of, first, risk-sensitive minimum requirements; second, consistent system supervisory review; and, third, enhance transparency market discipline. each three pillar offer unique benefit own, real strength three pillar stem ability complement other. the first pillar - specify minimum capital requirement - constitute direct approach supervision. by apply uniform set rule banks, first pillar add transparency regulatory process. apply share set rule bank make easy compare organisation get sense relative degree solvency. on technical level, committee base measure risk advance practice bank adopting. the rule reflect evolution credit risk management allow qualify bank rely partly estimate driver credit risk determine amount capital require particular exposures. one driver credit risk might bank’s estimate borrower’s probability default. similarly, new capital rule reflect advance operational risk measurement incorporate explicit capital charge exposure loss. bi review 34/2004 3 so minimum rule align capital charge closely good measure actual underlie economic risk industry developing. this clear example harness advance make lead institution within industry. furthermore, encourage institution lead edge field make enhancement internal control risk management processes, new accord offer explicit economic incentive adopt - time - accurate measure risk sophisticate mean control exposure risks. however, basel committee recognise rely uniform rule alone would introduce certain drawbacks. rule tend inflexible therefore might preclude ignore innovation. apply uniform rule may also fail account bank’s unusual business risk profiles. consequently, second pillar, supervisory review, address drawbacks. it introduce judgement policy mix. bank supervisor exercise discretion determine capital need relevant particular business risk profiles. that degree discretion make supervisory framework flexible good able adapt change innovation. finally, third pillar, market discipline, add great transparency process. when bank disclose information offer meaningful insight risk position exposures, marketplace participant good able ass financial health. counterparties, investors, rat agencies, even customer reward bank manage risk properly penalise hold unrealistically low amount capital risk. their reaction provide economic incentive bank strengthen management risk hold least adequate level capital risks. one might say basel ii seek “efficient frontier” policy objective three pillars. each pillar provide something two cannot. each essential achieve overall objective financial stability. i realise analogy three pillar portfolio policy option oversimplification. but help u visualise think “efficient frontier” involve mixture minimum rules, temper supervisory discretion, supplement market-based incentives. iv. consistency account standard three-pillar system of course, three-pillar supervisory system highly dependent firm’s internal measure risk exposures. “basel ii,” example, look bank’s measure risk pillar 1. supervisor engage bank manager dialogue interpretation measure - step manager take response - pillar 2. finally, pillar 3 intend give market great insight measure risk exposure bank may control them. because three pillar dependent internal measures, neither supervisor banker ignore mechanic define financial data record reported. those mechanics, know, govern national account standards, last topic i would like address. supervisor global market participant face significant hurdle exercise discipline entity whose operation span one jurisdiction. business practice differ countries. legal system may unfamiliar. decipher balance sheet prepare national account system extremely tax undertaking. consider burden alone, easy agree supervisory market discipline would effective harmonious - completely harmonise - account rules. but task formidable. in duty safeguard reinforce financial stability, central bank financial supervisor legitimate interest quality account standard effective implementation. we believe order help fortify financial system, account standard support - least consistent - sound risk management control practice use industry. in addition, account standard facilitate market discipline provide transparent “window” organisation’s financial position performance likewise measure management risk exposures. finally, account standard facilitate effective supervision financial institutions. in specific case insurance industry, i think it’s fair say almost u believe that, international standard complete, need single, high quality standard develop address insurance liabilities. the challenge lie specify model fit together seamlessly 4 bi review 34/2004 international account guideline time align well sound insurance risk management supervisory objectives. give issue we’ve face area accounting, seem unlikely quick easy job. that challenge align account guideline sound risk management objective well supervisory objective exist across financial service sectors. it explain financial supervisors, especially basel committee, attach great importance play active role international debate accounting. in basel committee’s case, seek represent supervisory perspective key account issue relevant banking, support work underway account profession towards convergence account standard globally. with regard basel ii, committee work closely colleague international account standard board avoid conflict pillar 3 broad account standards. in fact, committee view pillar 3 refinement account standard apply banks’ specific exposures. because recognise much area, continue monitor account market development light pillar 3. our dialogue account standards-setting body account profession continue grow year come. v. conclusion this morning, i share view need risk management supervision evolve together reinforce other. all u recognise area must keep pace change account practices, i think would agree work undertake three area - risk management, supervision, account - quite demanding. to develop new way think risk technique measure it, require hard research significant resources. we must gather pour large amount data sharpen understand various risk relationship other. we must dedicate talent, staff, indeed fund undertake work. i would argue equally demand develop supervisory structure capitalise encourage advances, especially try implement share framework across many jurisdictions. but benefit many. on microeconomic level, virtuous circle i describe help individual firm improve quality control short run strengthen competitiveness long run. yet supervisor especially motivate benefit expect macro level. we believe that, financial institution right incentive pursue profit responsibly, financial service sector become good managed, resilient, good able serve source sustainable growth economy. attain promise great financial stability challenge worthy talent, time, hard work. with that, i would like thank welcome conference. i offer best wish fruitful thought-provoking discussions. bi review 34/2004 5 philipp m hildebrand: switzerland - challenge remain lead financial centre speech dr philipp m hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, financial management association (fma), european conference zurich, university zurich, zurich, 3 june 2004. * * * i please even reflect switzerland: challenge remain lead financial center. moreover, i honor share platform peter wuffli, walter kielholz bruno gehrig. the financial management association commended; assemble three outstanding leader representative swiss financial industry. i much look forward comments. when i think swiss financial industry, two closely link think come mind: first, switzerland’s status one world’s lead financial center second, important contribution financial sector overall vigor resilience swiss economy. go forward, key challenge swiss financial industry maintain lead global status world fierce competition. because financial sector’s critical contribution overall economic well-being swiss people, meet challenge important financial sector swiss citizen concern long-term vitality economy. many familiar relevant figures: roughly 10 percent switzerland’s real gdp derive financial sector. if one add insurance sector, number close 14 percent. that percentage increase significantly since 1990 total 10% gdp le 7% bank sector only. importantly, take account many economic activity directly link many case dependent vibrant financial sector. in term employment, financial insurance sector together employ approximately 185’000 people 6% total swiss employment. the total federal local tax contribution swiss bank sector amount estimate chf 13 billion 13% total tax revenues. a mere perfunctory consideration figure suffice underline importance defend maintain switzerland’s status lead global financial center. in 1974 study, charles kindleberger trace history financial center western countries. what strike professor kindleberger’s historical find nothing ever take granted. not unlike tides, city country international financial center rise fall. for part, rise fall seem reflect dynamic criterion transportation infrastructure, political stability regulatory patterns.1 since 1970s, competition amongst international financial center course become genuinely global diverse place luxembourg, singapore, hong kong, dubai and, recently, shanghai join race. switzerland good reason confident ability defend status. most importantly, set position strength. particularly area wealth management comprise half total add value banks, switzerland clearly one world’s lead provider services. the value total asset manage customer account domestic bank end year 2003 amount chf 3’300 billion, nearly 60% hold foreigners. accord various estimates, correspond approximately one third world’s total private wealth manage abroad. much say write various strength swiss financial center account dominant global position wealth management. political, economic monetary stability, know-how, traditional high quality service provided, guarantee protection privacy strict condition ensure prevention abuse key ingredient switzerland’s past future success. in current global market place, strength represent structural competitive advantages. the swiss authority swiss financial sector representative rightly 1 charles p kindleberger (1974): “the formation financial centers: study comparative economic history”, princeton study international finance, no 36, princeton: princeton university, november. bi review 34/2004 1 make great effort defend structural competitive advantage much sovereign country defend theirs. nonetheless, fierce global competitive environment, defense necessary sufficient condition sustain success. the offensive component comprehensive swiss strategy must unequivocal commitment politicians, regulator financial sector representative competition free markets. such commitment foster innovation ensure long-term viability switzerland lead global financial center. a commitment competition include firm commitment effective regulatory system base transparency, proportionality, predictability uncompromising fight abuse. such regulatory framework stand opposition commitment free markets. to contrary, strengthen free market uphold integrity markets. regulatory authority must loose sight primary aim regulation: uphold integrity market impede function markets. let conclude brief formal comment specific example innovation face global competitive pressure foster viability swiss financial center. in recent years, hedge fund become important segment global asset management industry. recent figure indicate total asset invest hedge fund approach usd 1’000 billion mark. in comparison, total size open-end mutual fund industry unite state usd 7’500 billion. accord industry figures, annual growth rate hedge fund industry appear accelerate level excess 15% recent years. these figure suggest investor increasingly look largely unconstrained investment activity focus absolute return. in addition, important shift traditional high net worth client invest individual hedge fund fund invest hedge fund via diversify pool formal fund fund structures. these pool assets, couple liberalize regulatory development open hedge fund diverse universe investors, include wide range institutional retail investors. currently, total size fund invest hedge fund via pool structure estimate approximately usd 300 billion nearly third underlie hedge fund industry. remarkably, annual growth rate estimate pool fund suggest expansion proceed rapid pace underlie hedge fund industry. this imply significant portion new asset flow hedge fund via collective asset management pools. in competitive environment, swiss financial sector succeed leverage position one world’s lead asset manager secure dominant position amongst collective asset management pool operator hedge fund industry. though many early formal fund fund register luxembourg, cayman island bermuda law, swiss financial firm today manage significant part world’s alternative asset management pools. with grow importance industry recent years, swiss regulator ease regulatory restriction facilitate investment control asset pool swiss financial institution also legal registration formal fund fund vehicle swiss law. moreover, swiss financial firm become leader financial engineer structure underlie hedge fund asset pool accord differ client demands. the example manage asset pool hedge fund industry illustrate swiss financial firm competitive capable respond market demands, particularly area asset management. in future, swiss financial firm rise new challenge secure position switzerland lead global financial center. one opportunity might provide wide range trust-related service global wealth management clients. regulator important difficult role play. their primary responsibility safeguard integrity switzerland financial center, thus bolster global standing. at time, must become obstacle innovation impede competitive swiss financial firm respond rapidly evolve market development vibrant global financial industry. 2 bi review 34/2004 hermann remsperger: real-time data monetary policy welcome address professor hermann remsperger, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, bundesbank conference “real-time data monetary policy”, eltville, 28 may 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, i pleasure welcome conference “real-time data monetary policy” organise heinz herrmann, athanasios orphanides pierre siklos. our conference concentrate uncertainty actual level key macro variables. until year ago, issue receive little attention academic debate monetary policy. this change dramatically last years, least influence economist attend conference like athanasios orphanides dean croushore. awareness measurement problem real-time data important consequences. one could separate two class i would like term “ex post” aspect one side “ex ante” aspect other. with “ex post” aspects, i mean implication empirical analysis monetary policy. for instance, learn evaluation forecast base final data may mislead take account data actually available time forecast made. or, another example, analyse monetary policy decisions, important reconstruct information set available policy maker time decision made. with “ex ante” aspects, i mean implication measurement problem conduct monetary policy. this category include question like “how learn past data revision improve knowledge future data?” “how awareness measurement problem influence policy decision choice monetary policy approach?”. obviously, topic interlinked. answer question require real-time data set key variable like real nominal gdp, potential output inflation. at first glance, develop real-time data set seem rather simple - enter old data spreadsheet save future use. but practice, old data usually overwrite new data without save old vintage. produce real-time data set thus require substantial amount effort, include dig old source data figure data available time - herculean task, consider lack documentation much data. in us, research real-time issue owe much effort dean croushore tom stark federal reserve bank philadelphia develop comprehensive real-time data set u economy. at time, athanasios orphanides reconstruct real-time data forecast available fomc greenbooks prepare federal reserve staff meeting. the pioneer work american collegues show measurement problem indeed matter conduct monetary policy. for example, learn study problem measurement error likely particularly severe output gap - concept figure prominently much recent literature monetary policy issues. thus, surprise researcher outside us, particular europe, take issue real-time data. this conference eltville offer good chance present recent research issue. today tomorrow, listen presentation paper base real-time national data us, uk, germany, japan, canada, norway switzerland well realtime oecd forecast g7 country euro area countries. we bundesbank start compile set real-time data german economy two half year ago. and use data select research topics. let give three examples. bi review 33/2004 1 first, jörg döpke use data set calculate real-time output gap (discussion paper 11/2004). in accordance study orphanides van norden (1999, 2002), find real-time gap differ considerably counterpart base late vintage data. one period difference today’s estimate real-time perception output gap particularly pronounce economic boom follow german reunification. at time, measurement error output gap reach size four percentage point (depending estimation method used). in particular case, error due temporary underestimation actual output well persistent overestimation potential output. doepke’s result thus provide additional evidence measurement problem seriously distort assessment current economic activity relative long-run trend. second, thomas knetsch analyse importance inventory investment german business cycles. he find preliminary national account data inventory investment generally poor quality. in another paper, discus additional real-time information, particular data ifo business survey, use improve upon preliminary official figure current level inventory (discussion paper nine 10/2004). third, christina gerberding, franz seitz andreas worm use real-time data set re-examine exist “evidence” bundesbank’s monetary policy well capture standard taylor rule. a know, clarida, gali gertler claim show bundesbank pursue strategy monetary target effect follow forward-looking variant taylor rule. i wish anticipate discussion conference. but i’m sure hear new argument monetary policy germany past. for instance, gerberding, seitz worm present evidence bundesbank respond deviation real-time measure money growth, expect inflation output growth respective targets. in view, debate bundesbank’s monetary policy directly lead “ex ante” aspect data uncertainty, thus follow question: how central banker deal measurement problem form data uncertainty decision-making process? i’d like make four short remark question. first all, seem fairly uncontroversial concern data uncertainty provide additional important argument fine-tune economy monetary policy instruments. we take account data current output expose considerable uncertainty. on top that, even difficult estimate potential output. hence, every attempt fine-tune economy bear risk policy error correspond negative effect price stability. in view, that’s second point, recent research data uncertainty support principle cautious monetary policy approach (“steady go policy”). a know important data economic situation subject revision, generally make sense wait newer, reliable, data. cautious central banker change status quo monetary policy sign assume change development key macroeconomic variable become apparent. the problem data uncertainty suggest rely one single indicator ass risk price stability. instead analyse broad range information variables. however, follow broad approach, take account extent measurement problem differ one indicator other. very generally speaking, that’s third point, i’d like emphasise indicator monetary financial sphere far le affect problem data uncertainty real economic variable output output gap. against background, come surprise monetary policy approach robust possible different form data model uncertainties. in past years, number simulation study carry ass monetary policy approach achieve good result various assumption transmission process. these study take account model uncertainty. however, largely disregard problem data uncertainty. consequently, value practical monetary policy rather limited. 2 bi review 33/2004 i think, search robust strategy monetary policy could broaden include kind measurement problem discus conference. take broad perspective, that’s fourth final point, monetary policy would consider robust perform well face different form data model uncertainty. research direction begun.1 i hope research give support ecb’s strategy. let conclude emphasise research real-time data utmost importance central banks. that’s i much interest paper present today tomorrow. i wish thought-provoking discussion pleasant stay conference facilities. thank much attention. 1 see, instance, walsh, c (2003): “implications change economic structure strategy monetary policy”, federal reserve bank kansa city”. bi review 33/2004 3 john hurley: the role central bank current issue consider financial service regulator open statement mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, joint committee finance public service, dublin, 1 june 2004. * * * introduction thank chairman opportunity address committee afternoon. my colleague i happy discus committee general issue arise overcharge aib certain foreign exchange customers. i appreciate noted, invitation us, examination specific issue relate aib bank ongoing. other serious issue emerge since time invitation. a know, work matter responsibility irish financial service regulatory authority rather bank. in open remark i would like deal following: • the role central bank financial regulation follow restructure take place last year; • the central bank’s role relation financial stability; • the profile bank system ireland; • the former responsibility central bank relation foreign exchange charges; • the current issue consider financial service regulator; • the compliance environment. role central bank i would like start briefly put role central bank context describe new regulatory structure place follow establishment new financial service regulator restructure last year. on first may 2003 central bank financial service authority ireland established. this body carry activity formerly carry central bank ireland well several additional regulatory functions, include previously discharge regulatory bodies. the regulatory department central bank, i.e., staff records, transfer regulatory authority. accordingly cbfsai two distinct component entities: 1. the central bank in addition corporate entity responsibility central services, central bank also extensive functions, include euro-area relate functions. our main function are: a) monetary policy operations; b) financial stability; c) economic analysis; d) currency payment systems; e) investment foreign domestic assets. 2. the irish financial service regulatory authority a know, body responsible regulation authorise financial entity include banking, security insurance consumer protection consumer information matters. bi review 33/2004 1 the financial service regulator clearly define responsibility decision-making power own. it responsible regulation financial service firm ireland. it also greatly enhance function come consumer protection consumer education. these regulatory power function exercise independently central bank. there wide range additional enforcement power assign financial service regulator central bank financial service authority ireland bill, 2003. these additional powers, i know, much welcome financial service regulator i believe appropriate timely. there new focus financial regulation includes, particular, emphasis consumer. there also grow recognition internationally desirability financial institution supervise single regulator case ireland. the financial service regulator focus protection consumer help make inform decision safe fair market foster sound dynamic financial institutions. the central bank’s statutory responsibility regard relate stability overall financial system individual institutions. we common interest stability solvency financial sector protection interest consumers. in discharge function aim promote vibrant financial service industry continue prosper competitive international environment. financial stability some concern express current arrangement put place that, somehow, financial service regulator might fully independent central bank. i assure committee case. the central bank’s role relate stability overall financial system. this year, publish stand-alone financial stability report outline extensive work undertake bank financial stability. financial stability work include development various early warn indicator systemic risks. these event could spread one institution another give rise serious problem financial system economy generally. the work also include procedure require event systemic emergency. the reason strong focus financial stability financial crisis costly, alone financial also economic terms. many country experience crisis seriously impact economic growth - cases, 10% gnp. on international comparison, ireland’s financial stability record good. it worth note discharge financial stability role public interest central bank also protect consumer financial services. in conclude comment financial stability, i stress event currently investigation carry serious reputational risks, give rise adverse implication financial stability. profile bank system one unfortunate fallout problem arise tarnish image irish bank system, excellent reputation internationally. this regrettable, sound successful bank system compare well international peers. the bank also one large employer workforce nearly 40,000. the bank sector account 4-5% gnp major contributor government revenue. pension type save hold significant shareholding bank performance bank important them. the bank industry vital country. i pas without brief reference ifsc. a know, one great success stories. the centre solid record success even global downturn early 90’s. there nearly 12,000 people directly employ ifsc make significant contribution economy. in large industry like financial services, problem improper practice inevitably arise time time; true countries. the important point procedure process place deal timely expeditious manner, financial service regulator doing. despite serious problem arisen, i believe mark improvement corporate governance standard industry recent years. any recommendation emanate 2 bi review 33/2004 current investigation suggest improvement necessary implement without delay. i emphasise regulatory system - matter extensive expensive guarantee mistakes, inappropriate practice behaviour never happen. however, essential event occur - despite comprehensive regulatory system place - regulatory machinery capable deal effectively speedily. i believe measure put place since mid-nineties together forthcoming enactment new power presently report stage dáil, provide system. foreign exchange charge there statutory control bank charge prior enactment central bank act, 1989. section 28 1989 act place statutory requirement bank notify central bank every proposal change charge associate term condition. the central bank power direct bank refrain change charge, term condition. this power frequently exercised. in addition legislative requirements, central bank also require bank advertise change charge national press come effect. i mention statutory underpin control bank charges, irish system much stringent countries. in 1994, government formally announce intention transfer responsibility bank charge central bank director consumer affairs. from time, central bank decide would consider application increase charges; wish pre-empt, way, future role decision director. some exception make this, introduction new service “laser”, agreement director consumer affairs. when legislation come effect director consider proposal independently advised, legislation, institution charge apply them. responsibility approve bank charge vest financial service regulator since 1 may 2003. a i indicate already, issue overcharge aib subject independent investigation report financial service regulator aib. recent development when liam o’reilly team recent day give information background investigation foreign exchange charge issue within aib. an independent investigation - i understand fund aib - foreign exchange charge establish direct involvement financial service regulator. it carry external firm forensic accountant oversee independent assuror, mr lauri mcdonnell. i understand full report issue issued. the financial service regulator also engage another investigation, relate matter concern aib investment manager ltd (aibim) period 1989 1996. all issue raise investigation consider regulator comprehensively detail. it decide action need take regard. i fully share concern already express liam o’reilly regard recent revelations, improper practice within financial service industry ireland totally unacceptable. i fully support approach take issue financial service regulator. the compliance environment i wish offer word compliance environment. it important recognise fundamental change way client fund handle investment firms, aibim, since passage investment intermediary act 1995 stock exchange act, 1995. since time code conduct client money rule issue investment manager require invest substantially compliance functions. the system control transparent would bi review 33/2004 3 1989-1996 period i think le likely anything like happen could happen would unlikely go undetected. with regard tax matter generally, go similar cultural change. since public account committee dirt investigation since development, late 1990s, money launder regime - include tax evasion - apply banks. bank require heavily invest compliance. money launder special focus financial service regulator’s inspection programme detail guidance place bank regard. i feel similarity way tax issue treat way treat early 1990s, either bank or, i think, among public generally. the approach taxation matter much rigorous. in relation remain issues, best wait hear outcome financial service regulator’s investigation. only regulator position give full report issue relate aib. many matter concern root early period compliance environment much weak present. i think danger generalize basis events, many occur several year ago, danger miss improvement take place significant change regulatory compliance framework within bank operate. problem improper behaviour inevitably occur. but generally speaking, attitude compliance among irish bank improve recent year and, i doubt follow events, standard strengthened. conclusion to summarise position, chairman, i regard event speak today serious deeply disappointing. these matter fully investigate financial service regulator. the financial service regulator go task comprehensive, detail pro-active manner. i full confidence reach appropriate conclusion take necessary remedial action. thank you, chairman, permit make open statement. my colleague i happy answer question committee may wish put us. 4 bi review 33/2004 jaime caruana: basel ii - new approach bank supervision remark mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, fourth annual international seminar policy challenge financial sector: “basel ii - international bank system crossroads”, washington dc, 1 june 2004. * * * it honour invite join you, member global supervisory community, seminar future bank supervision. i would like thank host, chairman greenspan, warm welcome hallow hall federal reserve. likewise, u express gratitude world bank, international monetary fund, federal reserve organise seminar. to ensure rich, lively, inform discussions, sponsor assemble impressive array speaker participants, include senior supervisors, central bankers, others 50 countries, achievement demonstrates, fourth time, excellence international inter-organisational cooperation. overview remark the new capital adequacy framework, “basel ii,” figure virtually every discussion today outlook international bank tomorrow. this seminar tackle policy implications. they include new framework’s potential effect risk management within individual firm; competition firms; stability financial sector future supervision; and, broadly, long-term growth economy. what make seminar unique focus perspective country member basel committee particularly emerge market countries. consequently, i try focus remark relevant perspective. i would like discus three sensitive policy question national bank authority market – also elsewhere – raise basel ii. first, basel ii harm flow capital emerge develop markets? second, basel ii appropriate bank markets? and third, basel ii lead deterioration level play field? in answer three questions, i also highlight relate issue new capital framework, complexity procyclicality. in discussion i hear read important issues, i impression perhaps much attention place constraint regulatory capital. while regulatory capital form one overall constraint banks’ activities, usually bind constraint majority individual bank decision take lead institutions, much affect factor economic capital, level competition general costs. at time, little attention seem place another channel influence basel ii: improvement risk management practice foster incentive transparency enhancement contain new framework. in fact, one key innovation basel ii compare basel i. basel ii much set quantitative minimum capital requirements. it establish incentive-based approach risk capital adequacy management, within framework three mutually-supporting pillars: minimum capital requirements, supervisory review transparency. i think basel ii represent unparalleled opportunity bank improve business strategy risk management systems. in view, combination good risk management, strong capital structure improve transparency standard bank system could significantly improve access emerge economy financial markets. this raise two additional group relevant question i also address late presentation: first group relate transition different jurisdiction new framework, second necessary cooperation home host country make implementation effective consistent. bi review 33/2004 1 our discussion topic bear well choose title event: “the international bank system crossroads.” that wonderful image “crossroads” suggest two metaphor keep mind. the immediate image term “crossroads” call mind is, course, place four road meet. it traveller, follow one road point, must reflect select one next three road continue journey. that appropriate metaphor u today. we must evaluate environment bank enter choose way forward enhance supervision contribute safety soundness banks. at time, invent new roads. there already ‘roads’ good practice use lead bank follow support. we might discover second relevant metaphor allow inspire beauty federal reserve’s eccles build architectural reference antiquity. in classical times, scholar divide liberal art seven subjects. the first three relate language form “trivium,” latin mean “three roads.” in contrast, “quadrivium” – latin term “four roads,” also “crossroads” – represent study four subject relate number – namely, arithmetic geometry, also music astronomy. the classical metaphor quadrivium, “crossroads” subject relate numbers, seem equally well suit discussion contemporary bank supervision. lead bank recent year seek augment subjective assessment risk objective formalised, rigorous, numerically orient analytical techniques. after all, good number best friend good judgement. credit scoring, advance statistical analysis, financial model among ever expand range tool credit officer others use lend rigorous insight risk think readily quantifiable. the business bank risk management always art science. still, metaphor crossroad subject relate number remind u that, system supervision remain relevant twenty-first century, must reflect industry’s advance quantify risk develop tool measure manage risk. at conclusion seminar, i hope u return home country deep insight basel ii readiness new approach bank supervision. a spanish proverb remind u “drink nothing without see it; sign nothing without read it.” it spirit i would like begin substance remark think need basel ii. do need basel ii? a know, basel ii attract much attention, segment society, probably reform bank supervision. mainstream newspaper report extensively it. politician view address it. even non-financial business owner discuss extensively. the level public debate remind u bank charge special public trust capital requirement intend safeguard ability discharge trust. bank serve custodian public’s wealth intermediary credit consumer business alike. no bank discharge duty long lack sufficient capital. when capital exhausted, bank fails, leave public authority – taxpayer – responsible make depositor whole again. the 1988 basel accord establish first internationally accept definition measure bank capital. in many ways, 1988 basel accord tremendous success story. perhaps simple apply, adopt 100 countries, include country represent today. a result, become acknowledge one benchmark measure bank’s financial health. while simplicity 1988 accord asset promote acceptance, today simplicity quickly become liability banker supervisor alike. over past 16 years, methodology measure manage risk evolve way architect 1988 accord could anticipated. for one, advance technology, telecommunications, market change way bank collect, measure, manage risks. have gain experience quantify exposure market risk, lead bank today quantify use increasingly reliable estimate credit risk associate particular borrowers. likewise, bank seek quantify reliable manner 2 bi review 33/2004 exposure operational risk, risk loss stem failure internal process system damage cause external disruption. evolution market likewise provide bank tool manage transfer credit risk, securitisation transaction credit derivatives. a risk management become sophisticated, simple static rule 1988 accord become le relevant. lead bank increasingly view old rule burden, constrain ability administer business relative best information practice available today. supervisors, part, le confidence 1988 accord’s measure risk bank engage sophisticate form risk take risk mitigation. by late 1990s, become clear bank supervisor need new capital framework. but one person particular know merely revise minimum requirements. bill mcdonough, previous chairman committee, former president federal reserve bank new york, convince leader industry, central banks, supervisory agency provide incentive advance state art risk management across industry. he seek reduce amount capital hold bank system rather seek increase stability global financial system – goal would benefit banks, broadly business consumers. to work toward great financial stability, basel committee blend several policy approach replace exist capital framework. a i mentioned, basel ii consist three mutually reinforce pillars. the first pillar align minimum capital requirement closely banks’ actual underlie risks. qualify bank rely partly measure risks, rule help create economic incentive bank improve measures. the second pillar – supervisory review – allow supervisor evaluate bank’s assessment risk determine whether assessment seem reasonable. the third pillar, market discipline, strengthen external incentive prudent management. it strengthen ability marketplace participant reward well manage bank penalise poorly manage one enhance transparency banks’ financial reporting. one might say basel ii seek “efficient frontier” policy objective three pillars. each pillar provide something two cannot. each essential achieve overall objective financial stability. the three pillar represent far sophisticate view risk far comprehensive approach supervise bank capital “one-pillar” approach contain 1988 basel accord. a result, committee engage exhaustive – sometimes exhaust – public dialogue bankers, supervisors, observer basel ii’s structure merits. that dialogue critical improve quality new framework, i would like express gratitude take great pain share view concerns. you provide u perspective market countries. you share detail comment proposals. you encourage bank participate consultations. the improvement committee make basel ii would impossible without contributions. indeed, public discussion policymakers emerge market country raise three sensitive questions. i would like turn address question help explain belief basel ii represent opportunity bank supervisor many countries. 1. will basel ii harm international flow capital? the first key question discussion new framework emerge market whether basel ii harm flow capital across border especially emerge markets. in context, observer suggest new capital framework’s heighten sensitivity risk may reduce flow foreign investment develop economies, since exposure economy might typically consider high risk. a i explain, i believe basel ii material effect flow capital. basel ii seek align capital regulation closely banks’ current practice – change way bank actually evaluate risk decide whether invest emerge market economies. to understand answer, must first understand issue may trigger debate. one valid criticism 1988 accord concern rather arbitrary treatment country risk. the 1988 accord assign risk weights, hence capital charges, sovereign government relate borrowers, well bank organisations, base whether country question bi review 33/2004 3 member organisation economic cooperation development. the “oecd club rule,” become known, assign zero percent risk weight exposure sovereign government borrower member oecd, mean capital hold sovereign exposures. in contrast, exposure country assign standard 100% risk weight, equivalent 8% capital charge. the club rule mean help distinguish high low risk sovereign borrower banks. in retrospect, seem unfair way divide world. indeed, oecd member government experience serious economic shock threaten repayment abilities, several non-oecd member government perform extremely well international debt markets. when committee set revise 1988 accord, want resolve arbitrary treatment country risk club rule introduced. our solution basel ii assign risk weights, hence capital charges, exposure sovereign borrower bank reflect measure credit risk. bank standardise approach credit risk determine risk weight exposure sovereign bank base borrowers’ external credit ratings. bank adopt internal ratings-based approach credit risk rely sense credit risk involved. basel ii eliminate arbitrary distinction impose club rule set capital requirement base external internal measure credit risk. yet observer assume risk-sensitive approach might drive capital requirements, also price credit loan emerge market country banks. this assumption debate break down. indeed, argument suggest basel ii reduce flow capital emerge market require u accept view regulatory capital drive loan price – something prove research. in fact, research committee’s discussion bank suggest something else drive loan pricing. when determine price loan, bank consider economic risk associate particular borrower. it factor “economic capital” level competition drive loan pricing, rather regulatory capital. research price international syndicate loan confirm “pricing clearly vary positively credit risk.” that find surprise banker supervisor – bank price loan base borrower’s credit risk probably business long. when apply context sovereign bank borrowers, find suggest loan price already take account credit quality borrowers. study one conclude that, consequently, even country low credit quality likely experience mark contraction capital flows. why would true? it bank manage risk appropriately already consider risk face lend high risk borrower – thus country’s low credit quality already price loan, even exist capital rule today. furthermore, additional element basel ii contribute alleviate concern impact capital flows. let mention reduction capital charge retail lending, residential mortgages, small medium enterprise (exposures € 1 million) well-provisioned past-due loans.1 also, recognition credit risk mitigants collateral guarantee significantly good new framework basel ii. in similar vein, i would like address relate comment i often heard. some observer argue basel ii detrimental effect capital flow emerge market economy new framework recognise diversification benefit characterise investment markets. it true basel ii fall short recognise diversification benefit full credit risk models, although internal-ratings base approach recognise benefit diversification degree assume bank’s asset benefit degree diversification 1 in standardise approach risk-weight residential mortgage 35% instead 50% basel i. for sme’s retail new risk weight 75% versus 100% basel i. past due loan capital charge 50% enough provision (loss reserve > 50%). 4 bi review 33/2004 average, internationally active bank. under evolutionary approach basel ii, committee recognise importance continue active dialogue industry regard performance model comparability across banks, include issue agenda future work. nevertheless, main reason fully recognise diversification effect stage first need see clear evidence many bank robust system place ass quantify effect rely measure diversification daily risk management. of course, system improve future, would happy discus them, “best practice” field good able recognise capital framework. in meantime experience internal credit model provide u highly valuable information. in addition, since loan price predominantly drive regulatory requirements, bank free recognise diversification benefit price calculations. consequently, indeed capture sense benefit diversification credit decision loan price every borrower, whether emerge market country not. from different perspective, i think concern emerge market level capital flow country, also volatility level capital flow inwards. abrupt change capital flow harmful contraction flows. volatility erode confidence business government future supply credit, render long-term plan meaningless. i believe bank adopt especially advance approach credit risk increasingly take longer-term view international investments, stress test requirement ensure consider risk would react certain change market environment. when bank system adequately capitalised, well-managed risk correctly assess within appropriate time horizon, financial system become stable, le procyclical, good able promote sustainable growth, resilient period distress. risk assessment process formalise discipline may facilitate early detection deviation mistakes, may facilitate make smooth correction early stage, reduce probability sudden change investment decisions. this, turn, benefit emerge market economy improve degree confidence future level capital inflows. procyclicality this much relate discussion procyclicality, important issue committee take address seriously. in particular, suggest internal ratings-based approach drive cost credit borrower precisely time supply falling, namely downturn business cycle. this lead concern basel ii may exacerbate fragility emerge markets. there degree procyclicality inherent bank behaviour. the question consider whether basel ii unduly exacerbate behaviour. in response, i believe concern respect may reflect perception i already challenge – regulatory capital charge directly drive credit price decisions. a i noted, research suggest economic capital drive credit pricing, regulatory capital. consequently, basel ii simply align regulatory capital rule closely banks’ actual practices; change price credit facilities. nonetheless, committee recognise risk-sensitive capital framework cause capital requirement fluctuate exposure borrower’s creditworthiness strengthen weakens. to mitigate excessively wide swing capital requirements, committee flatten risk weight curve apply “internal ratings-based approach” credit risk small change credit risk lead large change capital requirements. at time, committee require bank adopt advance approach credit risk adopt forward-looking approach credit risk management require meaningful stress test credit portfolios. stress test intend help bank understand exposure credit risk may change future sudden shock affect market way. bi review 33/2004 5 2. be basel ii appropriate bank emerge market countries? the first key question address basel ii’s potential impact investment capital flow countries. the second key question whether basel ii even appropriate bank system emerge markets, i would like address now. in view, principle vision supervision basel ii valuable supervisor bank markets. i must acknowledge advance approach risk measurement mainly intend internationally active bank great potential increase systemic risk, demand term investment pre-suppose banks’ systems, qualitative requirement set. the 1988 accord create initially apply consistent set rule globally competitive banks, shortcoming exist rule today especially evident context highly sophisticate organisations. however, many supervisor apply 1988 accord le complex organisation may active mainly even domestic markets. be basel ii appropriate bank well? i think great level diversity market financial system worldwide make difficult – perhaps even counterproductive – try specify single rule could apply bank countries. fortunately, basel ii move away “one-size-fits-all” rule. in fact, basel ii’s menu approach provide supervisor bank range option make basic standard readily available many kind organisation country face different economic circumstances. it also make great supervisory cooperation essential, order ensure consistent implementation. one concern express many time excessive reliance place external credit agency bank sufficiently robust internal rat systems. the committee mindful concern supervisor uncomfortable external rat countries, option whereby corporate claim weight 100% sovereign bank risk weight accord risk score export credit agencies, case need reliance external credit agency all. indeed, discussion colleague counterpart country outside committee instrumental revise capital framework. thank consultations, endeavour address several broad issue new framework, i set now. complexity one inevitable by-product design comprehensive three-pillar framework built-in option suit different circumstance increase complexity. the member basel committee certainly recognise complexity virtue supervisory guidelines. it far easy enforce simple rule complicate one. however, achieve balance simplicity comparability, also simplicity risk sensitivity particularly difficult industry like banking, culture constant innovation make tall order regulator develop simple rule fit bank product service permutations. paraphrase einstein ‘a good framework simple possible, simpler’ much complexity basel ii actually stem diversity exist real world many option rule provide. many option reflect banks’ request address rich variety risk practice existence today; bank organisation think “blanket rule” would unfairly burden them. by provide range options, good able fit regulatory framework bank’s profile, rather way around. similarly, complexity basel ii stem detail provide clarify expectation bank supervisor promote level play field. many banker supervisor ask committee provide great detail think danger exist difference interpretation arise across jurisdictions. we work hard past year clarify rules, simplify think complex, provide option wish use simple approach. in fact, basel committee demonstrate annex third consultative paper, supervisor select option would result simple set rule specify 12 page text. that approximately equal length original 1988 accord. 6 bi review 33/2004 the “simplified standardise approach”, call it, intend useful country wish adopt option available new framework. the trade-off, however, reflect fact policy balance stake simplicity risk-sensitivity; one choose simple rules, cost le sensitivity risk hence great conservatism capital requirements. 3. competition consistency application. another broad concern committee work address basel ii’s impact global competition. in particular, ask whether bank choose basel ii’s advance approach enjoy benefit choose simple approaches. others wonder whether bank remain 1988 accord time disadvantaged. to respond concerns, understand adopt advance approach automatically reduce bank’s capital requirements. in fact, risk sensitive capital framework intend align capital requirement closely risk. this could mean capital requirement advance bank may actually rise relative current rule bank’s exposure actually risky measure 1988 accord would suggested. furthermore national supervisor may set high capital requirement imply basel i, perhaps even high imply basel ii, depend risk environment. for bank experience reduction capital result basel ii, observer question whether low requirement might provide certain advantage make easy bank acquire bank share benefits. history suggest particular concern may unfounded. in paper publish past february federal reserve, researcher report find convince evidence past change capital requirement substantial impact merger banks. the issue competition bank also come context competition countries. here, remember basel ii intend help ensure international competition bank market drive strength bank, rather difference country’s rules. one way committee seek promote consistent application new framework provide bank supervisor detail requirement necessary. a i already mentioned, detail may add appearance length complexity basel ii, small price pay great consistency level play field. however, give need framework adapt wide range circumstances, cooperation among supervisor clearly important tool achieve appropriate level consistency. the committee establish work group supervisors, call accord implementation group, “aig,” share information implementation effort among basel committee member countries. the aig work supervisor well, include core principle liaison group, group supervisor many country share view exchange information. by promote share information practical issues, aig’s discussion help foster great consistency implementation application new framework across countries. for example, thank work aig, committee able publish think implementation supervisory review process – pillar 2 – home-host co-operation implementation framework. let come back latter point. give internationalisation bank group increase reliance group-wide risk management, clear cross-border implementation framework complex 1988. the aig actively discuss issue, august 2003 committee publish set principle promote close practical co-operation information exchange among supervisors. the principle re-emphasise traditional responsibility home host supervisors, also responsibility continue new framework basis enhance co-operation. more recently, begin may, committee publish elaboration principles. of course, recognise objective seek cannot achieve overnight dependent build good relation trust supervisors. a part effort, aig meet core principle liaison group’s work group capital bi review 33/2004 7 middle month. among things, two group discus cross-border issue case study exchange current think implementation strategies. i believe every effort initiative improve communication supervisor around world strongly encouraged. 4. move new framework these example basel ii improve make suitable national circumstance domestic bank system many countries. the member committee i recognise, consistently stressed, national authority decide adopt basel ii. adopt basel ii timetable member country basel committee feasible countries. in fact, basel ii may less priority compare ongoing effort promote fundamental safety soundness country’s bank system. all u must think long hard state markets, bank systems, supervisory structure determine ready adopt new approach bank supervision basel ii implies. of course, committee hope that, time, country adopt framework. we want ready. and, ready, want adopt option approach appropriate circumstances. for country wish adopt basel ii may yet ready, i would suggest three-stage approach transition basel ii. these stage could categorise (1) strengthen supervisory infrastructure; (2) introduce reinforce three pillars; (3) make transition 1988 accord basel ii. this three-stage process recognise basel ii intend simply ensure compliance new set capital rules. rather, basel ii intend enhance quality risk management. to achieve goal, basel ii must build foundation sound supervisory system. such foundation include successfully implement basel committee’s “core principle effective bank supervision,” include provision operational autonomy supervisory authority, adequate supervisory resources, regulatory remedial powers, sufficient legal framework. likewise, sound account provision standard critical ensure capital ratio - however calculate - reflect meaningfully bank’s ability absorb losses. establish solid foundation sound supervisory, legal, account system constitute essential first stage process move new supervisory framework. secondly, i would encourage supervisor consider three pillar basel ii could already enhance jurisdiction. supervisor need await formal adoption basel ii start introduce use principle three pillars. on contrary, incorporate principle excellent preparation adopt basel ii future. for example, supervisor might encourage move towards system risk-based supervision, develop skill assess quality bank’s risk management ability ass risk exposures. at time, bank could remind responsibility develop process evaluate capital need strategy maintain capital levels, line principle pillar 2. with regard principle market discipline pillar 3, supervisor country may wish focus initially ensure baseline level disclosure across banks. this might include discuss banks, investor user financial information information need tool available supervisor tailor requirement accordingly. in view, two preliminary stage provide excellent preparation “final” stage move basel ii. the basel committee welcome effort many country already undertake enhance quality bank supervision encourage prudent management bank sector. we support work would like contribute efforts. the basel committee, member agencies, financial stability institute bank international settlement long participate regional train initiative intend help promote supervisors’ understand international bank standard new capital framework. the committee’s accord implementation group likewise engage outreach supervisor non-member countries, include core principle liaison group. i chair special session discussion early year i personally commit improve dialogue. 8 bi review 33/2004 we look forward work institutions, include world bank international monetary fund, assist supervisor journey come crossroad bank supervision. conclusion in remark morning, intention offer insight basel committee belief basel ii important step embrace new, incentives-based approach supervision. i also want discus keep supervisory framework up-to-date late advance risk measurement technique risk management practices. in answer sensitive question i hear banker policymakers countries, i seek emphasise basel committee seek appropriate balance basel ii develop simple rule maintain sensitivity bank’s actual underlie risks. we intend align basel ii’s capital requirement closely banks’ actual economic capital needs. consequently, think align regulatory framework banks’ contemporary risk measurement technique make lend pattern volatile. nor think harm competition dry capital flow emerge market countries. the committee work ensure new framework contain sufficient option simple form rule basic principle apply many kind bank organisation many countries. basel ii present excellent opportunity emerge develop markets. by stimulate bank upgrade improve systems, business models, capital strategies, risk management system disclosure standards, basel ii improve overall efficiency ability compete globally. it help reduce risk premium emerge develop market help ensure stability financial system. still, clear that, accomplish intentions, new capital framework different approach supervision know far. it require hard work parts. banker must work ensure risk management system meet standard qualify use sophisticate measure risk. for part, supervisor must ensure comfortable banks’ progress. but must also ready supervise comprehensive capital framework. we need share information issue encounter move 1988 accord three pillar new framework. we need compare note advance bank achieve measure manage risk implication advance may have, capital framework, also safety soundness bank system, future health economies. thank cooperation federal reserve, world bank, imf, privilege enjoy rare opportunity engage multilateral dialogue fellow supervisor 50 country room. i encourage make best use unusual occasion ask questions, share views, pledge cooperation – across agencies, across jurisdictions, across markets. together, good encourage bank organisation improve risk management. together, good secure benefit great financial stability sustainable economic growth all. bi review 33/2004 9 timothy f geithner: perspective u financial system remark mr timothy f geithner, president chief executive officer federal reserve bank new york, economic club new york, new york, 27 may 2004. * * * it pleasure join today economic club new york. and it’s pleasure share program john thain. today i want talk u.s. financial system point transition u.s. economy. the u.s. financial system currently enjoy period considerable strength. financial institution strong. financial innovation spur advance risk management. market practice surround key product otc derivative strengthened. and industry’s payment infrastructure improve additional safeguard new clear settlement arrangements. the system remarkably resilient face range recent challenges. the recent record reassuring, financial system without vulnerability. period relatively favorable economic financial conditions, experience today, good time reflect capacity system withstand future stress. i want focus today development improve overall stability system, also continue challenges, implication risk management supervision. the history shock u.s. financial system highly varied. even past two decades, see range systemic event wide diversity source characteristics. we’ve see credit boom credit concentration result substantial loss bank industry, area vary commercial real estate, energy, agriculture, emerge market sovereigns. we see shock reflect sharp substantial movement interest rates, exchange rates, asset prices. some event associate deterioration macroeconomic performance. some occur period relatively strong economic growth. some drive abrupt change expectation inflation monetary policy associate change level interest rate shape yield curve. often event follow period accommodative financial conditions, rapid credit growth, sustain rise asset prices, low volatility price financial assets. many event self-reinforcing element, initial change interest rate asset price amplify subsequent action market participant face unanticipated losses. financial leverage also amplify factor many events. in instances, unexpected pattern correlation movement asset price credit loss across borrowers. these experience lead change risk management practices, supervision, capacity central bank contain systemic risk. these response reduce overall vulnerability system type shock we’ve experienced. moreover, we’ve experience variety different type stress, overall risk may lower. but recent history also suggest need maintain degree humility caution capacity anticipate nature dynamic future stress financial system. how strong resilient u.s. financial system today? our sense system quite strong resilient relative recent past. the major financial institution core system profitable well capitalized. the total risk-based capital ratio ten large u.s.-owned bank hold company average 12 percent past two years, slight increase relative prevail level since mid-1990s. at year-end 2003, nearly every bank country meet regulatory standard consider “well capitalized”, few 100 - represent le 1 percent bank industry asset - fail meet standards. while risk-based capital ratio always provide accurate picture true capital strength, especially large complex institutions, statistic nonetheless broadly indicative strong underlie capital position industry. bi review 33/2004 1 robust capitalization important capital, along earnings, provide first line defense losses. counterparties customer le likely lose confidence pull back well-capitalized institution wake large loss negative event. capital, effect, help protect firm “runs,” traditional “runs” short-term fund liquidity issue, gradual, damage “runs” franchise value, customer turn elsewhere service question long-term viability firm. consolidation result large diverse financial institution core u.s. financial system. deregulation enable firm good optimize scale, geographic spread, scope operations. the result creation extremely large diverse financial institution high earn capacity. in 2003, 18 u.s. bank hold company six security firm earn $1 billion, five large bank hold company earn combine total nearly $46 billion, 40 percent bank industry total. along capital, earn provide substantial cushion absorb losses, significantly moderate consequence adverse event. the wide scope activity great domestic international geographic diversification firm also provide stable revenue base. advance risk management also enable firm hedge risk effectively and, aggregate, disperse risk efficiently across firm financial system. give advance data collection risk modeling, bank financial firm able good risk-based pricing. firm capacity view credit key risk portfolio perspective rather isolation, lead efficient risk share good capital allocation. in concert good risk modeling, securitization credit derivative facilitate dispersion credit risk across firm across sector financial system. these change lead significant risk transfer within bank system, well net transfer credit risk commercial bank financial intermediaries. a result, believe see efficient risk allocation within financial system whole, since risk transfer firm diversify, rather reinforce, risk arise core business part financial system significantly le leverage bank security firms, institutional investor mutual funds. these risk management advance accompany growth key derivative market low cost hedge market-price-sensitive position activities. one important example growth market long-dated swaps, use bank hedge mortgage security whole loans. the notional value long-dated interest rate derivative (those maturity 5 years) triple since end 1998, considerably fast growth comparable shorter-dated instruments. the growth market reflect substantial increase hedge capacity, “wider pipeline” seem likely facilitate ease market adjust condition stress. growth otc derivative market accompany welcome improvement market practice. since turmoil 1998, financial firm make significant stride sophistication ass manage counterparty credit exposure arise otc derivative transactions. rather use broad “rule thumb” method industry norm, otc derivative dealer commonly ass counterparty exposure portfolio basis use sophisticate approach capture current mark-to-market exposure potential future exposure could arise change contracts’ underlie rate prices. these model make possible - cannot course guarantee - appropriately conservative assessment potential reduction future exposure provide net agreement collateral arrangements. dealer also make significant stride develop employ sophisticate exact way stress test exposures. take together, approach result realistic measure counterparty exposure good management counterparty risk. beyond improve exposure assessments, use collateral much prevalent past. for instance, survey isda suggest share fix income derivative exposure cover collateral increase 40 percent 55 percent since 2002. collateral almost universally post counterparties except high credit ratings. there also significant improvement legal certainty surround collateral arrangements. among legal advance great clarity enforceability right net closeout event default counterparty, good clarity master documentation regard right remedies, good harmonization domestically internationally key provision different 2 bi review 33/2004 master net agreement different product might hedge one another. these, combine wide prevalence collateral arrangement overall, provide derivative dealer great protection event counterparty default expand capacity enter transaction normal market conditions. the development new clear arrangement also strengthen resiliency crucial payment settlement system provide backbone u.s. financial system. exist payment settlement system also implement improve safeguard impact default system participant, also potential impact external events, experience september 11. overall, change suggest that, fundamental level, significant stride make enhance resiliency u.s. financial system. high level overall capital, great diversification credit exposure, increase use collateral, strong payment settlement system infrastructure make financial system strong today been. with favorable developments, however, come range challenges. i want discus implications. this mean be, not, comprehensive list. the first challenge complexity. with financial growth innovation, see dramatic increase complexity risk management challenge. the frontier innovation inevitably advance somewhat ahead pace improvement risk management supervisory infrastructure. the model use inform credit judgments, measure exposure, price risk new instrument trade strategy definition le ground experience. the process assign fair market value much subjective le amenable objective verification. consensus appropriate account treatment le well established. a complexity risk grown, demand firm understand exposure might evolve, especially time market stress. a example, basis risk - hedge position partially offset one another - increasingly important concern many firms, especially deal complex product options. assess manage complex risk require risk management tool commensurate level sophistication. in particular, development technique stress test scenario analysis method translate stress test result concrete risk management outcome important area additional progress. the risk management challenge complicate nature institution core system. large, diversify financial institution comprise many separate, highly specialize business units, approach track manage risk exposures. integrate across business develop firm-wide, portfolio risk perspective important challenge, one many guise within large, complex firm. for example, manage complex pattern risk exposure derive membership multiple payment security settlement systems, loss-sharing arrangement generate contingent exposure among members, one small facet broad challenge face firm today. the difficulty manage conflict deal customer also significantly enhance large, diversify institutions, give multiple role play. more generally, increasingly challenge many large, diverse financial institution get accurate picture aggregate exposure individual creditor business contact come many different source within firm. this difficulty compound different type exposure functionally equivalent manage different way different part firm. different unit within single firm frequently trade transfer risk one another, add layer difficulty assess aggregate exposure give creditor counterparty. the increase scale scope operation institution core system rapid growth complex transaction place extraordinary burden internal control, compliance, risk management infrastructure. this “arms race” finance. it challenge ensure strength infrastructure control within financial institution stay abreast pace change complexity risk tool manage - process supervisor actively reinforce. a second issue relate degree concentration core financial intermediation functions. the two large government-sponsored enterprise mortgage market hold 36 percent agency mortgage-backed securities, compare le 10 percent end 1993. the bi review 33/2004 3 exposure bank gse’s, primarily hold gse debt fund mb positions, consequence large. two institution account essentially market clear function government security agencies, well tri-party repo activity. a relatively small number institution account large share activity over-the-counter derivative business generally, well certain category risk-transfer instruments. these development different sources. some result public policy choices. some consequence economy scale inherent businesses. overall, competitive financial system, large diversity institutions, therefore strong overall system financial intermediation. a general matter, however, increase size institution relative part financial system necessarily magnify potential consequence mistake infrastructure failure institutions. they sufficiently large le room maneuver adjust position response change risk without adversely affect market whole. increase concentration market reinforce incentive large institution counterparties manage risk great degree caution. supervisor role here, too, provide additional reinforcement case private incentive seem generate appropriately judicious responses. a third challenge increase opportunity exist today risk leverage migrate to, build in, part financial system subject direct supervision regulation capital leverage ratios. accord estimates, asset management hedge fund doubled, $750 billion, since 1998, number funds, stand 6,000. we reliable overall measure degree leverage institutions, though interest note intermediary serve prime broke hedge fund believe overall leverage fund low early 1998. give growth market, credit exposure bank security firm overall hedge fund sector may high 1998, likely spread widely across funds. while may well diversity type strategy hedge fund follow, also considerable clustering, raise prospect large move market condition lead general withdrawal “crowded” trades. overall, hedge fund play beneficial role u.s. financial system. they contribute one define strength financial markets: ease match capital idea innovation. they represent one aspect broader, quite favorable, trend toward great diversity participant u.s. financial market respect, contribute broad spread risk. but also present risk financial system. the extent risk present system whole depend significantly prudence institution enable increase leverage. the improvement market practice manage counterparty credit risk since 1998 encouraging, important firm continue strengthen disciplines. at fundamental level, intermediary provide credit hedge fund need ensure term condition provision credit - include contingent credit increase feature prime brokerage arrangement - appropriately reflect risk involved. what implication challenge qualification is, overall, favorable picture strength u.s. financial system? one persistent feature financial history discipline tend ebb flow degree change financial economic conditions. even though see broad-based, secular improvement risk management practice past decade, competitive pressure search return low interest rate environment lead relaxation internal discipline even potential risk balance sheet increases. there number factor suggest force lead build major imbalance would present major source strain incentive diminish change financial environment. net borrow non-financial corporate sector quite moderate, especially compare late 1990s. the financial position sector strong, decline leverage, particularly small firms, tend highly levered. credit household sector course rise quite considerably, debt service burden still look relatively manageable. net credit growth emerge market sovereign quite moderate relative past periods. while growth commercial bank asset pick recent quarters, also remain pace late 1990s. 4 bi review 33/2004 a financial market build expectation gradual return normal monetary financial conditions, see adjustment range credit spreads. a range survey report time dealer financial intermediary generally reduce exposure rise interest rates. these adjustment healthy. that impact relatively contain far may suggest borrower lender le overextend relative past periods, despite sustain period accommodative financial conditions. the fact process adjustment relatively modest overall impact also reflect fact occur environment grow confidence sustainability expansion consensus forecast quite moderate inflation. even so, risk manager need continue attentive implication evolution monetary financial conditions. this overall picture suggest supervisory community continue focus follow priorities: • ensure overall capital level provide sufficiently strong cushion risk. • encourage firm continue strengthen internal management control infrastructure relate risk management, compliance function, system technology. • improve quality integrity public disclosure. • continue work toward integrate framework supervision across functional line financial activity within markets, globally well. for federal reserve, mean devote even great attention institution constitute center financial system, well clearance settlement backbone. it mean need make great investment look risk financial system whole, origin banks. and mean continue intensify cooperation supervisory regulatory authorities. the u.s. financial system course strong economy whole. overall, fundamental u.s. economy look quite strong. but size fiscal deficit, risk pose large external imbalance, place great burden would otherwise case credibility u.s. monetary policy. in context, particularly important preserve high degree confidence seem exist u.s. monetary policy respond appropriately evolve balance risk overall economic outlook, particularly maintain price stability. this critically important sustain current expansion, sustain confidence u.s. financial market time. and get monetary policy right one important thing contribute financial stability well. bi review 33/2004 5 jean-claude trichet: announcement basel ii open remark mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank chairman g10 governor head

albeit slowly. deflationary pressure easing. the external sector active run substantial current account surplus. the residential property market, wealth many community depends, bottom fall trend last

risk face bank hong kong? or, put question large context, longer-term process shape bank sector carry risk well opportunities? we hkma identify internal exercise still ongoing i would like share today preliminary view five them. they are: • structural shift bank sector • china risk • technology risk • diversification risk • change international standards. in remainder talk, i shall deal area turn, focus think bank hong kong tackle process risks, le correspond supervisory response strategies, case still developed. my main message that, bank need focus clearly short-term risk i already outlined, lose sight fundamental force shape landscape bank sector year come. if take force account, individual bank face grow risks, could danger lose competitiveness. structural shift bank sector first, structural shift bank sector. over past year hkma encourage bank consider consolidation way improve competitiveness - technology, among factors, obviously move optimum size retail bank towards large end. the bank industry respond positively: number locally incorporate bank fall 31 three year ago 24 present, result, i happy say, consolidation abandonment hong kong. a expected, various consolidation exercise produce economy scale intend and, cases, immediate financial benefit institution concerned. a consolidation continues, subsidiarisation local operation major foreign retail banks, structure bank sector become increasingly polarised. at one end several large banks; end number much small players. the small player increasingly face two disadvantages: one hand find difficult compete; hand, find opportunity consolidation dwindle time, number possible target consolidation declines. it may quite right classify structural shift purely long-term risk. in fact, trend already effect consolidation industry whole begin see soon. small banks, wish continue thrive, should, matter priority, carefully review strategic direction. they should, example, consider whether desirable grow size develop niche players. neither option easy one. the opportunity organic growth local market limited, competition niche operation intense. 2 bi review 37/2004 china risk the second important

mainland market. let u overlook movement opposite direction, mainland bank seek enter hong kong market. on macro level, renminbi move measure pace towards full convertibility, seem inevitable increase proportion balance sheet bank hong kong would denominate currency. the opportunity arise development promising, carry risk well. the grow bank relationship mainland hong kong provide important business opportunity bank places. the question hong kong bank seek take advantage process whether requisite expertise properly analyse business compliance risks. failure task additionally give rise substantial operational reputation risk, particularly bank recently become eligible cepa set branch mainland. so far, medium-sized bank seek benefit cepa primarily follow customer mainland china. this simple business model pose much risk bank concerned. but bank contemplate aggressive expansion plans, tap local consumer market, need least aware risk involve position manage prudently. there general important aspect process grow bank relationship mainland hong kong. this process likely characterise policy shift frequent bank environment familiar with. these policy shift - mostly mainland rather hong kong, monetary well regulatory policy - inevitable feature monetary financial system go reform liberalisation. and absence deep sophisticate financial market mainland provide signal instruments, task risk identification management associate frequent normal policy shift is, put mildly, difficult one. an ability understand, closely monitor anticipate monetary financial market development mainland therefore crucial, bank u supervisor. i urge bank put necessary efforts. insofar concerned, i think developed, limit way, ability will, past, share bank community analysis bank continually adjust operation meet change market regulatory needs. technology risk the third set force arise banks’ increase use of, rather reliance on, technology. we see spate fake bank website attempt email scam past year: indeed, rate discovery case relevant hong kong average 1.4 per month past 13 months. it point report customer hong kong take attempt fraud. nevertheless, proliferation fake website indicate careful precaution constant vigilance necessary. and area technology-related crime - atm skim fraud - victims, hong kong overseas. increase security heighten customer awareness, believe, help defeat form crime: new case hong kong seven months. even so, elementary, “low-tech” nature fraud demonstrate also many dimension banks’ vulnerability technology. in addition protection technology-related crime, it framework bank also require business continuity plan (or bcp). bank hong kong make great stride bcp preparation onslaught y2k bug. although onslaught never came, soon remind importance bcp 9-11 attack, alert u need robustness payment, clear settlement systems, among things. then outbreak sars last year put bcp capability bank hong kong real test. i please say contingency arrangement bank - whether technical personnel nature - perform well difficult time. nevertheless, recurrence disaster unpredictable nature always feature bcp continuous review. indeed, probability occurrence event seem increased, along heighten geo-political tension trend globalisation, trade market also terrorism disease. bi review 37/2004 3 a area fall broadly technology risk come outsourcing. continue pressure profitability doubt result bank seek outsource operation lower-cost centre outside hong kong. this turn give rise additional operational risk banks, include risk service outage leakage confidential customer data. my main observation recent experience handle technology risk bank management adopt proactive approach towards increase overall robustness it environment, crime prevention bcp perspectives. in deal it-related incidents, notice concern sometimes express bank management likelihood cause unnecessary public panic matter give publicity. many prefer deal problem quietly. the desire cautious avoid negative publicity quite understandable. however, find that, far cause panic, insistence publicity helpful alert member public nature risk expose bank customer protect themselves. it enhance public education issue hand promote exercise degree care bank customer situation demands, protect also help protect integrity system. interestingly, nowadays, sometimes receive report fake web-sites member public even bank affect become aware them. diversification risk the fourth major force shape industry continue effort bank diversify income source. this ongoing inevitable trend give increase competition bank market, gather pace recent year response increase pressure interest income. the net interest margin retail bank hong kong whole substantially decline 2.19% 1997 annualised level 1.67% first quarter 2004. the new source income include notably sale investment insurance products. the key challenge bank simply whether capable manage risk arise new intermediary activities. this particularly when, encourage advance technology, range product offer customer expand plain vanilla type complex structure instruments. furthermore, awareness customer consumer right increased, thus expose bank great compliance, legal reputation risk venture new area activities. we see recent year abundance case mis-selling product bank even jurisdiction develop financial markets. bank need properly equip themselves, include substantially upgrade compliance internal audit processes, order rise challenge. international standard the fifth set influence affect bank industry number key international standard introduce next years. these include regulatory account standards, basle ii standard prominent minds. another example implementation ia 39. the adoption standard profound implication operation bank hong kong. time limited, is, all, luncheon speech, i shall go detail standards. the point make that, international financial centre, alternative implement standard fully possibly soon international agreement reach them. many standard be, put mildly, quite onerous. in connection, i wish ensure hkma adopt proactive approach participate relevant international standard set forum influence standard set process best interest hong kong. we also consult widely hong kong. insofar bank concerned, clear need bank management allocate adequate resource process implementation, involve substantial change it system compliance arrangements. for basle ii, example, bank act misapprehension simply sub-contract implementation process third party service vendors, external auditors. active involvement bank management crucial ensure most, international standard properly incorporate daily operation banks, especially since bank may face different focus challenge process. 4 bi review 37/2004 conclusion i draw attention five process likely impact bank industry future, already impact. each will, course, different degree impact depend nature operation bank - though i think fair say bank ignore them. to sure, face important implication limit resource bank have. in formulate business strategy come five years, essential bank management take account process plan affairs. this go hkma well, since important implication manner could perform supervisory function effectively. a i mention earlier, currently carry internal review subject. a result internal review, may need u make adjustment supervisory policies; be, usual necessary, full consultation industry proceed. bi review 37/2004 5 jean-claude trichet: the international financial architecture - stand? speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, conference “dollars, debt deficit - 60 year bretton woods”, madrid, 14 june 2004. * * * it great pleasure madrid invitation banco de españa international monetary fund. the 60th anniversary bretton wood institution indeed important opportunity take stock key events, development issue shape shape international financial system. let thank organisers, especially host jaime caruana, set interest programme conference encompass key topics. tonight, i would like offer think question “the international financial architecture - stand?” in remarks, i first short look back change international architecture time, concentrate reform effort undertake four areas, namely institutional setup, transparency best practices, regulation financial market crisis prevention resolution. let briefly look change international financial architecture time. the key aim today’s policy maker change compare bretton wood time - been, still is, global prosperity stability - environment act change profoundly. the founder imf world bank want create institution prevent country fall back autarky protectionism help raise growth increase stability world fix exchange rate still large degree capital controls. today strive stability international financial system world free capital flow grow importance private flow increase trade financial integration. among major factor take account, i would like mention particular: • the financial globalisation phenomenon: capital market liberalisation, domestically internationally, technological advance buoyant financial innovation contribute set totally unknown degree financial globalisation - great benefits, also new risks. • the policy responsibility still lie mainly sovereign states; thus, challenge promote global financial stability largely national action enlighten coordinate large degree intimate international co-operation. • a large consensus give private sector market central role one hand, rely upon sound public institution provide market participant appropriate environment hand. this shift direct public involvement private activity particular strike look financial flow emerge markets: 1980s, official flow dominant, reach average 60% total flow emerge markets. by contrast, 1990s saw dramatic increase private flows, average account around 85% (in period 1990 2003). equally strike shift bank loan negotiable security major finance tool develop countries. • the integration european union, reinforce introduction euro, increase economic, monetary financial stability region constitute today world’s large trade partner second large economy. the eu also crucial anchor transition process central eastern europe, foster stability prosperity region. the dynamic today’s world call continue adjustment global level. new challenge add exist ones, poverty reduction. new actor gain prominence international scene, develop emerge market become progressively full participant globalise economy. the financial crisis 1980s 1990s, characterise large sudden private financial flow reversals, mark powerful contagion phenomenon demonstrate potential actual vulnerability newly globalise financial system, lead ambitious reform agenda strengthen international financial architecture. bi review 37/2004 1 let focus lesson crisis 1990s ensue work international financial architecture. on basis experience mexican crisis 1994/95, g7 summit halifax june 1995 initiate work improve crisis prevention management. it call improve transparency, level individual country imf, strengthen imf surveillance. the halifax summit also point importance effective financial regulation, market-reinforced prudential supervision enhance international co-operation among regulator supervisors. a crisis management, concrete proposal present rey report g10 minister governor may 1996. work step aftermath asian crises, reveal vulnerability national international financial systems. but importantly, crisis late 1990s show systemic change world’s financial market require systematic change policy framework underlie international financial system. almost decade later, say many proposal implemented. let focus four different areas, i consider important: the first area concern international institutional set-up, which, view, strengthen significantly since 1990s. the exist international financial institutions, particular imf, world bank bi maintain central role system. but subject several change sharpen respective focus, reinforce policy advice financial support, enhance transparency accountability strengthen governance. the bretton wood institutions, particularly imf, undergo profound change adapt new environment. in addition, new forum create response widen number actor global economy grow importance international financial markets. the creation g20 1999 constitute view decisive highly welcome step reflect adequately newly globalise economy. the g20 turn international forum appropriate dialogue consensus build economy systemic influence, whether industrialised, emerging, transition. equally important financial stability forum, first informal group fully recognise existence global integrate economic financial system. it also first forum set goal systemic optimisation subcomponents system, whether bank surveillance, insurance surveillance, security market control, account rules, good practice public private sectors, function major market places, governance ifis etc. at regional level, european union establish whole universe arrangement co-operation constantly adjust change need european institution become increasingly involve international scene, instance eu-us regulatory dialogue. overall, improve governance international institution optimise work informal group always remain move target give entity permanently adapt change environment. however, change introduce recent years, foundation international financial system strengthen considerably. the second area i would like highlight regard work enhance transparency promote best practices, significant progress achieve number fields. indeed, wide-spread consensus developed, consider reliable timely information economic financial data precondition well-functioning markets, since facilitate good risk assessment management hence strengthen market discipline. the imf’s special standard dissemination economic financial data become widely recognise benchmark large increase number country subscribed. there presumption imf paper article iv consultation fund programme published. international code good practice agree upon, one transparency fiscal policy transparency monetary financial polices. moreover, countries’ compliance 12 important standard code regularly examine imf world bank so-called roscs (reports observance standard codes), many make publicly available positive impact market’s assessment country concerned.1 i consider progress make field transparency asian crisis one 1 the imf world bank recognise 12 standard useful operational work. these comprise accounting; auditing; anti-money launder counter finance terrorism (aml/cft); bank supervision; 2 bi review 37/2004 main explanation absence contagion emerge world argentine crisis erupted. transparency private sector also crucial well-functioning international financial markets. reliable timely company information one key element transparency, provide mainly financial statements. recent corporate scandal bring mind crucial role account standard play respect. in context, i attach great importance reform international account standard (ias) key role standard advance european single market. the ias, apply list company eu, expect major impact european bank system. the bank sector particularly affect propose valuation rule financial instrument rule disclosure. the ecb strong interest debate mainly focus contribute maintenance financial stability. thus, primary objective reform full support aim minimise gap report information true risk profile company. i also fully aware complexity stem interrelation account standard report scheme supervisory statistical purposes. however, proposal give rise concern also within ecb. in particular, proposal relate extensive use fair value raise concern possible adverse implication volatility bank income and, eventually, bank behaviour financial stability. a consequence, ecb contribute debate, highlight concern show relevance. the recent proposal iasb move direction limit use fair value item reliably measured. the revise proposal help avoid undesirable consequence artificial increase income volatility. at current juncture, ecb carry exercise check likely impact new standard. while issue apply financial markets, eu face particular challenge relate advancement single market. the introduction harmonise eu rule regard setting-up financial statement consider crucial step towards integration financial market euro area european union. indeed, improve comparability disclose information would facilitate cross-border investment market integration. thus, 2002 european parliament council adopt regulation require list company prepare consolidate financial statement accordance ia 1st january 2005. a specific endorsement process place ensure legal certainty consistency eu public policy concerns. this process already allow endorse ia exception two standard concern recognition, measurement disclosure financial instruments. recently, order deal remain controversial issues, commission take initiative establish high-level dialogue constituency interest high quality account principles. i remain confident positive impact prudently implement international account standard stability efficiency financial market eu. the third area relate strengthen financial regulation industrialise countries. here, let recall recent crisis expose weakness risk management practice part creditor investor industrial countries, point importance financial market regulation supervision. we aware importance effective financial regulation supervision maintain financial stability protect consumers, also light increase complexity financial service products. let say one word one important aspect financial regulation, reform basel capital accord, coin basel ii. i convince host, mr. caruana, chairman basel committee bank supervision, could hand fill even elaborate main feature reform. from i gather, effort bear fruit may expect final text hopefully endorse g10 governor head bank supervisory authority forthcoming weeks. the basel ii reform key importance. new bold development bank industry ultimate reason engage reform. corporate governance; data dissemination; fiscal transparency; insolvency creditor rights; insurance supervision; monetary financial policy transparency; payment systems; security regulation. bi review 37/2004 3 the ecb express various occasion supportive stance new framework. the ecb also among first point possible macro-financial implication bank prudential scheme, highlight potential procyclical effect might induce framework rely comprehensive real time risk analysis. these concern take account final version new framework aim neutral cycle. look ahead, recognise stand begin road. the success reform crucially hinge sound implementation new framework require strong coordinate effort among supervisory authority global basis. with regard eu context, new institutional set base lamfalussy framework comprise two-tier structure regulatory supervisory committee expect play important role ensure uniform flexible eu regulation consistent implementation result convergence supervisory practices. a fourth last area, i would like mention crisis prevention management. of course, various effort i mention far conducive prevent crisis happening. however, crisis prevention primarily rest every single country strengthen macroeconomic policy financial systems. in context, experience past decade highlight crucial importance well-functioning domestic rules, regulation institution namely legal framework, regulatory system, enforcement mechanisms, authority shape permit optimal function market economy financial markets. this includes, particular, central bank independence, rule monetary policy fiscal policies, appropriate supervisory framework authorities. there strong evidence link well-functioning institution good governance positive economic social outcomes. institutional factor appear important productive factor endowment explanation determine cross-country difference overall level development. i confident lesson fee improve domestic policy-making emerge market economies, make resilient withstand shocks. the continue effort strengthen imf surveillance play also crucial role respect. it clear crisis prevention must remain key area efforts. crisis costly country concern also international system. give increase economic financial importance emerge markets, major event country bind spill-over effect rest world. let underpin argument figures: in last four years, major emerge market contribute half global real gdp growth (in ppp terms), account roughly 30% world export receive 20% global fdi. turn crisis management, important lesson learnt. there grow recognition predictability require side official sector order set right incentive actor involved. moral hazard concern limit availability official fund also lead increase discussion appropriate involvement private sector crisis management. of course, every single crisis different hence case need find appropriate balance triangle domestic adjustment, private sector involvement official support. therefore, crisis management practice still struggle inherent tension rule clarity one hand discretion flexibility other. however, considerable progress achieved. first, specific criterion procedure set last year make exceptional access fund resource subject rule hence predictable. we europe much favour set clear rule clear limit fund finance view large finance package provide country 1990s. the imf’s debt sustainability analysis play important role context, since clear limit official finance must respect especially country face unsustainable debt burden hence require debt restructuring. all imf shareholder need stick rules, least order provide right signal market avoid impression official sector suffer time inconsistency approval policy principle actual implementation. second, follow mexico’s bond issue collective action clause (cacs) february 2003, several emerge market include cacs bond issue new york law. more 70% new bond issue since early 2004 include cacs. a probably know, discernible impact borrow cost could detected. in order help make cacs standard feature sovereign bond contracts, eu member state commit include cacs issue new bond foreign jurisdiction. all progress remarkable, especially compare rather sceptical stance many country many private sector representative take 4 bi review 37/2004 past vis-à-vis recommendation rey report mexican crises. of course, far clause test practice take time cacs include entire stock debt. finally, work proceed so-called code good conduct, i suggest imf annual meet september 2002. such code would define best practice guideline behaviour debtor country creditor regard information-sharing, dialogue close co-operation time financial distress. while imf g7 encourage work g20 closely follow process, present official sector confine catalyse role leaf floor true stakeholder process, i.e. emerge market issuer private sector representatives. i understand currently intensive discussion take place main element code. i would like encourage party active constructive possible work could significant new tool prevent help solve potential crises. close remark we unique chance live world full opportunities, inspire complex, reward demanding, full chance risks. we witness two incredible transformation global economy last twenty five years. the technological surge permit compute transfer information practically cost. the globalisation process aim connect economy finance world within market-economy base framework. so goods, services, capital, technologies, concepts, idea move rapidly even instantaneously globe, expand considerably, quality quantity, domain ricardian comparative advantage. the significant surge labour productivity number industrialise economies, take india, china large number emerge countries, rapid race global growth. these great success today’s economic world global finance, mirror-image global economy, emblem powerful tool. but economic success without risks. we live permanently risky environment last twenty-five years. amongst many risks, might mention: debt crisis 1980s, start poland mexico spread latin america, africa, middle east soviet union; stock exchange fall 1987; mexican crisis 1994; bond market crash 1994; asian crisis start 1997; ltcm russian crisis 1998; recent stock exchange fall collapse technology bubble 2000. we surmount crisis episodes. we learn lot improve lot occasions. one friend use say: “good management come experience experience come bad management!” i think pretty experience i take thank lesson draw achieve level crisis prevention much better. but never forget risk still intimately associate structural transformation global economy. this not, respect, time complacency. if i sum today’s mottos, i would make follow five recommendations: • let u forget crucial role ifis, particular bretton wood institutions, management present global economy. the constant improvement management instrument key; • let u tirelessly improve transparency fields: best recipe avoid misallocation capital global crisis contagion; • let u continuously improve flexibility economy bold structural reforms. not improve efficiency also, more, improve resilience world shock expected; • let u reinforce methodology ensure amplify “pro-cyclical” phenomena: best envisage local sectoral level enemy good global systemic level. in respect informal group like g20 financial stability forum essence; • let u join effort improve scientific knowledge new world economy. still today, academic practitioner observer actor within environment largely uncharted territories. the profoundly understand function today’s global bi review 37/2004 5 economy, efficient weather stocks, prevent crisis, pave way continental global job creation, steady growth overall stability. 6 bi review 37/2004 alan greenspan: nomination hear testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system committee banking, housing, urban affairs, u senate, washington dc, 15 june 2004. * * * i want express gratitude president bush confidence you, mr. chairman member committee, expeditiously hold hear renomination fifth term chairman board governor federal reserve system. the federal reserve close productive relationship committee years. if senate colleague afford opportunity, i look forward work advance share goal strengthen firm foundation upon american people build prosperous economy sound efficient financial system. the performance u.s. economy impressive recent year face stagger shock year past would almost surely destabilizing. economic policy direct increase market flexibility play major role solid performance. those policies, aid major technological advances, foster globalization, unleash powerful new force competition, acceleration productivity, least time hold cost pressures. we federal reserve gradually come recognize structural change accordingly alter understand key parameter economic system policy stance. but live them, much uncertainty evolve structure economy influence monetary policy. the federal reserve’s experience past two decade make clear uncertainty pervasive feature monetary policy landscape; define characteristic landscape. a consequence, conduct monetary policy unite state come involve, core, crucial element risk management. this conceptual framework emphasize understand many source risk uncertainty policymakers face, quantify risk possible, assess cost associate risks. this framework entail devising, light risks, strategy policy direct maximize probability achieve time goal price stability maximum sustainable economic growth associate it. in design strategy meet policy objectives, draw work analysts, inside outside fed, past half century devote much effort improve understand economy monetary transmission mechanism. a critical result identification key relationship that, take together, provide useful approximation economy's dynamics. such approximation underlie statistical model federal reserve employ ass likely influence policy decisions. however, despite extensive effort capture quantify perceive key macroeconomic relationships, knowledge many important linkage far complete and, likelihood, always remain so. every economic model, matter detail well designed, conceptually empirically, vastly simplify representation world experience intricacy day-to-day basis. policymakers need reach beyond model broad - though le mathematically precise - hypothesis world works. a central bank need consider likely future path economy also distribution possible outcome around path. the decisionmakers need reach judgment probabilities, costs, benefit various possible outcome alternative choice policy. a transcript federal open market committee meet attest, face abundant challenges, find make monetary policy especially humble activity. in hindsight, path inflation, real output, employment, productivity, stock prices, exchange rate may seem preordained, insight exist experience development time. bi review 37/2004 1 yet, past quarter-century, policymakers manage defuse dangerous inflationary force deal consequence stock market crash, large asset price bubble, series liquidity crises. these development divert u pursuit eventual achievement price stability great economic stability go it. go forward, must remain prepare deal wide

recover, though remnant effect remain. we federal reserve learn good deal tragic episode respect impact policy and, le importance, function stress sophisticate payment system support economy. our effort bolster operational effectiveness federal reserve strength financial infrastructure continue today. each generation policymakers grapple change portfolio problems. so importantly draw experience predecessors, sure confront different problem future. the federal reserve fortunate work particularly favorable structural political environment past quarter-century. but trust monetary

37/2004 catherine kumar: set agenda hemispheric progress - development caribbean region presentation m catherine kumar, inspector financial institutions, central bank trinidad tobago, vii annual assembly assocation supervisor bank america (asba), atlanta, 2-5 june 2004. * * * introduction good morning lady gentlemen, let first thank asba kind invitation address behalf caribbean region important conference. it indeed pleasure first meet asba group since i recently join prestigious group regulators. a i prepare present issue challenge currently face u caribbean region, i would like first update important supervisory change occur trinidad tobago last days. a many aware, government work assiduously central bank trinidad tobago assume role supervisor regulator insurance industry register pension plans. this become reality amendment current insurance act enact may 25th, 2004. the challenge result amendment would imagine many i look forward support. the insurance industry expand border within region without proper supervision regulation. it central bank’s mandate correct urgency. lady gentlemen, supervisory body region face many challenge result globalization. the cgbs therefore choose theme “towards effective regional financial sector supervision within globalize context” year’s conference deal issues. the presentation think provoke case solutions/recommendations offered, cgbs seriously consider implement consider necessary. let thank jamaica deputy governor audrey anderson leadership caribbean group bank supervisors. it possible discus today issue raise conference i would like focus two major area supervisory response. these (1) imminent establishment caricom single market economy (csme) and, (2) ongoing challenge consolidate supervision. i conclude address update development trinidad tobago. the csme there doubt meet today take place time global growth prospect strengthening, unfortunately happen significant downside risk massive payment imbalance impend transition high interest rate environment. in fact, ramification globalization clear analyze effect many small vulnerable economy likely hike interest rate unite state generally shift global interest rate environment. the continue volatility world petroleum price also another factor impact economies. we therefore agree global liberalization trade finance well establish accept turn back u region. it background caribbean rapidly forge ahead towards goal single market economy (csme) december 2004. caricom member state agree remove restriction capital mobility, establishment business movement prescribe skill among countries. a ambassador narace head trinidad tobago csme unit say recently: “if succeed new hemispheric arrangement offer free trade america would important caribbean develop strong caribbean brand csme exactly provide environment would create that”. the caricom secretariat already produce caribbean single market economy bill cgbs receive bi review 36/2004 1 information work begin caricom secretariat model caribbean bank statute. in fact, member ask submit comment document recently circulated. some immediate obvious concern cgbs bill include:- • reconciliation csme provision international supervision standard requirements, example, need differential credit rat security originate member state base international capital adequacy standards; • difficulty harmonization different legislative framework dismantle entry barriers; • role status mous new propose arrangements. some issue discuss length recent cgbs conference paper present representative barbados respect harmonization regional legislative regulation framework within context globalization, copy available request. i share joke i find meaningful. “a group executive get together high-powered meeting. at round table discussion put cell phone down; know cannot go anywhere without become part us. there much heat discussion juggle paper back forth. sometime after, cell phone ring executive answered: (cid:190) “hello”. (cid:190) “hi sweetheart. i glad i get you. the real estate agent come around say let u house $5 million. i know bite expensive i really love house. can i please commit?” (cid:190) “sure darling, nothing expensive. you commit $5 million. (cid:190) “and know luxury boat saw - i think would romantic, sail islands. oh i would love it. it cost $2 million.” (cid:190) “alright gift you. $2 million fine. you great love.” (cid:190) “and course i want sport 5 carat ring finger go i hold hand. i see lady admire us. the jeweler say make special offer $1 million it. can i tell yes?” (cid:190) “my sweetheart sure can, take $1 million ring. bye.” at end conversation, much surprise others ease make major decision without proper study analyses, executive said: “excuse gentlemen, whose cell phone this?” the moral joke - cgbs work commentary, ensure caricom secretariat make quick decision behalf could long consequential impact effective supervision. i wish emphasize however cgbs support arrangement result strengthen region’s legislation supervisory framework must ensure proper measure place manage transition respect csme, address concern jurisdictional independence. colleagues, effect globalization force u come together region try buff small economy downside effects. the csme one way perfect need combine effort include latin american colleague make work. at recent seminar barbados, (the advocate may 22, 2004) governor central bank barbados indicate need formation credit rat agency region assistance investor time train conduct credit analyses. she time discuss regional capital market development fact must credit culture investor general able accurately evaluate risk return determine investment finance trends, base result derive evaluation 2 bi review 36/2004 exercises. i please inform caribbean community finally establish rat agency, caribbean information & credit rat agency limited. the agency capital base three million dollar world’s first regional credit rat agency offer rat product 19 countries. crisil limited, india’s lead ratings, financial news, risk policy advisory company, provide technical assistance acquire 9% stake agency manage director ceo board rat agency. crisil continue provide assistance agency ensure stability operations. this establishment regional credit rat agency indeed positive step towards regional approach critical issues. the agency commence operation october 2004. a region continue move csme must also prepare increase competition especially area job marketplace become unified. it important professional resource must become multi-tasked multi-disciplined order flexible enough adapt new challenges. this area member state must able manage efficiently cooperation. i turn issue consolidate supervision the concept consolidate supervision around while. the basel committee bank supervision promote concept develop series best practice bank supervisor include core principle effective bank supervision (1997) become world standard effective bank supervision. those country region experience fsaps multilateral agency imf world bank, would know importance adhere core principles. furthermore, imminent introduction new capital accord (basel ii) renew focus area assumption basel ii methodology consolidate supervision practised. the implication forego term supervisory oversight serious bank organization region continue expansionary mode external home environment. to quote asba’s plan document - “the bank industry continue evolve, lead great concentration, complexity, technological advancement cross-functional integration within industry across bank non-bank operations.” when couple development new market new product technological innovations, possibility supervisory arbitrage blur line financial products, must admit supervisor plate full possibly overflowing. more emphasis must therefore place fundamental element risk management practice financial non-financial firm challenge task supervise financial conglomerate cross-border operations, critical element consolidate supervision. the cgbs recognize challenge ahead seek build sturdy foundation already place explore fresh approach meet need members, foster enhance collaboration within group integrate supervisory practice response emerge issue regional international landscape. this include following:- • the need accurate timely data information inform development enhancement financial legislation facilitate practice consolidate supervision. • a refinement supervisory approach address evolution regional financial markets, e.g., growth cross border establishments, e-banking developments. • train staff different skill level differ skill set good supervise rapidly evolve institution regional markets. • technical assistance practical application new and/or emerge international supervisory standard supervisory frameworks, e.g., anti-money launder measures, basel ii. in addition, technical work group cgbs part mandate participation 9 member country formulate regional response basel committee respect third consultative paper (cp3) issue basel committee. a copy forward asba. this response together response individual jurisdiction find bi website. bi review 36/2004 3 the work group develop template quantitative impact study (qis) use member state ass potential impact basel ii supervise institutions. in trinidad tobago, begin process one large institution receive full cooperation acquire relevant information. at time, i would like acknowledge role bank jamaica provide resource infrastructure without work group would able meet mandate. we therefore congratulate sub-committee progress make region sincerely thank bank jamaica efforts. there doubt consolidate supervision attendant impact ability region adhere new accord indeed challenge. in meantime institution continue become complex raise issue potential contagion effective management systemic liquidity risks. the need specialist supervision department deal emerge complexity financial modeling, matter must address region. a i conclude address, i would like leave update development currently take place trinidad tobago certainly impact region whole. the financial sector trinidad tobago consider robust experience uninterrupted period positive economic growth last decade due primarily increase activity energy sector. however, element caution express private public sector time put place update regulatory preventative measure ensure potential risk exposure financial system significantly minimized. it clear government adopt proactive approach ensure repeat take place 1980’s experience collapse several financial institution trinidad tobago. a result foregoing, legislative reform critical aspect white paper develop ensure trinidad tobago attain first world status 2020. a i mention previously, central bank assume role regulator insurance industry. the vision single regulator. in interim regulatory council establish provide cooperation amongst various regulators. whilst legislative reform critical address complexity financial sector, aspect strengthen corporate governance, promote market discipline transparency critical. it mind central bank trinidad tobago develop several guideline include corporate governance fit proper assessment bank insurance companies. finally, i would like say globalization affect u live hemispheric region i sure latin american supervisory colleague present today experience similar situation i express today. we therefore need work together share experience knowledge conference one ensure critical issue address maintenance safety soundness financial systems. once again, i thank allow opportunity share supervisory issue face caribbean group set agenda hemispheric progress. 4 bi review 36/2004 toshiro muto: what lie beyond cyclical recovery? speech mr toshiro muto, deputy governor bank japan, japan society, london, 7 june 2004. * * * good afternoon, lady gentlemen. today, touch short-term outlook japanese economy, i talk challenge japan faces. i. short-term outlook japanese economy the outlook japanese economy reasonably good foreseeable future. a see chart 1, economic growth, show 3.2% fiscal 2003, 3.1% fiscal 2004 accord median forecast bank japan’s policy board end april. the ongoing economic recovery third kind since burst bubble early 1990s. during so-called “lost decade,” two economic recoveries: one 3.6% growth fiscal 1996, 3.0% growth fiscal 2000. the first recovery immediately follow sharp slowdown second negative growth. compare two cases, chance good recovery sustained. behind three factors. the first factor encourage outlook world economy spite risk associate persistently high oil prices. many economist believe unite state grow fast pace potential growth rate. while economic growth china expect decelerate somewhat overheat pace, still likely fairly rapid. the second factor great demand digital consumer electronics home abroad. this provide favorable business condition japanese manufacturers, whose competitive edge lie high-end electronic device include flat-screen panels. this important reason recovery business fix investment. the bank’s corporate survey tankan show nominal capital spend large manufacturer increase 7% fiscal 2004 9% increase fiscal 2003. third important factor behind good economic outlook progress structural adjustments. chart 2 illustrate ratio corporate debt cash flow decline steadily. the improvement observe even small medium-sized nonmanufacturing firms, sector particularly heavy debt burden. a adjustment labor, chart 3 show share labor cost nominal gdp decline low level since early 1990s. in connection structural adjustments, chart 4 shows, progress also make reduce nonperforming loans. a far major bank concerned, whole seem hit march 2005 target, namely, low share nonperforming loan total credit half march 2002. of course, japan’s financial institution still face quite problems. in regard, step effort reduce

arising. in order turn nascent opportunity full-scale revitalization economy, private sector government work harder. ii. conduct monetary policy on part bank japan, continue maintain monetary condition help deflation come end. chart 5 show deflation ease year-on-year change consumer price index (cpi) yet reach positive territory even help upward one-off factor include rise rice prices. base assessment underlie trend cpi still moderately negative, bank conduct extremely accommodative policy three features. bi review 36/2004 1 first, bank provide unusually ample liquidity financial markets. the so-called “quantitative monetary easing” keep short-term interest rate almost zero, thereby ensure stability financial markets, turn support economic activity. second, bank conduct policy commitment continue quantitative ease deflation ends. the resultant “policy duration effect,” work expectation future monetary policy, contribute stabilize financial markets. third, bank make effort enhance transmission mechanism monetary easing. for instance, bank already expand type money market operations. moreover, bank eagerly communicate market participant authority expand securitization market. of three feature current monetary policy, let elaborate second one: bank’s policy commitment. in commitment, bank maintain quantitative ease core cpi register stably zero percent increase year-on-year. more specifically, bank consider terminate quantitative easing, certain condition must met: core cpi inflation positive month forecast remain positive future. a inflation forecast, semiannual outlook report end april show board members’ median outlook core cpi fiscal 2004 –0.2%. although narrow output gap lag effect rise commodity price contribute moderate cpi deflation, strong enough make year-on-year cpi firmly positive fiscal 2004. i believe sustain reform private government sectors, together bank’s commitment keep monetary easing, help economy gather momentum, turn lead good possibility deflation come end. iii. longer-term issue japanese economy despite encourage short-term outlook, age decline population source concern economic growth long run. any attempt address concern would cause conflict interest regard income transfer risk sharing. how deal type conflict particularly daunt challenge. challenge arise population age let explain serious demographic change japan. a show chart 6, japan’s population expect start decline 2007. moreover, share elderly people 65 old increase since around 1990 approach 20%. in 2050, share expect reach 36%, second high world spain. not share among highest, rise pace share unparalleled. there calculation unite nation many year take elderly people’s share country double 10% 20%: 42 year spain, 70 year germany, 75 year unite kingdom, 21 year japan. the rapid population age certainly significant impact economy. first, labor force decrease. accord bank’s research staff, assume labor participation rate give age stay constant, decline labor force cause demographic change pull economic growth rate 0.5% 2010s. the second impact population age save rate. chart 7 illustrate household save rate japan already decline line population aging. it decline 15% early 1990s merely 6.4% 2002. assume decline save rate restrain capital formation, bank’s research staff estimate economic growth rate 2010s would reduce 0.5%. together another 0.5% decline come labor factor i mentioned, economic growth rate overall decline much 1%. the third problem cause population age increase doubt sustainability pension system. chart 8 show japanese birthrate steadily declining, recent figure low 1.32. if continue next hundred years, rough estimate suggest japan’s population become one-third current population. while much high birthrate require maintain current pension system, raise birthrate short 2 bi review 36/2004 period time realistic. therefore, imminent need massive pension reform, notwithstanding difficulty allocate huge loss carry past system. inevitable rise cost social safety net a population ages, pension benefit also demand medical service elderly care increase. however, young generation unsure whether increase demand met. accord survey conduct bank’s affiliate, central council financial service information, among household head 60, 19% “very worried” retirement 1995, share double 45% 2003. change social structure lifestyle may also source uncertainty future. traditionally, family member care age parent neighbor help other, businesses, so-called “lifetime employment system,” provide employee education, welfare, job security. however, lifestyle change company involve increasingly fierce global competition, traditional safety net become le dependable. this put public sector position play great role provide social safety nets. a national burden, appear room enhance safety nets. chart 9 show “national burden,” define sum tax social security contributions, currently stand 36% national income. the ratio much small european countries. if use “potential national burden,” include fiscal deficit, conclusion still holds. although suggest shoulder somewhat heavy burden somewhat good safety net reasonable option japan, question much remains. all all, easy achieve national consensus much high benefit burden appropriate. it may take time japanese people make choice. iv. to second stage structural reform the bad scenario japan fall “heavy burden insufficient benefit” society, might actually take place without gain productivity. it exactly context structural reform propel further. among many reform agenda, i focus importance facilitate integration japan global economy. further integration global economy although home resource constrain decline population, great source usable technology, labor, management skill abroad. i believe determine nation’s long-term economic growth population flexibility take advantage globally available resources. let discus two aspect globalization: use foreign management resource use foreign labor force. the first aspect introduce foreign management resources. a chart 10 shows, although foreign direct investment japan increase considerably, stock direct inward investment ratio nominal gdp still much low ratio countries. one good example unite kingdom 1980s. tax incentives, infrastructure improvements, measure take promote foreign inward investment. japanese manufacturers, encourage u.k. government, decide build factory here; nissan early good example many others, particularly automobile company electrical appliance companies, follow suit. the core reform unite kingdom perhaps willingness open world. many year late late 1990s, nissan become model, time, demonstrate merit learn foreign management. mr. carlos ghosn come nissan new president, transform company crisis one year record performance. the revival nissan, create competitive environment, contribute invigorate entire automobile industry trigger large-scale restructure suppliers. the second aspect global integration extensive use foreign labor. some people express concern introduction foreign worker rapid, unbearable friction arise, bi review 36/2004 3 particularly homogeneous country like japan. however, certain area economy, example service industry, growth potential hinge availability labor force. there must balance expand foreign employment, directly outsourcing, avoid excessive socioeconomic changes. after all, many country get active global allocation resources, japan compete them. under circumstances, key economic prosperity lie continuous trial error process combine globally available technology, management, human resource merit economy own. conclude remark a i discussed, japan’s economy still face many challenges, particularly long run. on hand, prospect continue economic recovery good least time being. the bank japan, part, continue make every effort bring deflation end, thereby create good environment progress structural reforms. thank listening. 4 bi review 36/2004 svein gjedrem: inflation target - theory main focus practice speech mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank

abnormally low. however, prevail view monetary policy time probably interest. brofoss say following: “increasing discount rate probably widely regard important monetary policy measure. the interest rate is, however, controversial instrument, norway countries. nonetheless, increase number country use it. whether purport good result ascribe solely interest rate policy another question. the effect norway may differ somewhat effect countries. country major currency influence short-term capital movement via interest rate. this possible limit extent norway. a substantial share business investment

implementation basel ii - indian perspective address m kishori j udeshi, deputy governor reserve bank india, world bank/imf/us federal reserve board 4th annual international seminar policy challenge financial sector: basel ii, washington dc, 2 june 2004. * * * yesterday absorb discussion macro issues, regulatory perspective risk management challenge relate basel ii. we debate whether go forward basel ii implement basel ii. in fact, understand basel ii concept one step away agree principle. implement basel ii another long step away understand it. let briefly detail implementation issue specific reference india. feature indian financial system a feature, somewhat unique indian financial system diversity composition. we dominance government ownership couple significant private shareholding public sector bank turn continue dominant share total bank system. these public sector bank list stock exchange performance reflect p/e ratios. the private sector bank especially new one world class. we also cooperative banks, whose number large pose challenge multiplicity regulatory supervisory authorities. there also regional rural bank link parent commercial banks. foreign bank branch operate profitably india large regulatory standard bank uniform. the process provide financial service change rapidly traditional bank one stop shop vary financial service old institutional demarcation get increasingly blurred. approach prudential norms: review the reserve bank’s approach institution prudential norm one gradual convergence international standard best practice suitable country specific adaptations. our aim reach global best standard deliberately phase manner consultative process evolve within country. this also guide principle approach new basel accord e.g. minimum capital adequacy requirement basel standard 8% india, stipulate achieve minimum capital 9%. on hand, bank india still process implement capital charge market risk prescribe basel document although since 1998 place several surrogate investment fluctuation reserve 5% investment portfolio, afs hft category plus 2.5% risk weight entire investment portfolio - whereas basel norm take account trade portfolio. rbi’s involvement basel ii rbi’s association basel committee bank supervision date back 1997 india among 16 non-member country consult draft basel core principles. reserve bank india become member core principle liaison group 1998 subsequently become member core principle work group capital. within cpwg, rbi actively participate deliberation accord privilege lead group 6 major non g - 10 supervisor present proposal simplify approach basel ii committee. the basel committee bank supervision yet issue final basel ii document. the reserve bank’s comment 3rd consultative document new capital accord basis quantitative impact study (qis 3) undertake co-ordination select bank bring need simplicity great flexibility account different level preparedness bank system india. bi review 35/2004 1 policy approach in general, keep view rbi’s goal consistency harmony international standard approach adopt pace may appropriate context country specific needs, rbi april 2003 accept principle adopt new capital accord basel ii. the rbi announced, annual policy statement may 2004 bank india examine depth option available basel ii draw road-map end december 2004 migration basel ii review progress make thereof quarterly intervals. the reserve bank closely monitor progress make bank direction. hence, minimum bank india, begin with, adopt standardize approach credit risk basic indicator approach operational risk. after adequate skill developed, bank supervisory levels, bank may allow migrate irb approach. regulatory initiative the regulatory initiative take reserve bank india include: • ensure bank suitable risk management framework orient towards requirement dictate size complexity business, risk philosophy, market perception expect level capital. the framework adopt bank would need adaptable change business size, market dynamic introduction innovative product bank future. • introduction risk base supervision (rbs) 23 bank pilot basis. • encourage bank formalize capital adequacy assessment programme (caap) alignment business plan performance budget system. this, together adoption risk base supervision would aid factor pillar ii requirement basel ii. • enhance area disclosure (pillar iii), great transparency financial position risk profile banks. • improve level corporate governance standard banks. • build capacity ensure regulator’s ability identify permit eligible bank adopt irb / advance measurement approaches. challenge envisage against background complexity involve also area “constructive ambiguity” concept application envisage follow regulatory supervisory challenge ahead: • india three establish rat agency lead international credit rat agency stakeholder also extend technical support. however, level rat penetration significant as, far, rat restrict issue issuers. while basel ii give scope extend rat issue issuers, would approximation would necessary system move rat issuers. encourage rat issuer would challenge. • basel ii provide scope supervisor prescribe high minimum capital level bank for, among others, interest rate risk bank book concentration risk / risk exposures. a already stated, india initiate supervisory capacity build identify slackness ass / quantify extent additional capital may require maintain banks. the magnitude task complete december 2006, india many 100 banks, daunting. • cross border issue deal basel committee bank supervision recently. but, india, foreign bank statutorily require maintain local capital follow issue would therefore, require resolve u : – whether internal model approve head office home country supervisor adopt indian branch foreign bank need validate 2 bi review 35/2004 reserve bank whether validation home country supervisor would consider adequate? – whether data history maintain use bank distinct indian branch compare global data maintain use head office? – whether capital operational risk maintain separately indian branch india whether may maintain abroad head office? – whether bank mandate maintain capital per sa / bia approach india irrespective approach adopt head office? • basel ii could actually imply minimum requirement could become pro-cyclical. no doubt prudent risk management policy pillar ii iii would help overall stability. we feel would preferable consistent prudential norm good bad time rather calibrate prudential norm counter pro-cyclicality. • the existence large complex financial conglomerate could potentially pose systemic risk would necessary put place supervisory policy address this. • in event bank adopt irb approach, bank adopt standardise approach, follow profile may emerge: – bank adopt irb approach much risk sensitive bank standardise approach, since even small change degree risk might translate large impact additional capital requirement irb banks. hence irb bank could avoid assume high risk exposures. since bank adopt standardise approach equally risk sensitive since relative capital requirement would le exposure, bank standardise approach could incline assume exposure high risk clients, finance irb banks. a result, high risk asset could flow towards bank standardise approach need maintain low capital asset bank irb approach.similarly, low risk asset would tend get concentrate irb bank need maintain low capital asset standardise approach banks. – hence, system whole may maintain low capital warranted. – due concentration high risks, standardise approach bank become vulnerable time economic downturns. these issue would need address satisfactorily. conclusion in conclusion, i would say keep view cost compliance bank supervisors, regulatory challenge would migrate basel ii non-disruptive manner. we would like continue process interaction country learn experience various international fora. i may mention india one early country subject voluntarily fsap imf system assess high compliance relevant principles. with gradual purposeful implementation bank sector reform past decade, indian bank system show significant improvement various parameters, become robust display ample resilience shock economy. there therefore, ample evidence capacity indian bank system migrate smoothly basel ii. bi review 35/2004 3 i j macfarlane: recent financial economic development australia open statement mr i j macfarlane, governor reserve bank australia, house representative stand committee economics, finance public administration, sydney, 4 june 2004. * * * it pleasure front committee again. a usual, i start review forecast i give committee six month ago brisbane, provide update current forecasts. i move discuss risk forecasts, upward downward direction. last december think gdp growth calendar 2003 would 3½ per cent. we know come 3.9 per cent, second half year lot strong first half, growth slip 3.2 per cent four quarter march 2004. our forecast growth calendar 2004 3¾ per cent. we begin low forecast weaker-than-expected export retail trade strong imports. we raise forecast follow budget, low take board march quarter national account release two day ago. i must say, however, i think market over-reacted march quarter gdp figure. it low forecast mechanical sense one four quarter low previous forecast. it materially change view trajectory rest year, anything raise it. on inflation, forecast 2¼ per cent cpi increase calendar 2003 come bite high 2.4 per cent, since recede 2 per cent four quarter march 2004. for calendar 2004, headline inflation heavily influence movement oil prices, best look underlie inflation. we still forecast underlie measure run 2 per cent, last time met. by end 2005, headline underlie measure likely move 2½ per cent. so still shallow saucer-shaped profile underlie inflation next year. give recent rise petrol prices, headline increase likely high underlie short run. this pretty good outlook growth inflation, absolute term and, particularly, relative thing might turn out. i would like illustrate latter point refer back framework i put committee year ago meet melbourne. this contain four possible scenarios, i recap. the first was: “a weaken world outlook abate domestic credit asset market pressures. this would provide reasonably clear prognosis monetary policy. in words, weak internationally, weak domestically, would easy. in direction, would combination clear strengthen world economy continue domestic buoyancy. that would easy. a third possible combination, favourable one australia, would firm world economy ease domestic pressures, result balance growth australian economy. but combination would damage australian economy would household sector continue put expose position rate past year while, time, weaken world economy start fee australian activity incomes.” the last-mentioned possible outcomes, unfavourable, distinct possibility middle last year, fortunately come pass. what occur instead second half last year second-mentioned possibility - strengthen world economy continuation domestic credit asset market pressure centre housing. this environment decide twice raise cash rate. what happen far year - although take time clearly identify - third-mentioned possibility - transition set condition line firm world economy ease domestic pressures. this favourable outcome one likely result balance growth australian economy. i outline speech i bi review 35/2004 1 give macquarie university april spell fully quarterly statement monetary policy publish last month. the fact condition begin develop along line also reason why, two rate rise late 2003, see need action monetary policy board meet year. in short, comfortable development - lot last year. but, always, risk outlook, i spend rest presentation discuss them. on external side, consensus forecast growth world economy 2004 put well 4 per cent, similar figure 2005. certainly, bulk economic data support relatively optimistic outlook. we third year international expansion, unless something unforeseen come along, expect expansion last good year longer. this impression would get follow press report financial market developments, downside risk outlook always seem easy identify upside ones. the risk rise oil price constant concern, substance apprehensions, i say subject present mr stevens already deliver piece cover couple day ago. a number others market worry policy tighten china overdone, lead collapse chinese economy. i confidence china that, welcome news chinese authority take step rein excessive investment. more generally, financial market difficulty come grip fact long period low world interest rate must come end, adjust international environment rise world interest rate next years. overall, think concern overdo comfortable work assumption consensus forecast good world recovery reasonable one. we also note high oil price high interest rate symptom global strength, global weakness. we also rule risk upside. it may turn case low world interest rate keep place long period. in case, could see great inflationary pressure currently expect. in scenario, i believe main result would fast rise world interest rates, market react prospect, reality central bank act keep inflation control. turn australian economy, i want start re-emphasise monetary policy determine development economy whole, development one component. for example, much 2002/03, domestic demand increase exceptionally strong pace, external sector subtract growth. inflation time also 3 per cent. even so, use monetary policy rein rapid growth domestic demand because, economy whole, growth excessive threaten inflation objective medium term, despite short run. while monetary policy direct economy whole, mean direct equal amount attention components. those part obviously exhibit serious imbalance attract attention relatively well behaved. this explain spend much time talk about, researching, excessively rapid growth house credit and, recently, house prices. while economic variable important overall macro-economic outlook, example consumption wage growth, behaviour clearly aberrant therefore need intensive study. the forecast gdp growth 2004 i present base view domestic demand slow former rapid pace, time subtraction growth due external sector gradually diminish. consumption recently slow bit, although continue support strong employment growth benefit tax cut late year. business fix investment, particularly build structures, add growth extent recent years. residential investment expect subtract growth government spend add it. overall, expect gdp growth 3¾ per cent would good outcome. at stage, assume significant drought effect come twelve months, remain downward risk, give dry condition prevail part country far year. on inflation front, see problem next twelve months. beyond that, picture necessity difficult quantify. last time meet slightly trouble fact 2 bi review 35/2004 inflation non-traded sector 4 per cent, continue might imply medium-term outlook inflation somewhat 3 per cent. this still risk, take comfort fact sector push - house-building property service - slow pressure come house-building sector. the continue modest growth average wage date also give u confidence. to extent upward risk inflation medium term, likely come international development world recovery gather momentum. i conclude say word house credit house prices. a say quarterly statement monetary policy, “the run-up credit growth associate boom house price recent year present two implication economy: tend boost growth short term, carry risk damage correction continue long.” in fact, represent one internal imbalance could put risk continuation long economic expansion beneficial australian community. it surprising, therefore, experience feel relief data start emerge year suggest bad excess may past. first, saw three monthly reduction loan approval start november 2003 amount cumulative fall 20 per cent. approval run $12 billion per month instead $15 billion peak last year. it still far early know whether lend return sustainable pace - certainly $12 billion per month still far high - least progress made. certainly, prospect return sustainable rate growth credit seem bright several years, increase likelihood run good economic outcome last decade continue. more recently, receive strong evidence house price slow rate increase, fall level term far year. this occur state capital cities, include two largest, australia average, house apartments. a fall price become widely known, allow potential house purchaser take time afraid, many were, rush buy fear miss last opportunity. it enable resist blandishment banks, broke commission agent ply offer seemingly generous quantity credit. it also reinforce recent tendency investor question assumption easy capital gains. a such, expect house market continue go much-needed cool phase time yet. that i wish say economy stage, i happy answer question wish put me. i also conscious i talk economy quite leave time cover various area bank’s responsibilities, contribute soundness financial system, ensure efficiency payment system issue australia’s currency. but i sure cover question answer session. bi review 35/2004 3 jean-pierre roth: the creation euro new international monetary order - view switzerland speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, 2nd conference “geld und währung” foundation financial stability globalisation, frankfurt, 3-4 june, 2004. * * * 1. introduction it widely acknowledge birth euro january 1, 1999 milestone process european integration. give national sovereignty monetary matter bold move truly historical proportions. it long-lasting economic political consequences. it promote efficiency, transparency, growth. the creation single currency also act catalyst towards european integration. moreover, really i would like focus today, creation euro change world’s monetary landscape. i believe one say without fear exaggeration lead new international monetary order. and it, good news indeed. 2. our pre-euro fear to honest, i must admit prior introduction euro somewhat worry swiss national bank. although fully appreciate benefit switzerland would draw creation euro term increase transparency low transaction costs, also quite concern possible risks. we three main fears. first, concern swiss franc might roller-coaster ride. in past, whenever dollar attack, international investor turn attention german mark swiss franc. their status safe-haven currency mean time turbulence foreign exchange market would move well beyond economic fundamental could justify. in fact, swiss franc often exhibit tendency appreciate even german mark, phenomenon often attribute relative narrowness swiss financial markets. now german mark gone, wouldn’t attention focus swiss franc? would mean dollar crisis franc would bear even adjustment past? even worse, would happen euro attack? the last thing need franc become first currency line fire, something like lighten rod international monetary system. a second fear would become difficult future conduct independent monetary policy. switzerland, together liechtenstein, would totally surround single monetary zone. a know, switzerland small open economy, i emphasize word small open. indeed, widely open. nearly half national income generate abroad, european union far large foreign partner. about two third export head direction, one best customer eu. we also small, mean although significant impact rest europe, expose foreign shocks, whether real monetary nature. our activity highly correlate eurozone. under conditions, would snb still position conduct independent monetary policy? would realistic expect snb follow course deviate one set european central bank, would snb oblige shadow action ecb? the question independent monetary policy matter safeguard interest prestige job swiss central bankers. the stake much higher. for one thing, even swiss activity economic condition generally highly correlate europe, correlation perfect. our economy, although offer many similarity german french economies, also specificities. thus, switzerland well supply physical human capital. a consequence, return capital relatively low wage relatively high, particularly unskilled workers. we thus tend specialize capital-intensive high-value-added activities. external shock tend impact u way exactly bi review 35/2004 1 rest europe. moreover, cope home-brewed shock well. it reason eager keep independent monetary policy. furthermore, market become convince future snb’s action would merely xerox copy ecb’s monetary policy, would rapidly force convergence nominal interest rate eurozone. our real interest rate might remain low while, give relatively large endowment physical capital, tendency towards equalization would nonetheless set in. what might mean u high inflation rate time, together collapse asset price domestic gross capital formation. a cocktail high interest rate high wage structure would highly detrimental competitiveness export markets. the third fear sometimes expressed, although i must say i rather sceptical myself, euro could eventually make swiss franc obsolete. with many trade firm bill pay supplier euros, might tendency adopt euro generally account well domestic transactions. some people even go far predict long wage would pay euros. shops, hotel restaurant would rapidly force accept euros, visitor abroad would long see need convert euro francs. eventually swiss consumer would follow suit, switzerland would de facto integrate eurozone. more national pride would hurt “euroization” swiss economy. for one thing, development would entail loss seigniorage income. with monetary base 40 billion franc (25 billion euros), 5,700 franc (3,500 euros) per person, seigniorage case far trivial. but much seriously, loss monetary autonomy cause displacement swiss franc euro would prevent central bank create liquidity case need. to large extent, fear reflect fundamental debate fix versus flexible exchange rates. which foreign exchange regime appropriate give country particular time? although view universally shared, many economist argue polar solution: either purely flexible exchange rates, rigidly fix ones. intellectually, i tend share view, except i would like take one step further: either purely flexible exchange rates, monetary union. rigidly fix exchange rate constitute polar case. in fact, accumulate many shortcomings. thus, fix exchange rate never know fix long. fix exchange rate fix day change, change, often brutally atmosphere crisis, pain, tears. no, i believe one really aim exchange rate irrevocably fixed, one move way, go monetary union. a long two currency distinguishable, relative price might change. so choice flexible exchange rate monetary union. needle say, since switzerland member european union, join eurozone option worth discuss stage. fix franc euro would even second best. it would rather bad world suppress monetary independence, and, time, expose u danger speculative attack set u up, back wall, alone market. 3. our post-euro experience what happen since january 1, 1999, all, prove reassuring. our bad fear materialized, indeed, ways, outcome even much favourable could hop for. first, let briefly sum experience regard fear “euroization” loss monetary degree freedom. a expected, swiss franc crowd euro. sure, euro circulate switzerland, like swiss franc circulate neighbour france germany, phenomenon remain marginal, exceed use french francs, german mark italian lira pre-euro world. this surprising, even though euro (and dollar matter) happily accept swiss shops, cafés, hotels, exchange rate usually unattractive change give swiss francs. shopkeeper restaurant owner business provide financial services, foreign tourist still good change euro bank use credit cards. true, swiss firm use euro extensively, much bill european currency, even switch account euros. some natural hedge take place well, although clear efficient is. it noteworthy, however, large firm much bill 2 bi review 35/2004 account dollars, others quite happily continue use swiss franc. the fact “euroization” take place really surprise us. there example small independent currency survive neighbourhood much large monetary zones. the example canadian dollar come mind. the loonie float past several decades, serve canada rather well. more generally, nothing gain one currency transaction purposes. much double coincidence want get lose several currency circulate simultaneously. “dollarization” occur country hyperinflation threatens. this happen switzerland, best record price stability europe! the fear lose monetary independence misplace well. over past five year snb demonstrate act decisively independently, often well ecb. give openness, switzerland badly affect world slowdown. the situation make bad fact main trade partner, germany, severely hit, compound difficulties, worldwide capital overhang adverse effect exporters, many specialize production capital goods. special circumstance require special action. from march 2001 april 2003, snb cut interest rate aggressively, low target range reference rate, three-month libor, 325 basis points, 3.5% 0.25%. if anything, differential swiss euro interest rate slightly widened, put fear rapid loss interest rate advantage rest. what stability external value swiss franc? here, i must say, fear prove unfounded, reality turn even favourable could hop for. the exchange rate swiss franc euro end much steady expected, fact even steady use german mark, mention french franc italian lira. over past five years, real exchange rate move within relatively narrow band little five percentage point wide. except post-september 11 period, swiss franc appreciate markedly, external value franc largely reflect economic fundamentals. in fact, even post-9/11 safe-haven effect relatively mild compare experience past, seventy eighties, instance. 4. a new international monetary order i believe one could make case introduction euro bring new international monetary order, produce element stability benefit many countries, europe’s immediate neighbours, nation around globe. a seen, movement dollar/mark exchange rate magnify far swiss franc concern past, much dampen today. when euro depreciate dollar, swiss franc too, much less degree. and later, euro appreciate dollar, franc appreciate well, less extent. in words, effective exchange rate le affected, movement dollar offset, least extent, movement euro opposite direction. it seem phenomenon benefit switzerland, also many country independent currencies, unite kingdom, canada, australia, new zealand, singapore, norway. this evolution might last. perhaps outcome chance, persistent enough past year noticeable. maybe one day smart graduate student write thesis topic, confirm falsify hypothesis, meantime let outline i believe good reason assumption stability international monetary system enhance creation euro. i think anybody would argue world whole make optimal currency area. our planet yet ready single currency. we therefore bind live world n, n great one, currencies. for second half 20th century, live one dominate currency, u.s. dollar, many le important currencies, british pound, japanese yen, german mark, swiss franc, on. moreover, unite state largely close economy, could regard fluctuation external value dollar benign neglect. of course, countries, rather small quite open, fully expose turbulence foreign exchange markets, much could it. there several episode internal stability dollar threaten well, u.s. inflation rate double digits. the flight stable currency put considerable pressure these. bi review 35/2004 3 today, arrival euro change landscape important respects. first, new kid block, euro command attention respect. in economic size, eurozone nearly rival unite states. there obvious alternative dollar instrument portfolio diversification. if investor doubt dollar, long need rush swiss franc, euro fine. second, eurozone, although quite extent unite states, largely close economy. movement euro far le devastate movement similar magnitude swiss franc german mark. the euro much capable currency take role shock absorber u.s. dollar. the eurozone, ways, large close economy world need counterweight u.s. economy. all small open economies, like switzerland, benefit new international monetary order. there third reason arrival euro change landscape fundamentally prove beneficial stability international monetary system, competition. even though u.s. monetary authority mandate specifically direct price stability ecb does, investor choice vote feet. thus pressure unite state deliver price stability well. i find unlikely experience time soon double digit inflation rate u.s., good news indeed good health international monetary system. 5. conclusion all all, introduction euro positive development international monetary system switzerland economy strongly dependent world trade. we benefit great transparency offer euro low transaction cost make possible creation. perhaps first time history, surround area share monetary policy objective do, namely price stability. this explain large extent swiss franc/euro exchange rate relatively stable past five years. but presence single european currency per se also shield third currency - like swiss franc - much volatility case dollar turbulences. at time, keep trump card independent monetary policy enable u respond rapidly specific need swiss economy. since 2001, thus low interest rate quickly decisively ecb. with inflation le 1 percent, enjoy price stability interest rate lie clearly correspond rate eurozone. a homogeneous monetary system europe stable international monetary order help switzerland fully benefit present recovery world economy. 4 bi review 35/2004 axel a weber: financial stability globalisation open address professor dr axel a weber, president deutsche bundesbank, second conference monetary stability foundation “financial stability globalisation”, frankfurt main, 3 june 2004. * * * it exceptional pleasure honour welcome second conference monetary stability foundation. i would like extend special welcome distinguish member diplomatic corp present afternoon, peter w bodde, u consul general frankfurt leonidas contovounesios, consul general hellenic republic frankfurt. it great pleasure able welcome governor central bank europe: jaime caruana, governor banco d’españa, ljubisa krgovic, governor central bank montenegro, dr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank. i exceptionally please able welcome professor helmut schlesinger, president deutsche bundesbank 1991 1993. i glad u today jürgen hettinger, president frankfurt regional office deutsche bundesbank. thank host conference. and, last least, i would like welcome distinguish speaker make conference inspire event: professor giancarlo corsetti, professor gerhard illing, professor philip lane, professor andrew k rose, professor karlhans sauernheimer, associate professor philip e strahan. lady gentlemen! i come office president deutsche bundesbank five week ago. i root academia, line work i participate frequently conference monetary issues, least various conference host institution i entrust with. therefore, introduction “it exceptional pleasure honour” mean literally. 1. the importance monetary stability the overarch purpose monetary stability foundation strengthen public awareness great importance monetary stability. this objective pursue mainly mean finance research monetary issues, thereby broaden intellectual foundation stability policy. in december 2002, monetary stability foundation hold first conference. since then, development - debate - underline important nonstop emphasis stability is. i would like briefly comment three issue stand respect. they also link stability foundation’s academic approach central bank practice. 1. over decades, inflation occasionally declare dead. the late event strand take place wake new economy. at time, widely hop globalisation new technology would put end inflation. the recession follow burst new economy bubble even bring serious debate whether deflation replace inflation main threat monetary stability. a world economy regain strength, perception reverse itself. in current environment substantial global economic growth, high energy price ample liquidity, focus shift back inflation. the hope end inflation materialise. 2. the second development underline importance monetary stability foundation observe institutional environment. the institutional framework monetary stability feature topic first conference monetary stability foundation. since then, institutional foundation euro area repeatedly face danger undermined. the european convention present draft eu bi review 35/2004 1 constitutional treaty might considerably weaken institutional framework single currency agree maastricht treaty. european monetary union characterise two key feature design guarantee monetary stability: primary objective maintain price stability central bank independence. the euro still young currency short - albeit encourage - track record. the sound institutional framework lend credibility euro. one objection present european central banker recently sustained: price stability remain one eu’s goals. i fully appreciate response repeat intervention. european central bankers’ remain key concern field constitutional treaty pertain independence national central banks, abridge procedure future change monetary framework, ecb list among “other european institutions”. politician must jeopardise foundation stable currency. this hold also true stability growth pact. this second pillar european monetary framework also come stress. government hesitate consolidate budget time plenty recently face headwind weak economy. however, regulation classify inadequate cause regulate party feel discomfort. the objective lay pact, namely achieve budgetary position least close balance medium term, important feature stable environment conducive economic growth. the debate change pact wrong debate. the pact fine. it enforcement, however, must improved. the third development, intensification international debate financial stability, also link first second conference monetary stability. in context institutional framework monetary stability, issue crisis prevention crisis resolution, transparency best organise prudential supervision already discuss forum. at year’s conference focus financial stability issue arise context globalisation. 2. globalisation financial stability globalisation entail considerable benefit world economy. they come form high standard live resident advance countries, also people le least develop countries, increasingly integrate world economy. the liberalisation international capital flow start early 1980s. since then, volume international financial transaction rise substantially rapidly. the opportunity international portfolio diversification risk reallocation broaden markedly. however, deregulation international capital flow seem come cost increase number international financial crises. in term output welfare loss tend costly. to gain, maintain - necessary - regain financial stability major challenge globalise world. in order properly design appropriate institutions, tool procedures, need understand globalisation impact financial stability. with conference, monetary stability foundation seek contribute understand financial stability context globalisation. 3. tour d’horizon conference the conference start stock-take exercise. the first panel provide empirical assessment far “international integration financial systems” advanced. the level composition gross net hold foreign asset liability surely good start point quantify state financial globalisation. their evolution time may provide useful help identify drive force behind growth international holdings. what behind look 2 bi review 35/2004 like widespread shift debt equity fdi instruments? what implication expect ensue change cross-border flow investment income? the quantitative picture web international financial linkage amplify late afternoon three contribution highlight “international contagion financial markets”. contagion become issue asian financial crisis. to define contagion trivial issue. do country suffer crisis economy fundamentally similar position? or economy infect despite sound fundamentals? how contagion happen? can country effectively “immunise” contagion? tomorrow’s session start panel “exchange rate regime worldwide stability”. exchange rate regime among main suspect create financial instability - domestic macroeconomic policy line choose exchange rate regime. in choose exchange rate regime, decide important: advantage afford flexibility domestic policy monetary policy credibility may gain external anchor. contrary widely hold bipolar view, intermediate exchange rate regime show durability. how choice exchange rate system contribute worldwide stability? a panel “internationalisation bank risk implications” attempt shed light impact banks’ international asset financial stability. it strive enquire net effect financial institutions’ international portfolio diversification financial stability. the stabilise effect international portfolio diversification contrast potentially destabilise effect result faulty risk assessment due information asymmetries. the fifth last panel conference explore financial stability issue “financial system emerge markets”. a regard invest financial institutions, question specific risk incur “setting shop” emerge markets. a regard emerge markets, internationalisation financial system deem bless curse. host country sometimes fear internationalisation bank systems, eg via foreign direct investment, entail volatility vulnerability. however, east european show internationalisation positive effect efficiency financial system economy general. 4. conclude remark this conference academic nature; majority speaker therefore come academia. thank contribute second conference monetary stability foundation. i glad bundesbank successful talk several distinguish policy maker speak conference. thank enhance theoretical approach view business policy making. i especially delight jean-claude trichet join u tonight speak conference dinner. a i approach end remarks, i would like thank professor hermann remsperger, chairman supervisory board monetary stability foundation, dr reiner könig, chairman executive board monetary stability foundation, conceive prepare conference. it wish conference ultimately help improve understand financial stability world experience rapid globalisation. i officially declare conference open shall give floor professor remsperger, chair today’s session second conference monetary stability foundation. bi review 35/2004 3 glenn stevens: economic condition prospect - june 2004 address mr glenn stevens, deputy governor reserve bank australia, committee economic development australia (queensland branch), brisbane, 2 june 2004. * * * thank invitation speak today. i plan cover evolve economic picture abroad home. a may know, bank release month ago late comprehensive treatment economy financial markets. the governor also due appear front parliamentary committee friday week, speak economy. my remark today, therefore, fit rather small window unfold narrative. accordingly, i begin major new line inquiry, mainly give brief update theme run time. the world economy it still case world economy gain strength, forecast economic growth generally move upwards. accord main official international body (the imf oecd), growth world economy 4½ per cent 2004 2005. if sequence occurs, strong two-year growth performance since late 1970s. of course, figure forecasts, guarantee performance. but stage year, would take something pretty dramatic change estimate outcome 2004 much. the strong number next year - fairly recent feature people’s

stability. there wide fluctuation norwegian economy 1970s 1980s. economic development mark high variable inflation. inflation rise gradually take long time fell. the absence nominal anchor one main reason behind pronounce swing norwegian economy. with policy low interest rate devaluations, inflation take root. nominal interest rate keep low level even though inflation value tax- deductible interest expense rose. frequent devaluation 1976 unable long term prevent decline manufacture sector. on contrary, prove self-reinforcing. the wide fluctuation culminate credit boom mid-1980s, rise cost consequence spring 1986 wage settlement. a pronounce downturn high unemployment follow end 1980s. in order achieve nominal stability, monetary policy must provide nominal anchor. since second world war, several monetary policy reform norway. in period 1972 1986, monetary policy limit extent focus stabilise rise prices. during period, inflation high variable. consumer price norway rise almost twice much germany. at time, value norwegian krone german mark almost halved, contribute high import inflation. from mid-1980s, credit bubble cost shock, recognise substantial revision economic policy would necessary problem create inflation take seriously. from 1986 1992, norway operate fix exchange rate regime. the fix exchange rate anchor inflation norway. the difference inflation norway germany narrow substantially. deteriorate competitiveness due high wage growth would long remedied mean devaluations. substantial emphasis place importance wage formation development employment. only wage growth drop level trade partner unemployment begin fall manufacture sector begin pick up. thus, fix exchange rate policy introduce order strengthen internationally expose business sector. on

autumn 1996, partly wage growth low overall demand generate pressure economy. gradually, krone begin show wide fluctuations. the experience last half 1990s demonstrate monetary policy cannot fine-tune exchange rate. development international financial market lead pronounce fluctuations. and fundamentally, labour market pressure rise income policy failed, exchange rate development long provide

towards end 1990s, increase emphasis place fundamental precondition exchange rate stability. monetary policy instrument orient view bring price cost inflation towards price stability objective european central bank (ecb). bi review 34/2004 1 monetary policy in countries, price stability, low stable inflation, objective monetary policy. historical experience norway country show absence price

explicit inflation target introduce new zealand 1990. canada follow 1991, uk 1992, sweden australia 1993. inflation target norm small medium-sized open economies. denmark important exception. since

influence movement krone exchange rate. the inflation outlook norway imply norway frontrunner country increase interest rates. a mention earlier, theme shift foreign exchange markets. norge bank instrument fine-tune exchange rate. normally, norge bank intervene foreign exchange market order influence exchange rate. foreign exchange market intervention, irrespective whether foreign exchange

distinguish speaker invite previous lectures. i would like refer jean-claude trichet, otmar issing, eddy george david dodge, colleague former colleague within eurosystem g10 governors’ group. i hope presentation interest colleague i great admiration for. the european economy face many challenges: consolidate current recovery, redress public finance deteriorate many countries, reduce unemployment still high preserve social cohesion, prepare age process particular financial consequences, i think one important: improve europe’s growth potential. it realisation prerequisite meet challenge mentioned. from outset i want make absolutely clear i neither eurosceptic europessimist. so, i fully acknowledge admire resound success european integration achieve two field past years. a central banker i would course first like refer introduction euro which, know, bring two stages. on 1 january 1999 financial market start use euro single monetary policy eurosystem implemented. three year late introduction euro note coin lead general use single currency economic agents, thereby away national currencies. this changeover single currency final touch european monetary integration profound effect deepen single market elimination exchange risk, reduction transaction cost increase price transparency. this improvement single market enhance overall efficiency european economy and, thing equal, also growth performance. however, doubtful whether population country correctly perceive latter advantage. indeed, introduction euro unfortunately coincide severe slump economic activity: 2000 real gdp growth euro area reach 3.5 p.c. decline follow year reach mere 0.4 p.c. 2003. early month european integration achieve another major success. ten new member state join european union, make european reunification almost complete. however, historic event occur immediately period sluggish economic growth leave european economy somewhat weakened. therefore, enlargement, instead generate enthusiasm, many instance give rise misgive among population even among enterprises. the concern regard possible delocalisation enterprise significant job losses. at microeconomic sectoral level, integration ten new member state undoubtedly entail adjustment shift overall result win-win situation. the past decade already bring strong expansion trade link old new eu member states. a purchase power country catch market become accessible, european firm set expand potential outlet continue dismantle trade barrier harmonisation regulatory framework gradually create level play field. the expansion trade lead increase specialisation, hence great productivity, well consumer wide choice produce benefit much large cost integration. bi review 34/2004 1 these two recent major event show insufficient growth real cause concern population country feel insecure employment. this factor obscure achievement european integration reach prevent people believe dynamism european unification. therefore weak growth could factor entail grow euroscepticism, especially western europe. for come month reasonable optimism justified. while late positive signal need confirm future developments, underpin expectation gradual recovery euro area continue strengthen time. the condition place. first, global economic upturn continue robust broadly based, geographically across sectors, world trade also strengthened. in context favourable external environment, euro area export expect grow significantly year next. second, favourable finance conditions, improvement corporate efficiency earn

utilisation euro area. in euro area unemployment rate 2 bi review 34/2004 currently around 3 percentage point higher, labour force participation rate 10 percentage point low annual hour work per employ person low 300 hours. europe course us. it specificity take account. so least part gap average hour work u euro area attribute structural preference rather structural rigidites. however, discuss issue bear mind household also take account institutional environment, include tax, social security pension system decide labour supply. moreover, problem extent present european system sustainable cannot ignored. the so-called european model come increase pressure demographic factors. further policy change towards stimulate labour supply inevitable live standard social cohesion preserved. unlike social preference rigidities, macroeconomic policy ust see explanation weak growth euro area. first hold true monetary policy. a know, treaty maastricht unambiguously provide maintain price stability constitute primary objective european central bank. accord definition ecb clarify year ago aim create stable anchor price expectations, price stability imply annual rise harmonise index consumer price euro area close 2 p.c. this objective must maintain medium term. central banker prevent external shocks, rise commodity price international markets, result temporary rise inflation. but, preclude second-round effects. in conduct monetary policy, ecb already gain high degree credibility market participant show moderate inflation expectations. these expectation remain line target ecb able cut key interest rate historically low level (2 p.c. nominal term actually zero real terms). monetary policy thus make contribution towards stabilise economic activity euro area. ensure price stability, well confidence euro, best contribution high sustainable growth ecb make also allow advantage low medium long term market rate many european country still important finance investment enterprises, household government. in fiscal sphere, almost government euro zone allow automatic stabiliser take full effect recent slowdown, effect often reinforce discretionary measures. between 2000 2003, budgetary deficit general government euro area grow 0.9 p.c. gdp 2.7 p.c. the deficit country even exceed threshold 3 p.c. fiscal policy thus impediment recovery. one might however wonder whether stimulation economy intend fiscal ease many country erode adverse impact relaxation discipline climate confidence. it seem people europe “ricardian perception” fiscal deficits. they aware enormous challenge cost age society entails. people different european country really worry long-term sustainability public finances. high fiscal deficit worsen anxiety incite increase precautionary savings. in context, rule stability growth pact appropriate. it correct describe fiscal straitjacket. start budget balance surplus peak cycle, country let automatic stabiliser fully operate activity slow down. the main problem pact is, i think, good incentive need respect fiscal discipline good economic times. so i hope forthcoming recovery right moment european government face budgetary difficulties, put finance right track, field bi review 34/2004 3 possible reconcile short time flexibility long term sustainability. in case fiscal policy may become element require last macroeconomic stability. it pay attention quality public finance render structure tax expense growth orient government contribute stimulate europe’s growth potential. i refer expenditure

u figure lisbon target (3 p.c.). over past years, european policymakers become aware growth problem europe facing. so, march 2000, lisbon summit, ambitious strategy adopt aim increase rate sustainable economic growth even enable europe become competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world 2010. in order achieve strategic goal lisbon agenda bring together different strand reform policy product, labour capital market aim promote efficient allocation resource high growth potential. moreover, order facilitate monitor progress reforms, quantitative target fix measure progress particular labour market achieve instance high participation employment rates. the lisbon agenda excellent term diagnosis. until however give sufficiently powerful implementation. one cannot say progress last year field structural reforms, much remain done. the pace reform need significantly step lisbon target achieved. the review carry high level group chair former prime minister wim kok provide excellent opportunity accelerate process. progress tangible deregulate integrate product financial markets. since introduction euro, pace financial markets’ reform impressive. this include policy-induced reform, financial service action plan initiate european commission spring 1999. reform also cover market-led initiatives, instance development electronic trade platforms. a know, different financial market reach different level integration. so integration euro money market achieve quickly introduction new currency instance euro area equity market, despite advance set euronext, remain among least integrated. thus still need continuation completion. new progress result cohesive effective interplay free competition, coordinate action market participant policy enforcement public authorities. much progress also make regard integration level competition productmarkets. however substantial barrier free competition continue exist, particularly prevent integration services’ market effective competition network industries. foster competition field also contribute downward effect prices. further regulatory reform accompany sustain reduction state aid - particularly constitute economically questionable sector-specific measures. in end, promote entry new players, enhance innovation reduce tax burden. high unemployment insufficient employment rate still preoccupying. the labour market participation rate woman young old age group remain weak many countries. thus far, progress implementation labour market reform uneven euro area. in countries, significant achievement term low unemployment already visible. others lag behind. it important enhance flexibility labour market make whole european economy good able absorb economic shocks. reform also need reduce non-wage labour cost increase incentive job creation also ensure sustainability social security systems. the challenge know analysis completed. now implementation focus on. a i say begin speech, i neither eurosceptic europessimist. so i believe europe implement lisbon agenda. the introduction euro splendid example easy successful structural reform. it follow others. 4 bi review 34/2004 the framework lisbon agenda implement rely largely peer pressure mechanism, mainly depend goodwill government individual eu countries. the pressure must reinforced, include clearly identify publicise successful lag country case accross eu possibly industrialise country generally. communication must also improved. the transition pre-reform post-reform equilibrium condition normally take time must recognise within period uncertainty may occur. for reason implementation social reform require strong leadership continuous explanation effort. we convince public opinion country would good - growth job - could deliver reform lisbon agenda. i shall conclude last remark: current recovery economic activity, welcome is, must surely constitute pretext postpone program reforms, implementation essential achieve strong sustainable growth long term. bi review 34/2004 5 otmar issing: the euro lisbon agenda speech mr otmar issing, member executive board ecb, 32nd economics conference austrian national bank, 28 may 2004. * * * 1. introduction when european council agree so-called lisbon agenda march 2000 eu witness period high real growth rates. “the union experience best macro-economic outlook generation”, council conclude time. against background, lisbon european council set well-known strategic goal1 reach 2010 define broad agenda structural reform labour, product financial markets. four year later, real gdp growth drop significantly low levels. so far, many structural reform find difficult implement lisbon agenda’s mid-term goal 2005 unlikely reached. in following, i would first like draw attention economic benefit structural reform highlight deficiency implementation become particularly obvious. i concentrate two aspect regard lisbon agenda, i consider particular interest viewpoint single monetary policy. first, i would like focus way structural reform change economic environment single monetary policy conducted. second, i would like highlight turn monetary policy support lisbon process. third finally, i argue exploit euro area’s growth potential help structural reform contribute global economic growth thus indispensable reduce exist global economic imbalances. 2. main element lisbon agenda let first briefly explain european country must proceed structural reform continuously ask euro area member state step reform effort regard. well-designed structural reform increase mobility production factor different us improve allocation economy towards efficient use. in so, structural reform raise factor productivity, open additional employment opportunity allow low price good services. exploit opportunity efficient allocation production factor eventually allow economy achieve high real income high sustainable long-run growth path. in last decade, euro area country make considerable progress reform labour, product capital markets, varying, however, considerably across countries. among outcome high level competition product market due to, example, low level state aid regulatory reform network industry result substantial price reduction well high activity. for example, 2000 mid-2003 alone, price decline telecommunication service measure hicp sub-index telecommunication lead cumulate downward effect total hicp inflation 0.33 percentage point.2 moreover, positive effect real acticity support creation new jobs. at time, labour market reform undertake 1990s seem contribute strong employment growth considerable decline unemployment many country cyclical upswing 1997 2000. reform measure field included, example, improvement countries’ job mediation systems, intensive use part-time work contract well policy raise efficiency tax benefit systems. with so-called lisbon agenda european council intend reinforce reform efforts. it identify various area reform, summarise employment, research innovation, single market, social cohesion well sustainable development environment. i think 1 namely, “to become competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world capable sustainable economic growth good job great social cohesion” 2010. 2 see ecb monthly bulletin (2003), pp 26. bi review 33/2004 1 agree step structural reform area indispensible improve euro area’s unsatisfactory growth potential ability create employment, even eu enlarge country substantially low labour costs. the euro area’s insufficient flexibility manifest high rate unemployment, amount 8.8% 2003. this reveal shortcoming implementation structural refoms would improve use euro area’s productive force increase flexibility response economic shocks. it thus crucial lisbon agenda’s impetus maintained, must manifest increase effort reach agenda’s 2010 targets. there is, however, still long way go. for example, raise euro area overall employment rate 70% 2010 expect require additional 15.3 million jobs, although hide significantly vary challenge different group labour market. whereas, example, significant progress make raise female employment, employment growth old worker age 55-64 would substantially exceed annual average 1.7% 1996 2002 achieve employment target old worker 50% 2010. make lisbon agenda success therefore require particular effort field labour market reform open additional employment opportunities. at time, structural reform need increase prerequisite innovation, research development, particularly provide educational attainment level adequate labour market needs. furthermore, continuation reform capital markets, removal barrier competition particularly service sector well liberalisation electricity, postal service transport envisage lisbon agenda needed. i would like conclude part speech three remarks: first, trust course structural reform foster lisbon agenda good understand economic benefit structural reform entail conducive raise consumer confidence private consumption. it thus indispensible maintain trust course, keep commitment also period slow growth. second, numeric target seem currently central measure benchmark progress structural reforms. a numeric target increase necessary pressure underperform countries, consider strengthen instrument. third, know, implementation change long-grown relationship always difficult task. when ask willingness reform general, large part population would probably signal high degree approval. but soon concrete measure would harm personal status-quo, minority would agree. the main challenge lisbon agenda’s success thus persuade people long-term benefit structural reform remove scepticism respect short-term costs. in regard, also ecb play part communication benefit structural reforms. 3. the impact structural reform conduct monetary policy let turn discussion implication implementation lisbon agenda may conduct monetary policy euro area. the ecb always stress importance swift implementation structural reform agenda across euro area. this reflect firm belief structural reform enhance welfare european citizens. but structural reform also tend facilitate monetary policy increase effectiveness. a flexible economic environment help labour product market good adjust economic shock respond policy action quickly. for example, flexible labour market may imply negative supply shock absorb small short-term increase inflationary pressures, second round effect subdued. this, turn, allow monetary policy react le strongly. such environment make easy monetary policy maintain price stability, also help keep volatility inflation output lower. but also challenge central bank, arise uncertainty relate change economic environment monetary policy operates. more precisely, structural reform may change rule govern dynamic evolution euro area economy transmission 2 bi review 33/2004 mechanism monetary policy action way difficult identify short run. i shall try, now, elaborate detail. normally, economist think structural reform positive “supply” effect allow firm increase productivity, time foster aggregate demand. from point view monetary policymaker adopt forward look strategy, understand nature change supply potential economy crucial assess extent shock impact price stability. moreover, change potential output growth impact determination “equilibrium” real interest rate, well optimal time path towards equilibrium real rate. a first approach outline issue simplify assumption potential output real equilibrium interest rate estimate high degree precision. in case positive supply shock lead one-off increase level potential output, permanently high output growth,3 equilibrium real rate would change. however, shock permanent4 lead high potential output growth return capital increase equilibrium real interest rate follow. this imply long run policy rate need high otherwise. once possibly new “equilibrium” interest rate potential output growth pin down, central bank set interest rate take consideration large set indicators, include short-term interaction aggregate demand supply. in case positive supply shock actual potential output accelerate simultaneously demand supply effect emerge time magnitude. if case, thing equal, monetary policy would essentially need align short-term rate high equilibrium real interest rate consistent permanently high potential growth. in different situation, instance supply effect dominate short-run5 increase productivity potential output level bring structural reform often tend reduce short-term inflationary pressures. in case, central bank would position eventually adjust short-term rate gradually towards high “equilibrium” long potential gdp temporarily expand rapidly demand and, consequently, inflationary pressure remain muted. everything said, however, presume concept like precise level equilibrium interest rate, natural rate unemployment potential output observe estimate sufficient degree confidence central bank. in reality case. monetary policy decision take real time without benefit hindsight, always face particularly high degree uncertainty long-run trend macroeconomic variable change, also fundamental relation link macroeconomic variable change way could render exist model transmission mechanism unreliable. in situation, monetary policy decision-making call great caution kind mechanistic reactions, particular indicator whose development difficult interpret, avoided. it seem plausible environment high uncertainty, monetary policy efficient assign prominent role indicator precisely measure estimate rather concept estimate high degree uncertainty. this one reason typically, central bank rely “output gap” estimates. furthermore, cross-check available information, central bank must carefully take consideration possibility structural break historical relationship well signal send different model context various type approaches. in end, assess appropriateness monetary policy stance prospect achieve medium term objective central bank make sure incorporate information embed economic monetary analysis. the ecb’s monetary policy strategy design precisely aim ensure assessment risk price stability relevant information would lose appropriate 3 for example, one-off increase employment and/or labour productivity due flexible labour market allow worker re-allocated efficiently. 4 for example high trend productivity growth result increase ability firm adopt new production technology flexible economic environment. 5 because consumer smooth expenditure credit-market imperfection constrain borrow (higher) future expect income. bi review 33/2004 3 attention would pay different analytical perspectives. it two-pillar approach way convey public notion diversify analysis ensure robust decision-making environment characterise high uncertainty. this approach also allow ecb ass impact structural reform cyclical long-term component inflation process euro area. a note before, case reform increase potential output growth euro area, ecb take consideration short-term relative development aggregate demand supply. furthermore, ass assumption desirable medium term evolution monetary aggregate potential growth change. let give example go back 2001, context well know debate emergence possibly “new economy” govern council decide ass potential change trend productivity growth euro area implication reference value monetary growth. the conclusion december 2001 decisive evidence measurable last increase productivity growth euro area would warrant upward revision trend potential growth.6 the govern council therefore opt favour rather cautious attitude and, benefit hindsight, correct - thus avoid possible policy mistake. 4. price stability lisbon agenda i would like outline ecb contribute support implementation lisbon agenda. in short, contribute maintain price stability help safeguard financial stability contribution stable macroeconomic environment. in stable macroeconomic environment, structural reform easy implement. let explain relationship look aspect price stability. • first, price stability preserve bolster consumers’ purchase power, thus support consumption. • second, price stability enhance efficiency market system allocate resources, make easy people recognise change relative prices. • third, price stability avoid additional menu costs, i.e. production cost occur print price changed. • fourth, price stability associate low uncertainty risk premia financial markets, facilitate financial action ultimately imply low medium long-term interest rates, foster investment. • fifth, price stability provide market indispensable nominal anchor adjust change wage consistently productivity growth. • sixth, price stability prevent considerable arbitrary redistribution wealth income arise inflationary well deflationary environments. in regard, price stability vital element foster sustainable growth well support employment social cohesion, thus support lisbon process achieve objectives. moreover, price stability help guide economic agent decision move production factor towards efficient us help structural reform exploit welfare-enhancing benefits. a additional aspect, within environment stable prices, decline relative price sector result structural reform would become visible, support acceptance reforms. price stability thus important contribution monetary policy lisbon process. 6 “... the govern council belief potential upward impact trend output growth structural reform technological innovation could large. however, progress make field structural reform, significant step - especially labour good market - need take order achieve permanent significant increase potential output growth euro area. against background, govern council continue monitor evidence regard development productivity growth euro area, ecb’s monetary policy take evidence account appropriate.”. see ecb press release 6 december 2001. 4 bi review 33/2004 empirical estimation show even rather low rate inflation lead welfare loss might large usually thought. a study us, example, indicate permanent increase inflation rate 0% 4% lead permanent output loss range 0.4-1.1%.7 there are, however, several argument support base definition price stability positive low inflation rates. the ecb thus provide quantitative definition price stability, namely year-on-year increase hicp euro area whole 2% maintain medium term. look back, last five years, despite significant exogenous shock ecb’s stability-oriented monetary policy follow definition result medium term low stable inflation. and ensure medium long-run inflation expectation well anchored. monetary policy thus deliver necessary contribution stable macroeconomic environment support implementation structural reforms. perhaps le well-known also important ecb’s escb’s contribution stable macroeconomic environment promote financial stability. this task crucial well-developed stable financial system improve efficiency finance decisions, favour good allocation investment among economy thus support economic growth. this also recognise lisbon council call accelerate completion internal market financial service “exploit potential euro” achieve aim. the task escb regard consist systematically monitor financial stability condition eu euro area countries. this monitor particularly aim identify potential source vulnerability financial system euro area eu ass resilience shocks. to sum up, maintain price stability vital contribution foster non-inflationary sustainable growth and, together financial stability, support stable macroeconomic environment, within structural reform fully exploit welfare enhance effects. maintain price stability promote financial stability thus assistance monetary policy render lisbon agenda’s reform efforts. 5. global aspect increase euro area’s insufficient growth potential ability adjust flexibly change economic variable become particularly important background globalisation. this even case last year international trade goods, capital service witness imbalances. these imbalance signal by, example, persistent u current account deficit, amount around 5% gdp. this connect increase u net liability vis-à-vis rest world 5% early 1990s roughly 23% gdp end 2002. these imbalance finally corrected. an adjustment can, however, bring several ways: first, deficit country’s growth rate could decline relative growth rate rest world. this would, among others, reduce country’s demand foreign good services, potentially hamper real growth reduce export elsewhere world. second, global imbalance could diminish acceleration growth rest world would lead increase demand deficit country’s exports. the flexible adjustment decline global imbalance is, orderly necessary adjustment bring about, mean le le sudden disruption key economic variables. one may conjecture that, net outflow good capital, part adjustment also fall upon euro area. in u view seem prevail, one could paraphrase previous statement u treasury secretary connolly respect u currency: “it may deficit, problem”. one characteristic “problem” large outflow investment capital eu euro area towards region world u market particular. one reason large flow capital towards u market second half 1990s surely overly optimistic expectation regard “new economy”. consider investment since 1997, rough estimate indicate eu investor incur tremendous losses, range eur 200 billion eur 540 billion mid-2002. however, large aggregate outflow 7 dotsey, m p ireland (1996): “the welfare cost inflation general equilibrium”, journal monetary economics 45, 631-55. bi review 33/2004 5 capital europe take sign insufficient attractiveness internationally mobile capital. have say this, euro area support reduction global imbalance much strong contribution global growth. this require euro area exploit growth potential become attractive place invest. again, call improve function labour, product capital markets, partly insufficient flexibility find act impediment invest several euro area economies. raise rate investment help structural reform therefore crucial measure increase euro area’s ability adjust decline global imbalances. by allow achieve high sustainable growth rate structural reform also indirectly contribute global growth thus reduce global imbalances.8 6. conclusion the lisbon agenda press eu country make homework field structural reform. however, whereas progress made, deficiency remain, particularly labour service markets. reform labour market have, however, find hard implement time accompany tensions. i hope olivier blanchard right end assessment tension “are symptom change, immobility”.9 the lisbon agenda crucial raise europe’s attention necessity structural reforms. country implement well-designed policy remedy root cause particular problem labour, product financial markets. these structural reform improve environment, stability-oriented monetary policy conducted. in turn, process reform best implement within stable macroeconomic environment microeconomic policy fully develop welfare-enhancing effects. the single monetary policy continue play part respect maintain price stability promote financial stability. 8

* * * it seem probable danish economy reach trough autumn 2003 upswing set in; upswing acknowledge now, near middle 2004. the upswing primarily reflect private consumption, addition unemployment fall slightly since turn year. naturally, final impact unemployment difficult predict since unemployment typically react considerable vary lag. unlike western european countries, denmark relatively low unemployment rate, strong upswing could lead overheating. the great risk would substantial economic upswing materialise neighbour countries, indication this. germany, particular, difficulty boost economy. a positive aspect growth 10 new eu member state four per cent, although account four per cent denmark’s exports. in short term would seem domestically drive consumption boom substantial increase consumption ratio could lead overheating. the consumption ratio currently low, wealth ratio high. consequently, mark consumption effect cannot rule out. the reversal danish economy emphasis difficult finetune economy mean fiscal policy. our knowledge incomplete. it take time prepare fiscal-policy measures, take time impact unemployment. such measure easily disruptive effect economy

udviklingslinier økonomisk teori - trend economic theory - (2000, ed. chr. hjorth-andersen). if fiscal policy eased, must also tighten late stage; otherwise possible maintain long-term target development public finances. the reflection sustainability public finance consultation paper emphasise need subsequent fiscal-policy adjustment. in order sustainable, public finance must comply budgetary restriction effect future government revenue must match current government debt future government expenditure. such restriction mean budgetary relaxation must subsequently counterbalance

symposium asian economy financial markets, singapore, 27 may 2004. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentlemen, let first welcome conference board symposium asian economy financial markets, hold first time singapore. asia’s comeback since financial crisis asian economy come long way since financial crisis 1997. for six year tumultuous ride, mark unexpected shock painful adjustments. the september 11th attack follow bali marriot bomb indonesia, shake confidence region bring harsh reality islamist extremist terrorism close home. last year, iraq war sars outbreak weaken business sentiment consumer spending, set back economic recovery yet again. prospect region since brighten considerably, strength synchronise upturn g3 economies. the electronics industry, lynchpin export-driven asian economies, finally pick robustly prolong slump. investor confidence returned, bond spread narrowed, stock market outperform develop countries, recently. the asian crisis force government region tackle weakness financial corporate sector implement much need structural reforms. weak bank recapitalised, bad loan reduced, prudential regulation strengthened. government finance put firm footing, balance payment move surplus. the result strong lean asia, prepare storm ready seize opportunities. a major development recent year emergence china economic powerhouse. china’s growth transformation phenomenal. it buoyant exports, support low-cost manufacture capabilities, huge domestic market, create strong competition well immense opportunity rest world. china’s growth drive rapid increase intra-regional trade, fuel economic expansion region, worldwide. china’s economy show sign overheating, government mindful danger determine act decisively rein credit investment. this give good chance achieve soft landing. beyond cyclical issue, china set continue grow strongly next decade two. the asian giant, india, become dynamic prosperous economy. liberalisation policy market reform free long moribund indian economy. state-owned enterprise privatised. ports, airports, telecommunication financial service open competition foreign participation. a dead hand bureaucracy withdrawn, growth take off, especially service sector. with well-trained, english speaking, cost-competitive professionals, india create niche world’s back-office well global software centre. the bjp coalition’s unexpected defeat general election reflect unhappiness rural voter benefit liberalisation. this may cause new congress government circumspect press ahead reforms, although optimistic commentator argue voter press fast reform rather slower. whether so, policy liberalisation command bipartisan support, likely continue. after all, new prime minister, dr manmohan singh, architect initial economic reform early 1990s. he appoint finance minister mr chidambaram, also reformist former commerce minister finance minister. i therefore hopeful thrust liberalisation continue, india play increasingly prominent role like china’s regional global economies. close home, prospect southeast asian economy also look better. the region initially struggle political security concern deter foreign investment distract bi review 33/2004 1 government tackle serious economic problems. but southeast asia stabilise considerably recent years. government respond vigorously threat terrorism restore order confidence. the political upheaval sweep across region also subsided, allow government focus attention foster growth development. the thai economy do particularly well. for past year fast grow economy southeast asia. through series bold initiatives, thai government revive rural economy, stimulate domestic demand, repay imf loans. this bolster confidence get business move again. indonesia’s economy improve significantly despite complex political situation. reform slow initially, corruption unreliable legal system impede progress. nevertheless, indonesia make significant headway financial sector reforms. ibra accelerate pace bank asset sales, non-performing loan ratio fell nearly 50% 1998 8% last year. indonesia graduate imf programme december 2003, continue maintain sound macroeconomic policies. while foreign direct investment remain slow, oversubscribed us$1 billion sovereign bond sale march year vote confidence international investors. the challenge long term attract enough investment

steps, give year ago india pakistan brink nuclear war. both country know conflict kashmir would disastrous consequence far outweigh possible gains. it would grievously disrupt india’s economic reform perhaps permanently 2 bi review 33/2004 relegate india behind china. for pakistan, could mean end state presently exists. it therefore good sign new indian government signal wish continue dialogue

share common interest peaceful resolution issue. kim jong il master brinkmanship. but rational must know war lead outcome fear most, disappearance north korea sovereign state. therefore, may go edge, unlike saddam hussein, kim deliberately step it. the north korean issue strong incentive u china cooperate common interest. the risk miscalculation perhaps high taiwan. the issue extremely delicate engage domestic politics china, u taiwan. there grow tension economic force integrate taiwan mainland taiwan’s desire separate identity. no prc leadership ever tolerate bid independence taiwan. if taiwan push far, chinese must react expose ‘paper tiger’. the u stand, perception u stand china taiwan, key problem. president bush say publicly support taiwan’s independence. but u may still draw cross strait conflict. if happens, serious consequence entire region. but encourage chen shui-bian’s inauguration speech take conciliatory tone, suggest aware grave dangers, although still leave open possibility independence. in southeast asia, terrorism major preoccupation many year come. another terrorist attack shake confidence southeast asia, damage growth prospects. the southeast asian waterway vital lifeline japan, china south korea. a maritime terrorist attack disrupt wide economic political repercussions. unfortunately, widespread discomfort among muslim everywhere american policy middle east towards israel palestine conflict. mainstream muslim afraid speak extremist fear appear pro american. this serious problem yet adequately addressed. one important question role islam southeast asian countries. traditional southeast asian islam syncretic tolerant, increasingly influence austere middle eastern variant islam, especially wahhabbism. which way battle soul islam go key uncertainty determine future region. in malaysia, prime minister abdullah badawi clear victory pas, opposition islamist party. he challenge pas’ contention malaysia islamic state, instead fight pa kind islamic state malaysia be. his victory bolster vision progressive islam encourage mainstream muslim everywhere. but pa give gird long-term struggle. in indonesia, significant three major presidential candidate secular nationalists. but three also find necessary seek vice presidential candidate strong muslim credentials, support muslim parties. although indonesia long history tolerant, syncretic islam, southeast asian countries, political islam centre indonesian politics crucial swing factor. in thailand, prime minister thaksin’s pro business pro growth economic policy find resonance muslim south. the recent upsurge islamic separatist violence worrying, though far evidence international terrorist connections. southeast asian governments, even large muslim populations, secular, moderate intent economic growth. if progressive moderate force win global battle heart mind muslims, southeast asia perhaps favourable battleground. rid asia’s growth this backdrop give hope strategic security environment asia remain stable. i also optimistic asian country continue maintain stable political environments, pursue pro-business economic policies, participate global economy. one significant economic issue country must tackle strengthen develop financial sectors. bi review 33/2004 3 asian country need two-pronged approach this. first, foster great regional cooperation financial market leverage collective strength. second, individual country need press unfinished financial reform take judicious step liberalise financial sector. great regional cooperation on regional

singapore’s financial system lucky emerge asian crisis relatively unscathed. during crisis, undertake extensive liberalisation program aim deepen broaden capital markets, consolidate upgrade local banks, enhance singapore’s position international financial centre. at time, put place new supervisory framework oversee financial institutions, shift one-size-fits-all regulation risk-based supervision. 4 bi review 33/2004 our effort achieve encourage results. our debt market grow three-fold since 1998 reach s$90 billion 2002, drive grow demand region debt financing. our wealth management industry double period, total asset under management grow s$150 billion 1998 s$344 billion 2002. in treasury activities, maintain position fourth large fx centre world, average daily trade volume us$119 billion 2003. the local bank consolidate seven three bank large stronger, build regional footprints. in recent financial system stability assessment singapore, imf affirm robustness singapore’s financial system soundness legal, supervisory institutional framework. we hearten outcomes. but still need press reform policy adjustments, international financial landscape continue evolve. in regard, let highlight two thing ma doing. revision capital adequacy requirement locally incorporate bank first, ma revise capital adequacy requirement locally incorporate banks. singapore bank since 1992 require meet minimum capital adequacy ratio, car, requirement 12%. ma progressively adjust requirement.1 however, current ma requirement 12% total car 8% must tier 1 capital still exceed major financial centres. a part mas’ effort keep regulatory framework up-to-date international best practices, start review car requirement march last year. i sure industry please know ma complete review. ma announce detail press conference tomorrow evening. i touch briefly three component revisions. (i) minimum car the first change minimum car requirement local banks. ma low minimum car 10%, least 7% comprise tier 1 capital. this competitive, take account small open economy, systemic importance three local banks. some countries, include switzerland, similarly high requirement develop jurisdictions. this reduction minimum car necessarily translate full 2% low total car requirement parallel this, ma amend rule compute car, second component package car revisions. (ii) change car computation rule one noteworthy revision computation rule requirement bank set aside capital significant investments, commensurate risk associate investments. we state august last year would done, extend two year grace period singapore bank divest non-financial businesses.2another significant revision allow bank include 45% revaluation surplus banks’ hold property asset well portfolio equity investment upper tier 2 capital. this raise capital available banks, unlikely offset high capital set aside significant investments. in line policy set transparent requirements, ma publish car requirement computation rules. local bank report car base revise rule start second quarter financial results. 1 ma low tier 1 component 12% 10% november 1998, 10% 8% september 2000. 2 “extension grace period bank divestment non-financial businesses”, ma press release, 22 august 2003. bi review 33/2004 5 (iii) bank specific supervisory car requirements. the third component supervisory car. like supervisors, ma may impose additional bank-specific supervisory car address risk adequately cover minimum requirement. ma refine framework set supervisory car add-ons. it take advantage mas’ exist risk-based supervisory approach base mas’ risk assessment individual banks. in line international practice, supervisory car add-on keep confidential. impact revision the adjustment car framework allow local bank manage capital flexibly. bank low risk profile good manage enjoy low total regulatory car requirement before. at time, adjustment maintain prudential standard observe supervisor major financial centres, tend stringent minimum standard stipulate current capital accord. overall, change result modest meaningful reduction car requirements, may may translate immediate capital reduction banks. lead bank tend maintain capital level well regulatory minimums, undoubtedly prove case singapore well. in manage capital positions, bank also take account future expansion plans, well risk potentially face business environment. non-internationalisation singapore dolla (s$) policy the second policy adjustment concern non-internationalisation singapore dollar. monetary policy singapore centre management exchange rate. a international financial centre open capital markets, expose large sometimes, volatile capital flows. to facilitate effective conduct monetary policy avoid large swing s$ exchange rate, policy discourage internationalisation s$. however, recognise trade-off le vibrant capital market, particularly debt market. so progressively relax specific restriction past six years, maintain intent policy. the result positive. the non-internationalisation policy two basic safeguard discourage speculation s$ - bank may lend s$ non-resident financial institution order speculate s$, non-resident borrower raise s$ bank borrow capital market must swap convert s$ foreign currency remit abroad. this stance remain appropriate, continue underpin effective conduct monetary policy. nevertheless, scope fine-tuning. we decide non-resident, non-financial issuer s$ bond equity long require swap convert s$ proceed foreign currency remit abroad. non-resident, financial issuer bond equity still so. this give issuer great flexibility manage s$ funds. in addition, ma exempt restriction policy, extension temporary overdraft s$ vostro account prevent settlement failures. this facilitate straight-through process efficient handle s$ payments. with progressive relaxation s$ restrictions, current policy essentially limit lend s$ non-resident financial institution purpose speculate s$, specifically seek prevent internationalisation s$. the present label: “non-internationalisation s$” may suggest singapore restrict foreign participation s$ markets, do. we therefore also decide rename policy "lending s$ non-resident financial institutions". conclusion asia remarkable recovery look forward period renew growth prosperity. financial market play major role process. despite strategic security 6 bi review 33/2004 risk region, political situation generally stable positive. there challenge ahead, great regional collaboration

growth, highlight irish case keynote address mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, deliver whitaker lecture organise central bank financial service authority ireland, dublin, 31 may 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it real pleasure speak inaugural lecture honour dr. t.k. whitaker, several reasons. firstly, i satisfaction honour great man, great european great central banker. dr. whitaker man whose inspiration effort use critical time irish history bring ireland journey transformation economic stagnation position stun exemplary economic success. secondly, you, dr. whitaker, deserve take satisfaction pride know contribution success irish economy bound ireland’s shores. rather process transformation begin four decade ago become model million new citizen european union. the new member state eu confront economic challenge whose magnitude long-term importance similar face ireland begin work. thank ireland’s economic success, devote life, confident economic reform works. today i opportunity highlight importance structural fiscal reform enlarge europe. ireland’s contribution area confine inspiration exemplary policy record. the irish presidency european union work stimulate progress structural reform prioritisation lisbon agenda. together great event european union enlargement progress make areas, source pride ireland. speak ireland’s eu presidency, note outgo president european parliament, pat cox, also irish, i cannot resist mention pride celtic root native “breton”! before experience economic spring, ireland go long winter economic inertia. for decade establishment ireland’s independence climate economic social pessimism become prevalent country appear little offer citizen prospect emigration low revenues. between 1951 1958, europe’s economy rebounded, ireland’s relative gdp per caput actually fell 75 60 per cent eu average. it year 1958 important turn point make irish modern economic history: the programme economic expansion publish leadership inspiration secretary department finance. this publication point way appear intractable downward spiral weaken economic activity, high inflation, low live standards, chronic unemployment level emigration comparable birth rate. with emphasis free trade, increase competition need end protectionism, document point way ireland become economically open, industrially diverse increasingly confident future. your inspiration follow action ireland’s top public servant. in year 1958, industrial development authority created, bring stimulus foreign investment irish economy. subsequently, guide ireland’s programme trade liberalisation structural reform 1960s. economic growth accelerate result. in 1973 ireland accede eu process play significant role governor irish central bank. so far i look backward true central bank style i do i may look forward, particular challenge face europe now. in enlarge europe, vision display inspiring, design implement economic reform 1950s relevant u today. bi review 33/2004 1 allow focus theme particular important topic structural reform fiscal consolidation, explain merits, include light irish experience economic monetary union highly successful foster macroeconomic stability europe. the ecb provide contribution success safeguard price stability euro area. however, important effort still need fully realise advantage stable single currency. structural reform design increase flexibility market offer key achieve high sustainable growth, increase employment, promote innovation secure sustainability social security system eu. they furthermore enhance capacity participate country cushion macroeconomic shocks. by contrast, rigid labour, product financial market are, high employment income loss experience response change domestic global economic conditions. it widely recognise structural reform need improve prospect euro area. give demographic eu le dynamic economies, include us, case decisive implementation structural reform even pressing. this say progress structural reform across europe past years. indeed, number government make important significant step address structural rigidity countries. progress uneven however still distance cover reach goal set. the impetus determine structural reform capital, labour product market would set motion virtuous circle increase confidence: credible reform are, confidence create, confidence created, sooner positive result visible. so, i would like give example i think progress structural reform need europe, enhance job creation, growth economic resilience. one difficult persistent challenge face europe reduce structural unemployment elevate level activity rate. in 2003, 9% labour force european union unemployed, level three percentage point high us. the rate youth unemployment double adult unemployment. the overall rate activity around 62 % euro area around 75 % unite states. some country start reform social security system unemployment scheme early retirement incentive reduced. but progress type necessary attract people labour market, particularly europe’s population become older, reach goal set lisbon agenda, namely rate activity 70 % 2010. in number cases, together high marginal tax rates, legal regulatory environment europe continue provide disincentive take work continue work late life. and, still, certain sector activity, large mismatch skill vacancies, imply need improve education training. finally, wage strongly reflect regional sectoral productivity differences. eu country also make progress product market reform 1990s, positive effect integration level competition good markets, barrier competition innovation europe remain. attention pay particular share eu internal market legislation yet transpose national laws, incomplete integration service sector, new job created, remain regulation hamper internal market. progress front extremely important many form national regulation hamper integration competition keep price level observe integrate markets. furthermore, state subsidy particular sectoral aid continue distort european product market. the lisbon target r&d investment reach 3% gdp, two-thirds finance privately, yet achieved. finally much progress achieve capital market reforms, least due introduction euro. but integration national capital market towards truly european financial market could make even important contribution safeguard country-specific shocks. it would also result great availability risk capital - particularly innovative enterprise - and, generally, reduction finance cost productive investments. structural reform capital market aim allow effective allocation save toward reward investment opportunities. further effort also make promote foreign investment euro area order attract additional capital promote great transfer technology. in context, one consider astonish experience ireland, recover poor economic fiscal condition mid-1980s impressive pace economic activity sound 2 bi review 33/2004 fiscal position decade. in addition favourable macroeconomic environment benefit derive participation european union, economic recovery ground far-reaching home make structural reform labour, capital product markets. the strengthen labour market strongly underpin supportive policy framework. a strong pickup labour supply impressive productivity gain associate favourable demographic and, recently, increase skilled immigration. furthermore, unemployment dramatically reduce efficient match individual job vacancies. labour market participation, include women, increase structural reform reduce tax wedge human capital labour force upgrade significant investment education. ireland’s economic success therefore link transformation labour market plentiful supply competitively price quality labour resources. important success also make structural reform within product capital markets. the liberalisation trade investment single european market programme positive effect output productivity put downward pressure cost prices. good market become integrated. research development support dynamic gain fast growth. foreign direct investment also make significant contribution ireland’s grow economy. this stream ireland, place country one premier host country u foreign direct investment world 1990s. the eu’s structural cohesion fund well use improve ireland’s infrastructure educational system. moreover, ireland develop transparent regulatory framework. to conclude structural reforms, i think key issue bridge gap strategy implementation europe - identify best policy practice make structural reform happen. the european union number useful institutional instrument process place, broad economic policy guidelines, employment guideline spring european council, foster implementation. in respect, ecb always back diagnosis, agenda goal adopt lisbon european council 2000. the presidency conclusion spring 2004 european council deliver message determination confidence reinforce validity relevance lisbon process. we consensus “road map”. the issue today improve “navigation”, improve decision make process effective delivery reforms. convince people europe european citizen good thank reform absolutely key. the success ireland largely due fact irish citizen rightly convince road map would improve situation. move second topic speech, i.e. fiscal policies, let stress european bold create single currency absence political federation, federal government federal budget euro area level. some observer indeed argue without federal budget significance policy mix would erratic, depend random behaviour different national fiscal policy member countries. they also argue without federal budget would impossible weather, help fiscal channel, asymmetric shock hit one particular member economy. in respect, existence stability growth pact actually allow refute two arguments: first, maastricht treaty pact provide mutual surveillance “peers”- i.e minister finance - national fiscal policies; second, call upon member state maintain budget close balance surplus medium term, pact allow automatic stabiliser play full country face economic downturn, without breach 3% ceiling deficit. beyond economic underpinnings, consideration worth mentioning: fiscal policy set accord rule add macroeconomic stability provide agent expectation predictable economic environment; reduce uncertainty promote long term decision making, notably investment decisions, economic growth; addition, sound fiscal policy contribute low risk premia long term interest rate thus support favourable finance conditions; finally, fiscal discipline prevent spill-over effect one country another form high interest rates. some people argue fiscal consolidation detrimental demand economic activity. i would maintain wealth expectational effect well-designed consolidation programme might much reduce possibly even outweigh traditional keynesian multiplier effect fiscal policy demand activity. if fiscal consolidation perceive private sector credible sign public spend permanently low future years, household revise upwards expect permanent income anticipation low future taxes. therefore, current plan consumption also increase. bi review 33/2004 3 in addition, fiscal consolidation might improve long-term finance condition way le demand save pool (reducing crowd out) low risk premia government paper. hence, wealth effect prompt low nominal real interest rate would support large consumption. furthermore, follow favourable finance conditions, private investment also likely increase. the case expansionary effect supply side, via improve competitiveness economy, also important. if fiscal consolidation induce moderate effect wage demand, relative unit labour cost might decrease, positive medium-term effect real gdp growth great competitiveness productive sector. such effect buoy low expect tax rate efficient public expenditure enhance work incentive investment environment. it also important recognise fiscal policy promote growth employment via appropriate reallocation level composition government tax expenditure without hamper respect fiscal rules. reduce inefficient public spend reduce disincentive work help finance tax cuts. furthermore, public expenditure redirect towards productivity-enhancing physical human capital accumulation rather than, example, provision subsidy decline industries. in respect, dramatic acceleration output ireland post 1987 period associate vigorous successful project fiscal consolidation start 1987. this programme base tight expenditure control via subsidy cuts, social security reform streamline public sector control public expenditure. ireland’s experience, similar danish experience 1983-89, clearly show policy gear fiscal consolidation necessarily entail contractionary effect real aggregate demand economic activity. on contrary, two countries, spite tighten policy undertaken, rate growth show significant increase relation previous years. in particular, countries, significant budget consolidation base spend reduction enhance long term fiscal sustainability increase policy credibility favourable tax regime. regard ireland, budget deficit reduce 10.1% gdp 1986 1.7% 1989, debt ratio decline 113% gdp 100.4% gdp; period gdp growth accelerate 0.3% 6.2%; overall consolidation effort, measure structural fiscal balance, amount 5.1% gdp three years. in year afterwards, ireland continue enjoy high rate gdp growth keep large structural fiscal surplus (almost always 5% gdp), thus allow steady rapid decline debt ratio (which reach 32.4% gdp 2003). the irish danish experience bring evidence expansionary expectation effect may dominate contractionary effect fiscal consolidation. in case considerable evidence consumer boom prompt wealth effect cut public spending, signal low future taxes, concomitantly wealth effect imply fall interest rates. on supply side, low tax environment underpin pick economic activity ireland. come back europe whole, confidence among european citizen vital strong economic recovery sustain growth. the ecb’s govern council recognise still moderate level consumer confidence relate part debate appropriate path fiscal policy structural reform many country euro area. also reason, progress implementation necessary structural reform determine effort establish sound fiscal position medium term key strong confidence. the successful implementation structural economic fiscal reform require significant tireless effort explanation, pedagogy adequate public communication. over time, everybody benefit growth, employment opportunities. these gain reform often overlook public debate. in fact, formidable challenge gain support public opinion implement structural reforms. what implication current economic environment? fiscal imbalance quite significant number eu country deficit public debt ratio high. for countries, solid economic reason argue credible fiscal consolidation would boost growth net terms, so-called “ricardian” effect important “keynisian” effect. reduce imbalance likely positive expectational effect favourable tax regime good finance condition future. 4 bi review 33/2004 moreover, would probably agree tax spend ratio country high unfavourable investment economic dynamism. expenditure-based fiscal consolidation reform would credibly reduce disincentive work, invest innovate could significant confidence effect even short run. to conclude, i would like return lisbon reform agenda set 2000, ambitious, time, absolutely necessary. it clear implement effectively necessary reform would real challenge challenge require win heart trust people. indeed, many european country currently crossroad. first, regard public finances, country face option either profoundly reform public expenditure social security system put long run sustainability risk. second, i convince economic activity, employment innovation eu lift new, structurally higher, level far-reaching progressive structural reforms. these must go hand hand fiscal consolidation. the long-term advantage follow strategy far outweigh short-term cost implementation. i therefore strongly encourage support government courage leadership follow path hope country follow positive example. dr. whitaker, let express profound admiration example show central banker everywhere endurance constant commitment public good. the fruit life’s work around u today play role inspire policy reform europe. i one, dr whitaker, salute work, thank inspiration give us. thank attention. bi review 33/2004 5 wu xiaolin: china’s monetary interest rate policy year 2004 speech miss wu xiaolin, deputy governor people’s bank china, forum financial open commercial bank reform china, beijing, 17 april 2004. * * * the 3rd plenum 16th cpc national congress call deepen financial reform push forward financial institution reform improve financial supervisory regulatory regime. commercial bank reform, one important component financial reform, inseparable improvement financial regulatory regime, lay foundation commercial bank reform, also intensify requirement operation management commercial banks. give current economic financial situation, central bank’s monetary policy stance year 2004 rein excessive money credit growth, avoid excessive volatility interest rate accelerate interest rate liberalization. next, i would like focus china’s monetary interest rate policy year 2004. i. monetary policy target 2004 we expect keep m2 m1 growth rate around 17%, new rmb lend around rmb 2.6 trillion yuan, cpi around 3%. the ultimate objective monetary policy maintain balance economic growth. large population comparatively insufficient resource china pose constraint economic growth. therefore, economy develop pragmatic, coordinate balance way. accord 7% growth rate target 2004 set central committee, consider money supply growth new lend 2004 low previous year due time lag excessive credit growth 2003, decide aforementioned monetary policy targets. with appropriate macroeconomic adjustment regulation, cpi year 2004 expect keep around 3%. to specific, hangover effect may contribute 2.2 pp cpi, new inflation factor price adjustment policy contribute 1 pp. combine non-quantifiable upward price pressure, cpi growth rate could maintain around 3% macroeconomic adjustment measure gradually take effect. give china’s economy, recent years, process transition integration world economy, correlation among economic variable keep changing; hence selection intermediate monetary policy target provoke debate academia. before clear conclusion reached, make intermediate target synthetic target, focus m2 credit scale consider money market rates. ii. apply various monetary policy instrument flexible manner reach monetary policy target china’s economy, currently right transition period, comparable command develop market economy. the complexity macroeconomic development pose challenge monetary policy. in connection, utilize various monetary policy instrument flexible manner, reach monetary policy targets. at present, major monetary policy instrument include: open market operation, reserve requirement, interest rate policy, re-lending rediscount, credit policy. i. sterilize excessive forex position open market operation maintain sufficient liquidity market over past two years, china’s foreign exchange reserve grow fast, lead substantial increase base money injection result forex purchase. in line overall money credit plan, people’s bank china (pbc) maintain stable growth base money open market operation. since 22nd april 2004, central bank intensify currency withdraw circulation issue central bank bills. by end 2003, central bank make 63 issue central bank bills, total issuance amount rmb 722.68 billion yuan, outstanding amount rmb 337.68 billion yuan. in 2003, base money injection result forex purchase add rmb 1,145.9 billion yuan, open market operation withdraw bi review 32/2004 1 rmb 269.4 billion yuan base money, result net base money injection rmb 876.5 billion yuan. at time, pbc provide sufficient liquidity financial institution flexible market operation. at end last august, ipo huaxia bank lead relatively large liquidity shortage commercial banks. under circumstance, pbc, august 26 september 2nd, 2003, twice reduce issuance scale 3-month central bank bill inject liquidity commercial bank 7-day reverse repo transaction; at time changjiang power ipo november 11 last year, pbc conduct 7-day reserve repo transaction. under guidance open market operation, 7-day repo rates, typical inter-bank interest ratea, remain stable around 2.15% despite liquidity fluctuation result ipos, indicate open market operation reach expect target. give sufficient liquidity financial institution fall trend money market rate first quarter year, pbc intensify sterilization operation. in period, cumulative amount central bill issuance reach rmb 435.2 billion yuan outstanding amount stand rmb 615.45 billion yuan; base money injection result forex purchase amount rmb 291.6 billion yuan, open market operation withdraw rmb 281 billion yuan, result net base money injection rmb 10.6 billion yuan basically offset forex position base money. ii. use reserve requirement policy flexible way low cost currency withdraw improve operation commercial bank in order rein obviously excessive credit growth, pbc raise require reserve ratio one pp september 21, 2003. traditional money bank theory regard require reserve ratio hike relatively drastic measure, nevertheless central bank interpret mild move. the major reason central bank withdraw large amount excess liquidity fast growth foreign exchange reserves, to so, central bank issue cb bill without measure, raise interest rate cb bill high level give strong economic expansion momentum commercial banks’ wide interest rate differential large return cb bills, however, high interest rate would significant implication economy. in contrast, 1 pp rise require reserve ratio enable central bank reduce low cost commercial banks’ excess reserve around rmb150 billion yuan, account 6% hold treasury bills, financial bond cb bills. therefore, require reserve ratio hike actually mild policy measure. moreover, policy announce one month advance, give sufficient time financial institution manage liquidity. the pbc also provide timely support financial institution short-term liquidity difficulties, maintain overall stable development financial operation money market interest rates. with approval state council, pbc announce march 25, 2004 require reserve ratio financial institution capital adequacy ratio specific level would rise 0.5 pp 7.5%, ratio financial institution remain unchanged. state-owned commercial banks, urban rural credit cooperative exempt differentiate require reserve ratio policy. on april 11, 2004, pbc announce require reserve ratio financial institution except urban rural credit cooperative would rise 0.5 pp since april 25, 2004. the differentiate require reserve ratio scheme transitional policy line china’s current financial system, innovation base original purpose require reserve ratio policy, i.e. ensure payment settlement commercial banks, prevent over-lending financial institution attract favorable loan term may undermine liquidity payment capacity. the require reserve ratio policy gradually evolve monetary policy instrument, deposit insurance regime combine supervision capital adequacy ratio start replace policy tool impose prompt corrective action financial institution base different risk profiles. give fact china yet establish deposit insurance system, quite number financial institution fail reach 8% capital adequacy ratio, differentiate require reserve ratio scheme conducive curb excessive credit expansion financial institution low capital adequacy ratio poor asset quality, prevent one-size-fits-all approach macro financial adjustment regulation. 2 bi review 32/2004 iii. utilize monetary policy instrument at time, pbc strengthen credit management rigorously curb loan over-invested industries, keep proportion medium long term loan reasonable level. the pbc also endeavor adjust loan structure, urge financial institution implement credit policy, promote financial ecological development, enhance re-lending rediscount management, continue improve financial service rural economy, promote inter-bank market development. iii. the priority china’s current interest rate policy enhance institutional reform facilitate monetary policy transmission mechanism in market economy, interest rate policy conduct adjust interest rate influence market finance cost signal central bank’s judgment economic development liquidity position. in game central bank public, signal effect big finance cost. i. adjust interest rate flexibly condition maintain internal external equilibrium since september 2003, year-on-year (yoy) consumption price level grow fast 3.2% end december, imply increase inflation pressure. from january march 2004, yoy cpi rise 3.2%, 2.1%, 3.1% respectively month-to-month (mom) rise 1.1%, –0.2% 0.3% respectively. the cpi first half year may continue rise, current one-year loan rate 5.31%. if real loan rate fall negative point time, behavior economic agent distorted. the enterprise accumulate raw material make profit simply borrowing, thus aggravate raw material shortage, push price level lead fund circulate retail rather invest manufacturing. therefore, price level one indicator central bank must closely monitor consider interest rate policy. in addition, central bank must also take account issue forex arbitrage. over past two years, capital inflow lead substantial rise forex position. the amount capital inflow directly link domestic foreign interest rate differentials. currently one-year domestic rmb deposit rate 1.98%, 1.4 pp high 0.5625% one-year domestic usd deposit rate 0.92 pp high 1.06% one-year u cd rate. in connection, must flexibly adjust interest rate condition maintain internal external equilibrium. ii. establish float benchmark interest rate regime signal public timely manner with approval state council, pbc decide adopt float relending rate regime. relendings refer loan central bank grant financial institutions. float relending rate regime mean pbc, accord macroeconomic financial situation, set announce extent relending rate move benchmark rate within fluctuation band authorize state council. effective march 25, 2004, rate one-year-or-less liquidity relendings rise 0.63 pp exist benchmark level. in order support agricultural development, float relending rate regime rural credit cooperative implement gradually three years, three year later, rate increment rccs half financial institutions. the adoption float relending rate regime another important step toward interest rate liberalization. it help improve interest rate formation mechanism central bank’s capability guide market rates, also upgrade effectiveness transparency relending management. iii. change way reset loan rate guide commercial bank enhance risk management make positive reaction interest rate change central bank with approval state council, pbc change way reset loan rates. effective january 1st, 2004, way reset loan (excluding household mortgages) rate determine borrower lender negotiation. the frequency reset rate medium long bi review 32/2004 3 term rmb loans, previously year determine borrower lenders, monthly, quarterly, annual, fixed. this policy move correct asymmetry fix deposit rate annually change loan rates. consequently, commercial bank determine way reset loan rate accord customer’s credit rating, flexibly design loan products. also, shorten reset interval help commercial bank spot problem customer’s solvency problem. in addition, central bank change benchmark rates, commercial bank promptly adjust loan rate base lend agreement, thus mitigate interest rate risk, facilitate transmission monetary policy manufacture consumption. the change loan rate reset policy force commercial bank establish offer system, factor credit risk interest risk estimate profits, set internal transfer price mechanism. iv. speed adoption loan rate floor deposit rate ceiling policy urge commercial bank improve asset/liability management (alm) with control lend scale deposit/lending rates, commercial banks’ alm focus ratio deposit lendings. interest rate liberalization, nevertheless, require commercial bank focus interest rate risk capital adequacy ratio. (i) loan rate floor management loan rate floor management call commercial bank adjust asset structure risk pricing. accord survey september 2002, le half outstanding commercial bank lend fix rate, stock-holding commercial banks, percentage fix rate loan 36%. since 0.9-1.7 pp float range basically liberalize lend rates, commercial bank must learn price risk. loan price must take account factor fund cost, direct indirect costs, loan taxation cost, loan maturity, loan risk target profit. fund cost rate refer cost commercial bank obtain fund market similar maturity cash flow loan extend clients, i.e. internal transfer price loan. direct costs, include cost relate loan product client services, derive direct cost rate use activity-based-cost (abc) average-cost method. indirect costs, generate operation loan activities, calculate use average-cost method. because calculation direct indirect cost use historical data, data must update regularly ensure effectiveness applicability. in china, taxation cost rate operate tax rate plus add cost per loan. credit risk premium use cover expect loan loss expect loan loss rate equal default rate multiply loan loss rate. to estimate loan loss, commercial bank must set internal rat modes. the long loan’s maturity, high lend rate. the logic behind long maturity mean long finance period, consequently high finance cost great possibility change cost, therefore, loan rate rise accordingly. target profit estimate use return capital ratio capital lending. at present, loan price one weakness commercial banks, past didn’t much chance due interest rate control. in process interest rate liberalization come years, commercial bank need step effort price product, accumulate experience basic data, strengthen international competitiveness. (ii) deposit rate ceiling management deposit rate ceiling management require commercial bank actively adjust liability scale structure, adapt capital adequacy ratio management. western commercial bank management theory evolve asset management, liability management, finally asset/liability management. liability management originate end the1960’s, high inflation sharp unexpected interest rate hike, combine rigorous interest rate control many countries, lead disintermediation fund shortage commercial banks. commercial bank attach great importance liability management attract fund back commercial bank innovation. however, china’s liability management originate different backdrop. in china, fund risk over-concentrated bank capital adequacy ratio commercial bank low. to meet capital adequacy ratio requirements, commercial bank must reduce either asset liability. with deposit rate ceiling policy, commercial bank tailor deposit price specific situation. 4 bi review 32/2004 commercial bank low capital adequacy ratio reduce deposit low deposit rate mitigate pressure excessively expand loan avoid loss due large liability. therefore, deposit rate ceiling policy help rein excessive credit growth mitigate inflation pressure non-performing loan risks, also guide fund capital market promote capital market development. v. actively push forward financial derivative transaction purpose provide commercial bank customer hedge instrument interest liberalization. both financial institution customer need instrument hedge interest rate risk interest rate liberalized. in fact, accord option-pricing theory, financial institutions, even without derivatives, use basic instrument create transaction nature derivative hedge risks. but pitfall relatively high cost risk. derivative hedge cost-effective convenient, risky due high leverage, reflect extent meltdown bar ltcm. in regard, enhance internal control financial institution push forward derivative transaction finally provide commercial bank customer hedge instruments. with approach fully open china’s bank sector, commercial bank reform urgent. i believe that, clear policy development direction set central committee state council favorable reform environment, commercial bank reform proceed successfully joint effort staff bank sector. bi review 32/2004 5 paul hartmann: the impact financial infrastructure transformation

successful implementation key responsibly every central bank - namely achieve maintain monetary financial stability. in modern market economy, main instrument monetary policy short-term interest rate, i.e. rate commercial bank borrow lend money markets. central bank control interest rate ability - ultimate provider liquidity bank system - influence balance supply demand fund money markets. in countries, change level mandatory reserve commercial bank require hold central bank also use influence supply/demand balance hence generate require movement short-term interest rates, therefore whole spectrum interest rate economy. through open-market operation central bank intervene market maintain interest rate desire levels. an efficient interbank money market prerequisite process successful. also, central bank position reliably forecast factor influence daily liquidity monetary system. a reliable rtgs system therefore indispensable enable central bank determine monetary condition economy implement appropriate monetary policy. the namibian rtgs system certainly enable u monitor monetary conditions, bank namibia ability use bank rate influence liquidity situation market condition way central bank do. also, manipulate reserve asset requirement manage liquidity situation namibia. moreover, active interbank market still lack namibia, bank conduct interbank transaction south african parent company rather domestic banks. however, i indicate late still tool method manage liquidity within rtgs system. let retract bite give overview payment system reform project namibia. 2. namibia’s payment system reform project namibia’s payment system reform project essentially drive three key considerations: • firstly, foremost drive force behind project realisation namibian payment system reform process essential reduce various payment system risk increase efficiency namibian financial system function economy. • secondly, south africa, settlement centre long period time, realise allow payment system use country could introduce risk countries, which, turn, could destabilise financial system. cma country therefore, encourage establish domestic clear settlement arrangement institute appropriate arrangement cross-border transactions. • thirdly, consultative framework provide sadc central bank governors, initiative establish define implement safe, efficient harmonise payment system sadc member state implement regional cross-border payment strategy support free-trade protocol. the guide principle lead reform programme realisation safe, efficient cost effective payment system critical sound function financial system key requirement maintain promote financial stability. a sound safe function payment system also facilitate prudential supervision, improve monetary policy intervention liquidity management. the national payment system reform project drive entire bank industry lead bank namibia overseer clear settlement processes. the bank namibia banker association namibia agree bank would spearhead settlement leg project, commercial bank would assume responsibility seek appropriate solution namibian payment clear arrangements. commercial bank drive payment clear process line standard lay bank namibia. both project closely coordinate bank commercial bank steer committee created. 2 bi review 53/2004 namibia implement settlement system perago system service provider also project manager. this system call ni - acronym namibia inter-bank settlement system go live 10th june 2002. the system base real-time gross settlement principle enable namibian bank exchange payment electronically, real-time, amongst bank namibia. in accordance international practices, fund transfer final irrevocable, way namibian system bring line generally accept principle safe efficient national payment system. all commercial bank namibia connect ni via swift, international de facto financial message carrier. they enter system ni entry user interface also provide perago. on 16th april 2004 bank namibia two commercial bank switch trustlink bureau service swift. this link-up improve efficiency service relate swift provide bureau, also substantial cost save arrangement. namibia’s rtgs system simply installation computer hardware software - involve reengineering financial system namibia. a number exist policies, procedure rule modify fine-tune support overall financial system country enhance effectiveness central bank policies. some legal statute create payment system management act amend bill exchange act order make system legally enforceable properly align namibian legal environment. a such, require willingness change exist policies, practice process exist then. the advantage ni commercial bank improve visibility management risk exposures, optimal usage liquidity possible new service customers. for bank namibia, system lead enhance mechanism support monetary policy execution, containment systemic risk platform financial market deepening. overall, system improve international risk profile namibia. payment instrument take many forms, cash, money orders, cheques, debit credit cards, electronic fund transfers, point sale automate teller machines. the importance place instrument liquidity, relate especially general acceptability marketability, little risk capital loss. these payment instrument must clear do normally clear process allow settlement take place. in namibia, ni currently settle obligation result domestic cheque high-value interbank payments. the remain payment stream i.e. card electronic payment follow late stage. this mean annual turnover ni still quite small: 2003 ratio settlement turnover gdp 7:1, compare ratio 30:1 south africa. apart domestic cheque clearance, domestic cross-border payment arrangement clear system still integrate intertwine south african payment system, make use various payment clear service bankserv, south african inter-bank payment service utility company. the namibian clear project therefore aim designing, develop instal system support paper, card electronic transaction namibianised systems. the clear system project primarily drive commercial bank accordance high-level project plan approve parties. the clear system steer committee agree appoint project adviser assist define system architecture, prepare request-for-proposal (rfp) evaluate system proposals. the electronic fund transfer (eft) system operational end may 2004. by october 2004 eft cheque stream migrate new platform (namclear) fully integrate settlement system. all current paper, card electronic base transaction continue offer public businesses. the significant difference, however, fact transaction support namibian systems. moreover, cheque clearance much fast currently case, mean beneficiary obtain quick value cheque payments. people business make receive payment advantage improve cash flows, may stimulate trade velocity money circulation. one area consideration give transaction south africa. at time namibian payment system become operational namibia long depend south african payment systems, cross-border payment make correspondent bi review 53/2004 3 bank relationship. still, bank namibia bank industry continue seek system solution allow support electronic linkage namibian south african payment systems. 3. issue pertain liquidity management the implementation ni 10 june 2002 subsequent introduction intra-day repurchase agreement (repo) 27 october 2003 compel bank introduce new lend policy credit facility local bank institutions. more specifically, bank introduce lend system comprise follow components: • before implementation niss, bank allow bank institution overdraw current account security pledge bank. the purpose facility specify mean could use liquidity settlement non-settlement purposes. the facility time limit. collateralised credit attract interest bank rate, double bank rate charge uncollateralised credit. • shortly introduction niss, interim measure, bank provide credit bank institution credit limit module niss. in arrangement limit participant set daily collateral pledge bank. this facility add exist credit facility offer bank, provide credit non-settlement purposes. both facility attract interest bank rate. • with introduction intraday repo 27 october 2003, bank start provide credit participant repurchase agreement credit limit collateralised reserve balances. in case credit available intra-day overnight purposes. for long periods, credit provide facility outside niss. the bank rate apply facilities. in september 2003, settlement transition bring same-day settlement basis. previously, ni participant 09h00 next morning obtain sufficient liquidity settle obligation accrue previous fund settlement value date. this modification oblige participant retain sufficient liquidity settlement account meet daily settlement obligations. same-day settlement also saw increase liquid deposit hold commercial bank bank’s call account. interest payable balance way become policy tool manage liquidity extent. during time high outflows, rate increased, rate decrease time excess domestic liquidity. moreover, same-day settlement sharply reduce use intraday credit / repo, oblige participant use liquid fund rather rely central bank intraday credit (which actually overnight credit). for example, maximum intraday credit extend ni participant 14 percent settlement value june 2003; ratio come 6 percent april year. these reform mainly mean improve ability central bank manage liquidity monetary system manage risk exposures. let turn reform bank namibia currently envisaging. 4. bank namibia’s propose accommodation policy mr. chairman, i would like turn attention bank namibia’s accommodation policy, since i regard important component monetary policy. a central bank could provide credit facility part payment services, especially connection large value transfer systems, facilitate smooth flow settlement payment system. but, central bank want credit operation reduce control liquidity monetary management. it also want avoid become lender first resort market participants. on contrary, would want foster development private money markets, include intraday funds. moreover, grant credit, central bank typically wish use price objective ration criterion comprise (i) observance regulatory supervisory norms, (ii) provision collateral, (iii) requirement borrowers’ capital. 4 bi review 53/2004 our new policy focus bank provide liquidity bank institution four different facilities, different term conditions. these facility intraday repurchase agreement, seven-day repurchase agreement, marginal lend facility, lender last resort. since lender last resort would highly discretionary, i focus three. before i move explain facility applied, let explain underlie principle accommodation policy: • the bank recognise distinct role short-term liquidity provider ni participant view enhance timely smooth settlement. this role should, however, interfere bank’s monetary policy liquidity management roles. • in vein, bank guard perpetual lend could bleak view financial soundness bank institutions. for reason, lend bank institution shall limit time period. • the rtgs environment require participant maintain adequate balance settlement account bank rely central bank fulfil obligation. • liquidity provision bank come expense local interbank money market development. therefore, since bank prefer lender first resort, encourage bank institution first seek liquidity local market increase hold eligible financial instruments. • in provide accommodation bank institutions, bank shall ensure credit extend shall time fully appropriately secured. bank institution therefore encourage even compel hold appropriate mix security reflect liabilities. • for accommodation window, bank shall ensure security repoed collateralised facility overlap security facilities. for reason, security differentiate term maturity issuers. have express principle accommodation policy, let explain three main accommodation window bank currently considering. intraday repurchase agreement in facility, bank grant short-term intraday liquidity bank institution ni settlement need only. credit extend primarily following: • the automatic repo facility use eligible security repurchase agreement bank bank institutions. • bank institution allow use 25 per cent fund hold minimum reserve account bank, provide prescribe balance restore require minimum 14 day average period. the facility automatic provide that: • bank institution enter valid repo agreement bank; • bank institution sufficient appropriate security reserve repo purpose bank namibia; • bank institution maintain sufficient balance minimum reserve account 14 day maintenance period. credit facility provide day, i.e. intraday. however, may expandable overnight must repurchase close next work day i.e., second night. if bank institution sufficient fund repurchase security back, could obtain credit next facility i.e., seven-day repo and/or marginal lend facility. bi review 53/2004 5 seven-day repurchase agreement this facility provide liquidity bank institution premise monetary policy liquidity management. accordingly, provide liquidity bank institution sufficient security additional credit intraday facility niss. for reason, bank institution may apply obtain credit either repurchase security and/or obtain sufficient credit anticipate settlement needs. liquidity provide facility seven-day repurchase agreement. this facility operate stand condition obtain prior application bank. it is, however, manage outside niss. marginal lend facility this facility introduce offer special assistance bank institution could obtain sufficient liquidity first two facilities. the use facility highly discourage would use special circumstances. thus, lend facility would consider merit case present bank. this facility serf important indicator example: • it give clear indication bank institution suspend niss. • it give indication bank supervision department notified. • it provide smooth path action lender last resort policy. 5. conclusion mr. chairman, address today i give generic overview importance payment system monetary policy implementation. to understand namibian situation, i also give brief impression payment system reform process strategic policy consideration go design operation systems. yet reform process yet. there always area one modify fine-tune certain procedures, operation policy improve effectiveness system reduce contain risks. i trust audience obtain good understand role payment system monetary policy implementation way namibia address certain vital policy issues. in hindsight, i think capital invest rtgs system prove worthwhile. with implementation electronic settlement system, number relate policy issue become evident reconsider reformed. the system, accompany accommodate policies, enable namibia come close meet bi core principle systemically important payment systems. what remain achieve complete namibianised clear system three payment streams, establish clear house payment system management body effectively oversee payment system ensure sufficient attention give risk reduction management design operation. the infrastructure develop certainly enable namibia fulfil statutory role promote maintain efficient payment system. finally, i would like thank perago host meet continue consultation perago supplier developer payment system application user vitally important. i wish fruitful deliberation next days. i thank you. 6 bi review 53/2004 jean-claude trichet: current issue european central bank euro speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, club international la redoute, bonn, 27 september 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it great honour pleasure speak club international la redoute bonn. tonight, i plan share reflection ecb euro u quite while. contrary critic predict launch almost six year ago, euro success start. from day one existence, manage deliver promise deliver - new single currency would least good confidence-inspiring best performer among previous national currency prior introduction euro. that i would like share think main factors, principle mechanism help ecb make euro success. i would also like elaborate implication historic enlargement europe future integration new member state field monetary policy. my first remark relate successful transition euro with introduction euro almost six year ago engage grand enterprise irreversibly tie together economic monetary destiny eleven, twelve, sovereign nation states. we ask deliver new single currency would least good credible credible one among previous national currency - promise deliver. it solemn promise make 300 million people europe. it crucial smooth transition euro. have fail meet promise, number people europe would see medium long term market interest rate rise moment transition, reflect deterioration quality new currency. at time, meet promise extraordinarily demand success transition euro much depend immediate achievement high level credibility. and credibility delivery price stability intact two-year five-year perspective, also ten-year even thirty-year basis. i well remember that, start work, success take granted. sceptic doubt possible establish euro stable currency successfully formulate monetary policy currency area, diverse many respects. in particular, coexistence sovereign national fiscal policy supranational monetary policy consider dangerous mixture. the single approach imply single monetary policy criticise serious hindrance economic convergence. some sceptic even take view stability-oriented monetary policy bind fail situation. where stand today? the experience past five half year make clear euro firmly establish stable credible currency. the introduction euro book-entry form form banknote coin go extremely smoothly virtually free technical problems. in january 1999 establish almost night unify money market work well start. new payment system large-value transaction implement successfully. three year late introduction euro note coins, unique logistical undertaking, take place smoothly, without major hitches. equally important, ecb’s monetary policy successful keep inflation inflation expectation control, even face exceptional uncertainty number substantial, mainly upward, price shock hit euro area economy. to large extent, ecb’s monetary policy operate context exceptional economic, financial geopolitical uncertainty, instance period follow traumatic terrorist attack 9/11 three year ago. it strong belief euro single monetary policy considerably contribute protect economy otherwise could much adversely affected. bi review 53/2004 1 with view anchor long term inflation expectation keep steady hand never overreacted, bear testimony capacity weather difficulties. we succeed deliver best yield curve available economy form euro area. this sharp contrast view observer argue quality euro new currency would converge towards sort arithmetic average legacy currencies, rather benchmark set credible national currency merge euro. in fact, happen low market interest rate exist small number economy immediately extend full body euro area. long-term inflation expectation align low level best perform economy merge euro. a consequence, nominal real interest rate historically low levels, europe enjoy much favourable financial condition 1990s. this success remarkable give ecb start without track record own. in respect, say today ecb bear credible. but that? in view, mainly three, closely related, factor principle work: clear unambiguous institutional setting, ecb’s strong commitment high degree transparency monetary policy strategy. clear mandate independent central bank let start make remark mandate deliver price stability. this mandate mirror mandate large majority eu national central bank 1999. it enshrine maastricht treaty, sign government european union ratify national parliaments, thereby reflect clear preference citizen europe stable currency. consequently, mandate maintain price stability include eminent place, “union’s objectives”, draft constitution approve european council last june. this clear assignment responsibility monetary policy indispensable ensure high degree credibility policy outset. but price stability economically desirable objective? well, price stability enhance efficiency price mechanism allocate resources. it associated, particular, low uncertainty risk premia financial markets. this facilitate financial transaction ultimately imply low medium long-term interest rates, thereby foster investment. stable price also prevent ad hoc redistribution wealth income result unexpected price developments, turn contribute social cohesion. a historical experience full body academic research illustrates, maintain price stability necessary condition monetary policy foster sustainable growth job creation. independence to ensure fulfil mandate effectively, treaty assign considerable independence eurosystem consist ecb 12 national central bank eu member state adopt euro. today, broad consensus among central banker economist high degree independence allow central bank conduct monetary policy consistent manner, fulfil mandate guarantee price stability thereby gain maintain high degree public confidence policy. once public market convince central bank’s commitment preserve price stability, act - example, wage price set - way facilitate achievement goal. a virtuous cycle create conducive create environment stable price economic activity flourish. at time central bank independence go hand hand need transparency. transparency in fact, today, transparency rule game. strive high degree transparency monetary policy widely acknowledge fundamental principle efficient monetary policy. it include set clear benchmark accountability, which, democratic societies, quid pro quo independence. it also include announcement unambiguous objective public, timely comprehensive release pertinent information content monetary policy 2 bi review 53/2004 deliberations. in sense, transparency serve accountability, also help market trace, understand broadly anticipate monetary policy systematically react observable data indicators, thereby enhance credibility, predictability effectiveness monetary policy. the ecb play lead role general trend towards great transparency openness. it fact set standard transparency practice monetary policy. acknowledge transparency ultimately public understand why, begin practise open transparent communication market participant public large. we place strong emphasis transparency decision-making process, provision timely clear explanation economic diagnosis general public market participants, accountability vis-à-vis european parliament. this extremely important element new institution ecb lack track record. the first important step towards high degree transparency explicit announcement monetary policy strategy october 1998, well actually start conduct single monetary policy euro area. it clearly state basic concept drive monetary policy thus help reduce acute uncertainty face market participant time. a regard communication policy, begin bold. in 1999 state art central bank communication was, exceptions, display diagnosis central bank delay five six week publish minutes. a rule, timely comprehensive explanation give issue detail communiqué hold press conference policy meeting. in fact, ecb among first central bank give real time detail analysis diagnosis organize regular press conference and, date, still remain one shortly monetary policy meetings. in press conferences, give full detail explanation analysis reason underlie policy decisions. the introductory statement open press conference consist extend summary deliberation govern council situation assess diagnosis expressed. the press conference furthermore allow transparent interaction participant and, them, full body observers, saver investors. all wealth information provide “real time”. in addition, ecb’s monthly bulletin provide public full set detail assessment data underlie policy decision day taken. this demonstrate strong transparent. our commitment transparency actually acknowledged. this reflect evidence first five half year (supported recent empirical work) suggest highly predictable decision - least much influential central banks. this also demonstrate monetary policy well understand external observers. monetary policy strategy let come third factor behind success euro ecb, lie heart monetary policy concept: ecb’s monetary policy strategy. to devise best possible monetary policy new currency, aim build wisdom wealth experience conduct monetary policy accumulate precede decade central bank academic institution industrialise countries, particular form euro area. the ecb’s definition price stability a i emphasise above, basis strategy mandate treaty maintain price stability primary objective monetary policy. in order make mandate operational, govern council ecb october 1998 sharpen focus define price stability quantitative term year-on-year increase harmonise index consumer price 2%. this public announcement absolutely instrumental preserve continuity moment transition previous national currency euro: euro give definition price stability one attribute credible national currency benefit low market interest rates. we clarify last year that, pursuit price stability, bi review 53/2004 3 ecb aim inflation rate close 2%, thereby preserve sufficient safety margin risk deflation. there great advantage clear, publicly announce quantitative definition price stability: first, good transparency, everybody know precisely aim at. second, good accountability, public judge whether achieve goal comparison yardstick make public. finally, good medium long-term credibility, inflationary expectation easily anchored. the medium-term orientation ecb’s monetary policy ever since announcement strategy 1998 ecb also make clear price stability maintain medium term. the medium-term orientation ecb’s monetary policy strategy clarify time horizon price stability re-established need tailor prevail circumstance economy. by adapt appropriate monetary policy horizon prevail economic circumstances, ecb make important contribution avoid unnecessary volatility output employment growth. moreover, focus medium term embody commitment avoid overly activist ambitious attempt fine-tune inflation outcomes. this also contribute ensure expectation remain consistent declare policy objective medium term help ecb preserve high degree credibility, comprehensiveness analytical framework we constantly bombard economic news. in order protect risk swamp late indicator able deeply understand main factor drive economic, monetary financial developments, central bank, daily operations, filter enormous amount information. it routinely seek define state economy new circumstance arise evaluate implication risk price stability. this highly demand exercise, economic shock come label difficult identify real time. in addition, economy potentially always subject several form structural change. a consequence, clear central bank simple rule link policy one two privilege indicator substitute accurate examination economic development complexities. from beginning, ecb felt need adopt conceptual framework could help sort wealth potentially conflict statistics, organize various piece reliable road map internal analysis communication public. this require adoption framework concentrate picture economy large, complex permanently evolve system. a consequence, analysis incorporate possible pertinent information, relevant forecast model exercises, include private sector views. we dependent decision mechanical result equation single set equation algorithm. in complex world, complexity reality cannot adequately capture single model uncertainty important element take account decision, also need judgement policymaking body take policy decisions, particularly assess likelihood certain hypothetical scenario potentially materialising. specifically, opt ‘binocular’ perspective economy, organise “economic analysis” “monetary analysis”. this policy framework, well know ‘two pillar approach’, convey notion diversify analysis. our economic analysis focus real activity financial condition study shorter-run deviation inflation long-term trends. however, also complement economic analysis monetary analysis, place great emphasis longer-term trend inflation. monetary analysis allow u cross-check, medium long-term perspective, information stem economic analysis. it constantly remind central bank fundamental principle that, respond economic development unfold, must never lose sight fact that, sufficiently extend horizons, rate money growth must consistent price stability objective. this cross-check ensure relevant information take account assessment risk price stability monetary policy nominal anchor beyond - 4 bi review 53/2004 even well beyond - conventional projection horizon. it also induce reinforce firm sense direction, discourage policy agitation. the need structural reform however, good monetary policy alone sufficient make monetary union success. we clear realistic monetary policy deliver and, even importantly, cannot. monetary policy, even though well-designed implemented, cannot solve europe’s economic problems. appropriate structural reform decisively implement national government vital sustainable, non-inflationary growth euro area economy. to increase growth potential europe, structural reform need euro area. this fact long recognise eu policymakers, notably european council adopt lisbon strategy four year ago foster economic growth drive job creation. ambitious, well-designed decisively implement structural reform labour, product capital market enhance shock absorption capacity economy effectiveness macroeconomic policies. in respect, convince commitment decisively implement structural reform credible communication economic benefit general public crucial raise consumer investor confidence and, ultimately, growth employment. the new stimulate challenge enlargement let turn new stimulate challenge enlargement, which, view, offer great opportunity european economy whole. the enlargement european union ten country central eastern europe mediterranean 1st may year without doubt major milestone history european integration. these country together comprise population 75 million people one fifth enlarge eu. while economic weight new member state is, current stage, le significant - total gdp share exist member 5% (at market exchange rates, compare around 8% eu gdp spain portugal join eu 1986), change future per-capita income level catch rest eu. what economic implication eu enlargement european economy? the debate effect enlargement often dominate concerns, risk mass migration new member states, involve increase pressure labour market welfare system member states. in view, benefit enlargement bring often neglect discussions. i convince eu enlargement win-win game old new member states, contribute positively economic growth welfare european union whole. let explain why. first all, let recall past decade, preparation enlargement already significant impact european economy, especially term trade financial integration new exist eu members. profound structural change new member state past 15 year alongside sub stantial progress towards open market early transition process (mainly implementation so-called europe agreements) lead tremendous increase trade new member states. since 1995, share current new member state eu-15 export import outside eu (so-called extra-eu export imports) increase impressive 50% 13% almost 12%, respectively. likewise, impressive progress make past decade term financial integration. substantial inflow foreign direct investment (fdi), constitute far large share total cumulative net private capital inflow new member states, stand respect and, fact, fdi key driver productivity growth export dynamics. especially russian crisis end 1990s, fdi flow eu-15 new member state increase spectacularly and, accord recent data, share current new member state eu-15’s total extra fdi outflow amount 12%. the enlargement single market begin strengthen degree competition accession new member state increase number supplier within single market. in addition, enlarge single market enhance scope economy scale. these effect low price increase productivity, thereby contribute increase potential bi review 53/2004 5 growth rate. furthermore, extension single market increase range variety product available producer consumers. however, clear benefit come automatically. to extent quickly reap depend critically whether macroeconomic condition stable extent structural reform implemented. from central bank perspective, enlargement mark begin process lead integration new member state euro area, country opt-out clause. this integration take place well-defined institutional framework comprise several stages. the first phase new member state period eu accession join exchange rate mechanism (erm ii), multilateral arrangement fix adjustable exchange rate central parity standard fluctuation band ±15% euro. the second phase start entry erm ii stretch way introduction euro. a may know, three new member state already enter erm ii late june, step still ahead new member states. in context, let recall formal criterion meet entry erm ii. however, successful smooth participation require major policy adjustment - example relate fiscal policy price liberalisation - undertake join mechanism. participation erm ii important mean anchor exchange rate inflation expectation promote discipline. it help orient macroeconomic policy stability, time allow degree flexibility, needed, wide standard fluctuation band possibility adjust central parity. beyond membership erm ii lie adoption euro. join euro area irrevocable decision thus step major importance require circumspection careful preparation. all new member state expect adopt euro due course deem fulfil condition set treaty. a past, country assess merit particular situation, base principle equal treatment. therefore, additional criterion adoption euro new member state introduced, time relaxation criterion lay treaty, include criterion concern sustainability nominal convergence. conclude remark let conclude. a promise six year ago, new currency firmly credibly establish stable currency. we ensure successful transition euro transfer new currency degree credibility one credible national currency merge euro. thank institutional set treaty monetary policy concept, ecb bear credible manage maintain high degree credibility. long-term interest rate converge average pre-emu level best previous benchmarks. yet, reason complacent. ahead lie challenges, stimulate among them, enlargement euro area. i thank attention. 6 bi review 53/2004 nout wellink: business cycle foreign direct investment speech dr nout wellink, president netherlands bank president bank international settlements, chamber luncheon american chamber commerce netherlands, amsterdam, 23 september 2004. * * * i feel honour speak distinguish group people today. to general public netherlands, ‘amcham’ may well-known organization. however, list member prof goal purpose wide support dutch business community. a know since centuries, foreign investment trade country enhance welfare countries, vital sustain promote globalize world economy. your active role process highly appreciated. traditionally, dutch-american trade investment relation extensive. in particular, average around quarter outward dutch direct investment flow direct towards unite states. over last ten year mutual direct investment flow increased. this increase similar global increase foreign direct investment start 1980s. in 2000, dutch foreign direct investment position u value around 20% dutch gdp, quarter total dutch foreign investment position. fifteen year earlier, 1985, value 12%. in talk afternoon, i explore effect increase direct investment exposures. in particular, effect behaviour international business cycles. i start elaborate two observation concern business cycles. first, contrast past, business cycle generally become moderate long term, dutch business cycle become volatile recently. moreover, dutch u business cycle become synchronized. let elaborate increase volatility dutch business cycle first. accord current knowledge, dutch economy pass trough cycle around end last year. last year, gdp growth reach low rate past twenty years, negative rate 0.9%. compare european countries, growth rate exceptionally low; one percentage point average. this low performance strong contrast performance second half nineties. in year dutch gdp growth consistently high euro area average. this illustrate dutch economy acquire kind boom-bust character, indicate volatile cyclical growth pattern. another indication give rise standard deviation growth rates. this measure volatility almost double last four years, compare four year before. for significant part, comparative strength upturn severity downturn netherlands attribute open character dutch economy. the spectacular growth world trade since 1995 decline exchange rate euro boost exports. the downturn follow opposite - - comparatively strong effect dutch economy. however, say late dutch business cycle - i return later. first, take view long term, global perspective. although volatility economic growth late dutch business cycle high before, long term, global pattern different. since long time, least since 1960, even pronounce since 1980, volatility gdp growth [measured standard deviation] show downward trend. in words, long term perspective, business cycle become stable. all g7 economies, well dutch economy, become stable. this increase stabilization label economist ‘the great moderation’, especially respect u economy. to give quantitative illustration, standard deviation quarterly growth rate netherlands 2.4% 1980s; period since 1990 fall 1.4%. similar figure find us. extensive research devote explanation moderation business cycle past twenty years. there two explanation i would like focus speech. the first explanation propose structural change. this explanation suggest improvement ability modern economy absorb shocks. for example, due improve method inventory management, le severe fluctuation inventory bi review 53/2004 1 stocks. other example deregulation financial markets, improve resilience strength financial sector. financial institution able diversify risks, internationally among type financial products. therefore, supply credit private sector become sophisticated, enhance ability firm smooth activity business cycle. second, economic research convincingly show number size shock hit economy diminish past twenty years. in sense, observe moderation business cycle since 1980s see result good luck. however, consequence, possible may experience increase volatility again, run luck. besides volatility, second characteristic recent business cycle deserve attention: international co-movement - synchronization - cycles. business cycle modern economy tend move together. for example, rate correlation u dutch growth rate vary 0.4 0.5, since 1960. an extensively study question whether increase amount synchronization business cycles. in general, available evidence indicate overall tendency towards close synchronization co-movement, past quarter century. however, detail level, picture different. there case increase synchronization within group pair countries. for example, within group euro area countries, synchronization become close since nineteen-eighties. moreover, late cycle, correlation u dutch growth rate increase significantly, value 0.65. from this, may conclude dutch u growth rate become synchronize recent cycle. in general, two source co-movement economies. first, clear general shock economy, affect many countries, lead correlate national economic developments. this reflect common reaction le comparable country exogenous factor. example energy price shocks, major development technology. second, addition common shocks, country-specific shock important, extent spill countries. spill over shock require economic linkage countries, like trade financial flows. hence, strong linkage raise probability co-movement. for example, increase economic activity one country boost activity trade partner high foreign demand. more recently, another transmission channel country increase importance: foreign direct investment, fdi. several factor contribute strong increase fdi flow since mid-nineties, like liberalization capital flows, reduce trade barrier widespread use ict-technologies. interestingly, result empirical analysis dnb show country comparatively large bilateral fdi position tend high correlation output growth rates. in words, fdi may intensify co-movement business cycles. in particular, appear case period 1995-2001. there two way fdi act transmission channel economic shocks, depend shock occurs: home country host - foreign - country. first, shock foreign investor’s home country may affect financial position home, force cutback activity host country well. second, due shock host country, value firm’s investment abroad may affected. consequently, firm’s net worth home affect well. net worth, turn, relate finance costs, obvious reduction value foreign investment may reduce investment home country, high costs. let try integrate i say far. on one hand, international economic linkages, like trade fdi flows, become strong sophisticated. in would lead co-movement (or synchronization) business cycles, common country-specific shock transfer ‘effectively’ rapidly countries. for example, account problem u national effects, also transfer european country channel within multinational firm (like ahold anderson). on hand, sign amount strength common shock decreased. i mention early explanation global moderation business cycles. a result, enhance transmission channel country-specific shock compensate small le frequent common international shocks. this explain why, global scale, co-movement cycle remain fairly stable. 2 bi review 53/2004 have discuss global picture, i return netherlands now. a i said, dutch business cycle become volatile recently, well synchronize us. both observation contrast global picture moderate cycle stable synchronization. in opinion, atypical feature dutch business cycle explain term i use describe global picture. first, dutch economy subject especially powerful country-specific shocks. an example exceptionally favourable house market development nineteen-nineties, positive effect private consumption. late on, consumption negatively affect political developments, reduce consumer confidence significantly. besides, size external sector large fdi position make dutch economy particularly sensitive international developments, especially us. this also reflect stock market - research indicate dutch stock market traditionally highly correlate u stock market, comparison european countries. in term fdi, u far important partner netherlands. a percentage gdp, dutch investment u large european country. hence surprise international u shock sizeable effect dutch economy, like sharp correction international stock market 2000, well geopolitical tension recent years. a consequence, dutch business cycle volatile move closely together u economy business cycle countries. it challenge take look ahead. what observations, i sketch here, imply global business cycle near future? will business cycle remain moderate co-movement remain stable? let try discus implication remark far. one implication take note of, relate vulnerability economy international shocks. several study conclude business cycle moderated, amount size shock diminished. however, might continue indefinitely - may run luck. major international shock could occur again, significantly enhance international business cycle volatility co-movement. in fact, recently experience terrorism geopolitical tension may act shock economy, example global shock confidence level disruption energy supply. an obvious result could disruptive shock oil prices. in respect, result recent study oil price shock striking. it find oil price shock relate political factor supply side condition severe implication type oil price shocks, shock relate demand conditions. since 1984, oil price shock type occurred, except past half year. be large international shock materialize, one aware partial consequence expose country large past. this transmission channel shocks, fdi trade flows, increase time probably continue so. however, say aim reduce international linkages. let elaborate this. first, one forget international trade linkage may transmit economic disturbances, beneficial effect well. fdi become important mechanism transfer technology, include management techniques. in way, fdi support smooth adoption technology make economy le vulnerable cyclical factors. for example, scale economy may drive multinational firm apply state-of-the-art ict-technology management model different countries. i conceal also mistake respect - clear case overinvestment global boom merger acquisitions. however, reliable empirical evidence technology transfer fdi stimulate rate technological progress. second, negative effect international shock may keep check ongoing improvement resilience financial sector. this month, imf report (in weo) global financial system strong shape past three years. finally, structural change economy indicate firm become flexible le affect cyclical developments. let illustrate focus dutch economy; however, similar development find u economy. a remarkable development observe sectoral pattern employment changes. more before, sector industry may denote either structurally shrink structurally growing; independent state business cycle. le before, industry shrink downturn expect grow next upturn cycle. consequently, employee bi review 53/2004 3 make redundant sector subject structural shrinking, must find new job growth sectors. during 1995-2002 cycle, sector account 96% employment, compare 71% 1987-1994 cycle. this change pattern sectoral employment indicate labour product market become dynamic flexible. a flexible labour market conducive labour productivity growth long term. moreover, ongoing change sectoral composition employment indicate company force carry ongoing restructuring, example, result increase competition innovation. let conclude here. every business cycle unique. however, may try find pattern take lesson past countries. in summary, long run, business cycle tend moderate co-movement appear le strong would expect. most explain absence international shock economy. however, since economy increasingly become integrated, risk disturbance spill country seem great ever. on hand, i indicated, modern economy become resilient time. this may view positive effect increase economic linkages. it opinion effect encouraged; i convince task improve economic linkage well dedicate amcham. look current business cycle, i convince bad part behind u now. most indicator point sustain recovery u world economy. a emerge downturn become clear

williams, governor central bank barbados, barbados hotel association, christchurch, 8 september 2004. * * * good morning, lady gentlemen. it great pleasure deliver feature address annual meet barbados hotel tourism association. this association along bta ministry tourism work extremely hard year especially hard since 2001, ensure survival rapid growth sector. my address describe economic landscape address issue reposition also flag issue consider stop short prescribe solutions. reposition in recent years, barbados’ dependence performance tourism sector never obvious. international development external challenge force country focus policy programme ensure barbados able compete successfully within increasingly challenge environment. we thus far weather storm (no pun intended) important challenge lie ahead broad macroeconomic level sectoral level. at broad economic level, barbados need focus develop physical economic infrastructure. there come time incremental increase unless structure revamp repositioned. yet need continuously mindful fiscally prudent. we also need keep energy policy review light rise oil prices, need ensure manufacture agricultural sector reposition viable future give global trade developments. the issue financial liberalisation liberalisation pressure service also continue challenge within csme within negotiate fora. we need also get maximum advantage tourism sector give key sector full support. in medium term continue flagbearer. credit rat in spite recent downgrade barbados’ sovereign credit rating, medium term prospect barbados promising. we still expect grow approximately 2.5%, lead tourism. the financial market fact recognise barbados continue good credit risk premium barbados’ sovereign debt affect recent rat action. not tourism best perform sector, performance last year year far high recent years. while need balance growth, i great advocate approach, apologetic fact tourism sector outperform others. foreign exchange earn the foreign exchange earn capacity sector help offset downside risk country’s debt levels. earn $1.3 billion foreign exchange 2003 (expected rise $1.4 billion 2004) contribute close 16% gross domestic product, employ 11% labour force; sector contribute handsomely economic performance barbadian economy even international development present tremendous challenges. i think credit hard work official sector government’s willingness provide support, outcome possible. the sector able 2003 register output growth 7.3% (6.7% long stay arrivals) global decline 1%. this compare annual average 3% period 1994-2003. however, 2004 growth particularly robust, reach high real value add 10% january june. bi review 52/2004 1 satellite account tourism i read interest recent report private sector trade team’s sectoral profile tourism industry - excellent document. the tourism satellite account approach measure indirect contribution sector output put 52%, interest statistic. statistician always know tourism’s overall contribution gdp much great 15-16% gdp, indirect effect take account, double count result hind approach. how, example say construction - say hilton hotel - include statistic construction sector, rather include output tourism sector. these statistical challenges, govern international standard which, international comparability, require standard measurements. however satellite approach useful one give u precise measurable appreciation indirect impact sector barbados economy, assist strategising intersectoral linkage tourism sectors, thus allow ally sector spot opportunities. the growth rate predict tourism anticipate continue expansion, dependent specific conditions, grow world economy, low energy price global decline conflicts. energy cost in case energy, current level oil price must concern cost utilities, operate cost investment constantly issue respect cost impact tourism product barbados. therefore, continue buoyancy price oil impact economic prospects. government early year pass price increase consumer. this impact sector economy, include tourism. this however prior since gallop increase oil prices. even airline impose fuel tax unclear whether far-reaching implications. in simulation run economist central bank find 25% rise domestic fuel price reduce nominal gdp approximately one percentage point, imply high oil price impact overall output. an analysis sector however conduct unable say proportion impact would bear tourism sector. exchange rate change meanwhile exchange market dominate decline u dollar. not withstand rebound since last february, world economic outlook, imf report, note u dollar depreciate 3 1/4 percent trade weight term since september 2003 16 ½ percent since peak february 2002. the dollar depreciate significantly euro yen. this would make travel source market attractive, barbados dollar tie us, would affect travel u market. the report also indicate develop economy (our main source markets) business confidence rising, unemployment improving, consumer confidence global investment promising. this augur well travel late 2004 2005. the latin american market while latin america major source market caribbean, eclac report rise commodity price latin america result high surplus good service 13 year best current account surplus half century. this would positively affect discretionary income available travel. however, clear improvement sufficiently significant lead great travel caribbean markets, information note monitor future strategy involve market developed. many caribbean market also provide continue growth opportunity, particularly since neighbour south experience prosperous times. 2 bi review 52/2004 comparative advantage in prepare increase competitiveness, country best able reap benefit specialise area basis comparative advantage. clearly tourism area barbados comparative advantage. in case tourism, comparative advantage one endowed. but competitive advantage build engineered. also, buoyant sector help support sectors. the offshore service sector able support tourism sector. development sector therefore ought great interest tourism official change face sector monitor closely. it important identify linkage build synergies. the development local craft example synergy tourism local manufacturing. in fact, craft industry largely foreign exchange earner like export industry though always perceived. sectoral linkage tourism-linked sector grow strongly tourism perform well. consequently, distribution, utilities, transport communication sector exhibit good growth rate period. much major increase construction activity, particular, past five years, tourism-related. capital investment sector also source long term capital flow benefit balance payment help boost foreign exchange reserves. this emphasis catalytic role tourism sector plays. if ensure service industry globally recognise quality, also use visit tourist market agent (by word mouth) service product broad scale. the service quality product therefore superior go use tourism linkage effectively sell abroad, include ambience environment sale take place. the cruise industry despite rapid growth long stay visitors, fast growth number cruise business. i read recently fifty percent new cruise destine caribbean waters. yet value-added cruise visitor much low long stay visitors. this something barbados region must strategise together reap great benefits. after fail attempt raise tax cruise passenger regionally, may time u seriously consider entrance cruise business, either partnership others. it market need reap great benefits. this industry expect reach 800,000 mark year, far year cruise arrival grow almost 30%. this clearly boom business. currently however, ship owner reap great benefits. they capital, waters. our private sector need work get joint venture ship owner consider use common cruise policy give leverage. we give this. market forecast future forecast world economic growth important implication tourism’s source markets. forecast differ among individual region group countries. generally however, whereas growth industrialise nation expect converge unlikely change significantly, individual market good others. in addition, evident widen gap between, rich poor countries, rich poor within country tourist markets. this suggest upmarket tourism continue important target market. indeed, country whose economy flagging, high end travel market expect le affected. this suggest continue market ourselves, among things, playground rich, may lead reliance inelastic type demand particularly affect economic slumps. source market economic performance source market influence travel market. global trend suggest euro area recovery remain subdued. while sign pickup investment, bi review 52/2004 3 household consumption remain weak gradual strengthen domestic demand expected. in japan, gdp growth continue exceed expectation strong external demand - notably china - accompany rise investment latterly pickup consumption. this may implication market thrust industry countries. indication international tourism continue concentrate main source region world. the u economy project grow 4.6% 2004 3.9% 2005, euro area 1.7% 2004 2.3% 2005, canada 2.6% 2004 3.1% 2005. the heavy international travel flow therefore continue within europe usa - least medium-term - partly growth, also high per caput income long leisure time. the imf outlook refer global recovery become “increasingly well established”. dynamic growth market country regard dynamic growth travel market are: china southeast asia region, case mediterranean eastern european countries. other europe’s market share decrease slightly 1995, 57.8% share market still far dominant tourist destinations. only develop emerge market country expect especially well. however, within caricom itself, travel grow even fast international travel region. the caribbean must however continue work increase share global market. national treatment it important next year tourism investor put appear impend prospect liberalisation scenario “national treatment” consideration may feel uneasy. it may appear country offer similar concession non-residents offer barbadian residents, position negotiate influence country commit to. also, change position negotiate arena appear possible would unwise grasp opportunity offer various concession special legislation tourism development act others still available base fear last. i urge grasp opportunity now. industry consolidation give tourism’s growth globally reinforce consolidation among every component major tourism service supplier technological advances, tourism sector cannot afford take advantage incentive counteract diseconomies scale small country like face. all stage tourism value-added chain - travel agents, travel organisers, transport hotel cater industry - subject grow competition. growth size, trend towards concentration, strategic alliance pervasive. expansion concentration strategy increasingly pursue internationally investment, merger joint ventures, horizontally vertically. i necessarily recommend merger i suggest region need respond pro-actively form alliance partnership among big player increase economic operational space even ownership increase even though merger may take place. bargain negotiation the increase trend towards concentration, make difficult small medium-sized company segment survive without broad regional even global presence. we must agile respond challenge small develop states, seek negotiate appropriate deal tourism supplier likely few actor among bargain possibly uniformity price. 4 bi review 52/2004 a consumer drive sector it far-fetched say tourism move supplier-dominated industry consumer drive business. some destinations, effort either remain demand-driven embark provide man-made travel adventure environment entice customer choose destination grind specific performance price alone. a relatively high cost destination caribbean may need adopt approach. scale diseconomies may require use exist incentive support assist provide ancilliary attractions. accessibility air travel transport increasingly determine co-operation strategic partner alliance - barbados’ official become adept negotiate way network. i go provocative here. a tourism dependent economy, might well worthwhile barbados consider get back long haul airline ownership jointly one regional partners. a tourism destination, barbados lot leverage. we need use it. i speak private sector. brand name hotel few brand name hotel get involve real estate ownership today say 10 year ago will supply service industry. because advantage market brand name, become attractive small destinations, somehow barbados successful regard - hilton hotel recent exception. we may wish opt place great energy search bring brand name barbados utilise exist unused prime location effectively. again challenge private sector pool resource take advantage exist opportunities. barbados retirement destination the recent thrust market barbados retirement destination also interest one - tourism senior citizen grow area. in industrialise nation critical aspect population growth reversal age distribution. this comparatively large proportion retire people total population also influence structure tourist demand. in addition, growth tourism continue closely tie relationship work hour leisure. in majority advance western industrialise nations’ average work hour collective bargain agreement fall steadily past 20 years, vacation length increased. florida perfect example employment strategy retirees. in florida case add advantage state tax, federal taxes. we may need (or able afford) offer tax advantage. however, barbados presently embark reduce personal income taxation, together double taxation treaty benefit may sufficient. new form market the use internet platform specifically enable service providers, hotel tour company like, reduce cost contact customer directly. with cost communication low barbados, may opportunity great use here. although figure number current book make internet local business available, nevertheless assume number, give proper attention, increase future usage cost decline. it would useful forward plan get good idea, basis industry survey, much use effective been. with direct marketing, opportunity compare price directly, open hour worry about, additional information obtain media. however, retiree market hope target more, may le incline use facility likely le computer dependent. bi review 52/2004 5 restructure market in sum, global competition tourism intensified. however, number requirement continue success continue important industry medium term industry specialist already well aware. among them: • the increase concern safety security; • permanent investment quality; • incorporation new technologies; • stress value money; • develop public-private sector partnerships. in respect quality output value money need encourage job flexibility. performance-based pay mean create incentive encourage production high quality output, therefore desirable. barbados small economy manage cater vary segment market combine up-market middle-market tourism. the challenge combine retirement market up-market tourism beyond us. the tourist industry may future focus “hybrid consumer” whose travel choice vacation activity increasingly complex. this multiple-segment market may implication ancilliary service - linkage become evident satellite measurement tourism’s impact become important estimate opportunity lie. tourism environment - dilemma for many countries, undisturbed natural balance, unspoilt landscape vary fauna flora tourist attractions. damage environment arise firstly result process unrelated tourism, secondly result inappropriate utilisation resource tourism sector itself. it environmental problem, also economic one. there cost preservation environment industry may increasingly bear cost relieve government burden. hurricane tourism caribbean will forego analysis change advent hurricane ivan? it possible short term may reticence travel region hurricane season, particularly clean recovery prolonged. in part, barbados may even benefit diversion visitor formerly head grenada even cayman. it unfortunate benefit misfortune others reality. we hurricane see medium term impact long haul flight region. also, florida badly hit well, may also benefit diversion visitor originally head florida. with respect cruises, view, cruise likely bypass affect island bypass caribbean. you, specialist sector good position make predictions. this layman’s view. tourism model industry? i would like conclude remark plan tourism like monetary economic strategies, today increasingly demand challenge. give number variable take account, industry face task deal increase complexity. however, barbados highly regard brand. our product speak self. what need resource market effectively world. thank lady gentlemen. 6 bi review 52/2004 jean-claude trichet: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, brussels, 22 september 2004. * * * je vous remercie, madame la présidente, de votre accueil. ceci étant première audition devant votre commission dans sa nouvelle composition, permettez-moi de souligner que je partage entièrement votre désir de continuer le relation étroites et fructueuses que no institution ont développées au cours de dernières années. je réjouis à la perspective de poursuivre notre dialogue dans cet esprit franc et coopératif, sachant combien cela est essentiel pour le bon fonctionnement de l’union economique et monétaire. ich möchte diese gelegenheit auch nutzen, um d langjährigen vorsitzenden diesis ausschusses und seine vorgängergremiums, de unterausschusses für währungsfragen, frau randzio-plath, nochmals herzlich für die ausgezeichnete zusammenarbeit während d vergangenen jahre zu danken. madam chairman, honourable committee members, testimony today i provide ecb’s assessment current economic monetary developments. i address number issue topical importance, namely fiscal policy, implementation structural reform and, finally, issue relate euro banknotes. economic monetary development at time last appearance committee april, i foresee annual inflation rate would edge temporarily 2%, mainly account oil price development increase indirect taxes. at time, i state expect economic recovery start second half 2003 continue, albeit gradual pace. in light, i assess outlook price development medium term remain consistent price stability. against background, govern council leave key ecb interest rate unchanged historically low level 2.0% since june 2003. the data become available past month fact confirm outlook i give april. they indicate economic recovery euro area maintain momentum. in second quarter 2004, real gdp grow rate 0.5% relative previous quarter, 0.6% first quarter. the condition continuation economic recovery remain place. on external side, global demand remain robust, notwithstanding temporary fluctuations, contribute euro area export growth. on domestic side, high corporate profitability favourable finance condition support business investment. in particular, level interest rate low historical standards, nominal real terms. private consumption also sustain growth real disposable income and, time lag, improvement labour market. against background, expect present gradual recovery continue come quarter become broadly based, lead somewhat strong upswing course 2005. this picture consistent recent ecb/eurosystem staff economic projection which, may aware, publish quarterly basis. the last projections, publish 2 september, envisage euro area real gdp growth recover 0.5% 2003 1.6% 2.2% average 2004, slightly higher, 1.8% 2.8%, 2005. i add forecast international organisation source convey broadly similar picture. while outlook economic activity surround uncertainty, overall risk appear broadly balanced. on upside, momentum recovery, strong first half 2004 anticipate early year, may imply positive stimulus come quarters. on downside, still concern continue economic imbalance part world could affect sustainability economic recovery, global euro area levels. in addition, oil price reach high level currently expect markets, could dampen somewhat foreign domestic demand, even recent rise oil bi review 52/2004 1 price cannot, mean, compare historical first second oil shock 70 begin 80s. regard outlook inflation, recent oil price developments, together increase indirect taxes, push inflation rate euro area level somewhat high 2% recent months. nonetheless, little evidence yet strong underlie inflationary pressure build domestically. in particular, wage development remain moderate. against background, ecb staff projection put average annual hicp inflation 2.1% 2.3% 2004 1.3% 2.3% 2005. these projection broadly consistent recently release forecasts. however, several upward risk outlook inflation exist. concern relate particular oil price developments, pose potential risk second-round effect emerge wage price-setting. further risk relate future evolution indirect tax administer prices. cross-check economic analysis monetary analysis also support case strong vigilance regard materialisation risk price stability. the prevail low level interest rate fuel monetary credit growth. while m3 growth moderate since summer 2003 result normalisation portfolio allocation behaviour (following ease exceptional economic financial uncertainty prevail previously), remain resilient increasingly drive development liquid components. give strength m3 growth past years, remain substantially liquidity euro area need finance non-inflationary growth. a consequence, inflationary risk could rise. in addition, high excess liquidity strong credit growth could become source strong asset price increases. overall, prospect price development remain line price stability medium term, upside risk price stability emerged. the govern council remain vigilant regard development could imply risk price stability medium term. the market general public rest assure price stability maintain medium term. a regard fiscal policy, late budgetary notification provide mix picture public finance developments. the euro area deficit expect increase slightly. while country maintain sound budgetary positions, significant proportion euro area country expect deficit near 3% gdp. a majority country likely miss original budgetary target set stability programmes. euro area public debt project increase further. with exceptions, public debt remain largely unchanged increase country large fiscal imbalances. although period significant increase public deficit seem come end, important challenge consolidation public finance faced. member state use improvement macroeconomic environment renew consolidation comply commitment stability growth pact. clearly, would add credibility european fiscal framework create confidence sustainability public finances, thereby reinforce confidence overall economic outlook. a recently state ecofin council, budgetary policy need set right priority towards structural reform, innovation competitiveness support lisbon agenda promote economic growth employment creation. fiscal consolidation design form integral part comprehensive reform strategy. a regard european fiscal framework, govern council convince that, whilst substantial improvement implementation stability growth pact welcome, need change text treaty pact itself, namely regulation concerned. the pact important pertinent framework deal countries’ fiscal development level playing-field, particularly within single currency area. at time, consider improvement could introduce implementation. there seem common grind element improve implementation preventive arm, need strong focus public debt sustainability. a regard corrective arm pact, ecb’s main message nominal anchor framework, namely 3% deficit-to-gdp reference value undermined. therefore, proposal would allow loosen excessive deficit procedure, suggestion put forward regard definition exceptional circumstance time frame correction excessive deficits, proposal introduce country-specific element contribute solidity soundness emu view. 2 bi review 52/2004 a sound monetary policy stable macroeconomic framework necessary sustainable economic growth euro area. but alone sufficient. the implementation well-designed structural reform labour, product capital market utmost importance euro area current juncture. the economic recovery would strong sustain ambitious, well-designed structural reform implement improve microeconomic fundamental euro area resilience adverse domestic global economic developments. in respect, convince commitment implementation structural reform successful communication economic benefit general public crucial raise consumer confidence and, ultimately, growth employment. we aware fact structural reform normally take time show improve economic outcomes, often make politically difficult implement reforms. against background much welcome positive step undertake recent month several government parliament euro area strongly encourage continue intensify efforts. issue relate euro banknote let highlight issue relate experience euro banknote first couple years. since introduction euro banknote coin 1 january 2002, circulation steadily increased. indeed, end-august 2004 9 billion banknote value eur 460 billion circulation, increase 10% term volume 18% term value compare circulation one year earlier. a regard quality banknotes, eurosystem closely monitor banknote circulation take appropriate measure refresh cash cycle, needed. at time, ecb currently examine way enhance durability banknotes. moreover, avoid shortage certain denomination within euro area may occur event strong cross-border flow banknotes, eurosystem set cross-euro area stock management scheme. this system greatly enhance efficiency use banknote stocks, since shortage one country compensate excess stock another country. turn issue combat counterfeiting, rate counterfeit relatively stable past 12 months, around 50,000 55,000 counterfeit banknote per month withdraw circulation. assess number number genuine banknote circulation (approximately 9 billion), population euro area country (more 300 million) number cash transaction involve banknote (estimated approximately 120 billion per year), initial year experience euro banknote prove european citizen remain confident security money. that said, improve even efficiency fight counterfeiting, eurosystem recently issue update communication material security features, help cash user spot counterfeits. however, room complacency. cooperation domain constantly improved. in context, steer group comprise representative ecb, commission europol establish ensure exchange information coordination activity field combat counterfeit eu level. at time, international dimension combat counterfeit gain increase importance. to take account development, ecb conclude bilateral agreement interpol - already do europol - focus particular exchange information assistance train education exercises. moreover, ecb cooperate technical level central bank law enforcement authority key country outside euro area euro banknote circulating. in addition, bilateral cooperation agreement combat euro counterfeit recently conclude bulgarian national bank national bank ukraine. i ready answer questions. bi review 52/2004 3 jaime caruana: make diligent preparation basel ii open remark mr jaime caruana, governor bank spain chairman basel committee bank supervision, thirteenth international conference bank supervisor (icbs), madrid, 22-23 september 2004. * * * 1. welcome overview distinguish guest friends: governor bank spain, pleasure serve host thirteenth international conference bank supervisor madrid. i also privilege serve second capacity event chairman basel committee bank supervision. in regard, honour launch dialogue two main theme select conference. a know, committee reach agreement historic revision international capital framework past june. so naturally important focus conference prepare implementation. in addition, basel ii rely increasingly quantification risk exposure understand bank’s risk profile, important ever look behind number rule define exposure measured. the second day conference devote emerge issue account relevance bank supervision. i indebted secretariat basle committee, staff bis, well colleague bank spain, choose speaker encourage lively conversation two themes. in remark morning, i would like open think first implication “basel ii” bank supervision worldwide. while much say sophistication, i believe many overlook key principle basel ii relevant supervisor bank markets. in regard, important remember basel ii’s success depend broad range preparation measure undertake strengthen safety soundness; second part remarks, i offer view mechanisms, lie heart sound system supervision generally. a i mention, many safety soundness goal easily achieve supervisor apply mechanism consistently: make critical basel committee continue expand tie seek great cooperation broad supervisory community. finally, i would like close brief think rule govern transparency disclosure jurisdiction responsibility supervisor encourage continue advancement. with overview, i would like share think implication basel ii supervision, first topic. 2. implication basel ii supervision when last meet community bank supervisor cape town brilliant south african sun, may recall chairman basel committee time, bill mcdonough, describe revision capital framework “tremendous journey” us. he quite right. our journey last five years. supervisors, central bankers, representative industry spend countless hour research debate path follow. the public transparent nature consultation subject proposal intense scrutiny. this make journey difficult one, test ideas, find way improve capital framework. today, two year ocean away mid-point meet cape town, i privilege announce journey “basel ii” conclude key stage spain. for that, i would like express deep appreciation you, member supervisory community, collaboration, contributions, commitment new framework. basel ii emerge remarkable spirit goodwill, cooperation, dedication financial stability share bank supervisor central bank worldwide. by provide perspective experience, help ensure relevance “three pillars” many kind bank many different economies. bi review 52/2004 1 because assistance, question u today whether basel ii applicable particular market. instead, important question basel ii implemented. only national authority answer question. the text publish past june form basis national rule-making approval processes. yet adopt basel ii timetable member country basel committee may feasible countries. in fact, basel ii may less priority compare effort promote fundamental safety soundness country’s bank system. regardless intend adopt basel ii countries, cicero would understand task ahead us: write that, “in matters, beginning, diligent preparation made.” indeed, success basel ii promote health bank system tomorrow depend critically diligent preparation undertake today. so journey begin anew us. a prepare next stage journey, u must encourage bank improve management risk. we must enhance skill supervisors. and must strive make market transparent. cooperation transparency key new journey basel ii play catalytic role. basel ii offer u important way forward provide u tool enhance supervisory systems. a review text basel ii consider next steps, easy impress advance technique quantify risk loss. but formula basel ii revolutionary. the advance approach credit operational risk contain basel ii reflect tremendous advance risk management achieve among sophisticate bank organisations. indeed, rather invent something new, committee adopt many sound practice industry already identified. what new basel ii, matter supervision, marriage two important trends. by build trends, basel ii incorporate principle relevant supervisors. 2.1 first trend: qualitative assessment internal control the first trend capture basel ii represent shift focus safety soundness evaluations. in past, supervisor emphasise use backward-looking evaluation bank’s performance determine financial condition. this draw attention toward past result rather future risk bank’s readiness manage them. in contrast, today many supervisor focus qualitative review internal control structure protect bank specific risks. this represent far difficult way evaluate bank’s safety soundness. it require look beyond number bank’s internal processes. by deepen insight bank’s risk management, gain much good understand strategy controls. we learn risk bank belief ahead measure take mitigate them. we also develop refine sense bank’s sensitivity ability adapt potential condition future. this first trend adopt “risk-focused” approach bank supervision positive effect bank well. when examine quality bank’s risk management, demonstrate management importance ascribe develop maintain safe sound control structures. a risk-focused approach thereby create implicit incentive bank management understand find good way control risks. what result proactive risk management function, also great commitment sound corporate governance across bank. 2.2 second trend: incorporate incentive supervision basel ii recognise result go one step create implicit also explicit economic incentive bank improve quality risk management. the inclusion incentive directly regulatory framework represent second important trend supervision. the proper use incentive help align bank’s objective closely public policy goal safety soundness. in recent years, supervisor begin move generally toward system supervision encourage prudent risk-taking offer incentive rather simply enforce compliance rigid rules. internationally, 1996 market risk amendment 2 bi review 52/2004 exist basel accord represent first time bank receive explicit capital benefit develop sophisticate measure risk, case market risk. basel ii continue trend extend incentive treatment credit risk operational risk. 2.3 basel ii embrace trend by step back bite basel ii’s formulas, see new capital framework build two important trend incorporate new philosophy bank supervision. it combine risk-focused approach supervision incentive prudent risk-taking coherent policy objective seek promote adequate capitalisation. by incorporate three pillar clear incentive bank improve management risk, basel ii reinforce management’s focus control structures. • for example, basel ii’s minimum capital requirement - pillar 1 - regulatory capital charge align closely bank’s measure risk. this create immediate incentive bank improve measures. • likewise, pillar 2 - supervisory review - emphasis responsibility evaluate capital adequacy lie bank’s management. supervisor review respond internal assessments, thereby create incentive bank evaluate exposure thoroughly plan capital strategy carefully. • finally, pillar 3 - market discipline - seek make bank’s risk profile transparent outside investor market participants. this good enable market reward bank take responsible approach risk management penalise not. market discipline serve powerful incentive prudent behaviour: indeed, market sometimes strict supervisors. basel ii’s combination process-oriented focus incentive bank improve risk management offer benefit individual bank bank system whole. for individual bank, basel ii encourage management adopt approach relevant risk bank face appropriate level sophistication. that, turn, ensure bank take prudent step protect losses, include make appropriate use capital resources. the consequence even great macro level. i believe that, risk properly assess manage across banks, bank system become stable, le sensitive swing business cycle, good able promote sustainable growth. this benefit individual banks, also business consumer alike. 3. strengthen foundation basel ii to achieve benefits, supervisor must ensure foundation basel ii ready. basel ii’s success promote improvement risk management, thereby promote financial stability, depend support broad range mechanism measure bank supervisory structure. i’d like turn second part remark offer view element comprise strong foundation, basel ii, also safety soundness broadly. basel ii draw heavily well-known well-tested structure 1988 accord. it retain definition capital notion capital requirement reflect risk asset. the standardise approach credit risk basel ii represent modest revision exist accord. and jurisdiction bank organisation - especially small bank engage traditional, lower-risk business - 1988 accord may remain relevant standard. so supervisor need abandon 1988 accord near future. however, find bank engage advance activities, simplicity 1988 accord quickly become liability. because static rule, fall behind pace innovation advance technology, telecommunications, risk measurement management practices. basel ii provide bank supervisor remedy, one represent flexible forward-looking approach capital supervision. in light, question i hear many supervisor else prepare future move toward basel ii? i believe must strengthen three bi review 52/2004 3 area supervision particular form foundation necessary basel ii - are, themselves, equally crucial safety soundness. first, system effective supervision must exist country. the basel committee previously help identify 25 principle contribute supervisor’s effectiveness. they enumerate core principle effective supervision outline authority resource supervisor must promote financial stability. they include adequate legal authority set apply license criteria, prudential regulation capital requirements; ability conduct ongoing evaluation bank’s operation respond bank fail meet regulatory requirements; ability apply authority consolidate global operation bank organisation domestic operation foreign banks. when apply principle internationally active banks, supervisor must furthermore able share information home host supervisor necessary. second, must ensure market basel ii apply move toward great transparency subject clear set rules. sound account provision standard must enforce capital ratio - however calculate - reflect meaningfully bank’s ability absorb losses. the legal judicial system must make right responsibility bank counterparties clear enforceable bank borrower make effective use collateral, guarantees, measure secure credit. third, must confirm bank industry develop sense “culture” risk management. this perhaps hard criterion define. to great degree, basel ii intend create incentive bank renew focus risk management culture. at minimum, country seek apply basel ii must ensure bank view risk management exercise comply external requirements, rather mean pursue opportunity responsibly. we must understand well risk management art, science: way approach business decisions, provide automatic answers. it successful application require constantly improve skill expertise. it demand use best tool best data available support analyses. and ultimately, require apply best human judgement significant decisions. all u take immediate step strengthen financial supervisory infrastructure along three areas. we must ensure effectiveness supervisory systems. we must improve transparency markets. and must promote development sound risk management cultures. we need implement basel ii formally introduce strengthen principle behind three pillars. however, begin apply principle excellent way lay foundation basel ii future. for example, supervisor could consider continue focus internal process move toward system risk-based supervision, complement enhance traditional supervision. we improve capacity look beyond number evaluate quality capability bank’s risk management measurement. at time, supervisor nurture “risk management culture” emphasise bank responsible evaluate capital need develop strategy maintain capital levels, line principle pillar 2. finally, improve market discipline along line pillar 3, supervisor may wish begin ensure basic level disclosure across banks. they could discus banks, investors, marketplace participant information need understand bank’s risk profile work establish relevant report requirements. clearly, many diligent preparation make come month year prepare basel ii. late today, nick lepan share detail perspective challenge ahead. our workshop afternoon consider plan transition basel ii, prepare adoption advance approach risk management implementation pillar 2, strengthen cooperation home host supervisors. with regard last topic cooperation, i believe safety soundness goal achieve easily supervisor adopt consistent approaches. in particular, basel ii great impact supervisor work concert rather vacuum. this make critical basel committee build tie encourage cooperation supervisors. indeed, i suggest earlier, many improvement basel ii proposal result discussion supervisor central banks. the quality dialogue illustrate good state relation bank supervisor today. this event, example, represent one 4 bi review 52/2004 important opportunity exchange view among committee member supervisors. but begin must translate avenue communication multilateral bilateral levels. in regard, core principle liaison group, cplg, serf main forum exchange basel committee member supervisors. this work group include representative committee member countries, 16 non-g10 supervisors, international monetary fund, world bank. early year, i chair productive special session group. i learn first-hand view cplg member way build committee’s rapport supervisors. i also receive valuable suggestion committee’s projects. the committee continue rely expertise cplg provide non-g10 reaction many main initiatives. for example, accord implementation group, chair nick le pan, vice chairman committee superintendent financial institution canada, hold regular meet cplg bring attention non-g10 issue implement basel ii. beyond stand group, committee seek avenue formal informal discussion supervisors. the cplg recently suggest regional group bank supervisor strengthen activity may serve another channel great communication, cooperation, commitment share objectives. the basel committee long support development mission regional groups. these group foster regional cooperation well continue dialogue basel committee supervisors. more dozen regional group exist, meet yesterday. i encourage continue develop programme own. at meet committee principal various regional groups, discuss additional way strengthen future interaction basel committee regional groups. one formal effort committee member support include event sponsor financial stability institute bank international settlements. the fsi provide technical assistance supervisory agency worldwide enhance quality supervisory system skill staff. the basel committee member agency remain commit activity fsi work together fellow supervisor efficient transparent manner. it one high priority chairman committee strengthen outreach communication fellow supervisors. 4. account our overarch goal discussion help ensure supervisory framework keep pace evolution industry remain relevant bank twenty-first century. this is, course, constant challenge supervisor industry innovative bank sector. yet must furthermore look beyond immediate issue consider broadly many change market practice relevant banks’ safety soundness. in recent years, one important reform affect banking, fact nearly businesses, drive toward harmonise account standard globally. it impossible u improve transparency promote stability without examine change underway mechanic define financial data record reported. i’d like conclude remark morning preliminary think account supervision responsibility field supervisors. i mention early application sound account provision standard key element must build foundation basel ii. when account rule weak poorly enforced, neither bankers, supervisors, marketplace participant much faith ability evaluate safety soundness bank’s operations. no matter sophisticate bank’s risk management system may be, ultimately worthless unable determine worth bank’s asset liability confidently. even standard enforce nationally, substantial difference account standard jurisdiction complicate ability global market exercise discipline effectively allocate capital efficiently across borders. in effort strengthen financial stability, central bank supervisor legitimate interest quality account standard effective implementation. we believe that, order contribute strengthen bank system, account standard support - least consistent - sound risk management control practice banks. in addition, bi review 52/2004 5 facilitate market discipline promote transparent report banks’ financial position performance, risk exposure risk management activities. finally, account standard facilitate effective supervision banks. because view, committee seek participate actively constructively international debate accounting. give interest well promote level play field, ensure effectiveness market discipline, seek efficient allocation capital across borders, support objective towards convergence account guidelines. during tomorrow’s discussions, dr. arnold schilder, executive director bank netherlands chairman committee’s account task force, share committee’s think recent work emerge issue relate accounting, basel ii supervision. after remarks, opportunity meet small group discus issue work ahead supervisor help promote sound practice regard loan accounting, regulatory capital, fair value accounting, well incorporate role external auditor accountant effectively supervisory process. but discussion mark beginning. our focus account supervisory perspective, dialogue account profession, must continue grow year come. 5. conclusion in remark today, i try make clear that, new journey, challenge work remain ahead ready banks, build skill supervisors, promote great transparency markets. a consider preparation must make, might recall word spanish author, miguel de cervantes. in world-renowned novel don quixote de la mancha, write nearly 400 year ago that, “to prepare half victory.” the half, i think, cooperation. likewise, preparation hard work undertake today prepare basel ii will, time, strengthen financial supervisory infrastructure country generally, even implement basel ii. these preparation important help ensure effectiveness supervisory systems, enhance transparency markets, develop sense risk management culture industry. together, contribute promise great financial stability markets. that surely goal worthy preparation demand banks, markets, agencies. we must recognise that, bank become increasingly complex business, job bank supervisor become challenge come years. to promote sound bank risk management practice national, regional, global level, need work together cooperate even future. your participation conference speak interest find way deepen cooperation move next journey supervisors. “el trabajo compartido e ma llevadero,” say spanish: “many hand make light work” - and, look around hall, see many hand ready cooperate. and so, closing, i encourage make unique opportunity build contact work relationship share view work together toward great financial stability future. 6 bi review 52/2004 eva srejber: new eu country - opportunity risk speech m eva srejber, first deputy governor sverige riksbank, student blekinge institute technology karlskrona, ronneby, 20 september 2004. * * * it almost six month since 10 country become new eu members, eight central european nation control communist dictatorship. it say henry kissinger ask zhou enlai, mao’s right-hand man, comment significance french revolution, reply “too early say”. a regard enlargement eu, one big event europe time, likely many decade take stock full consequences, even limit area i intend discus today - economic situation. nonetheless much say dynamic create enlargement, change initiate soon eu open door membership 1990s continue follow entry: in short term immediate problem new member state govern economic policy right way, give objective simply become member eu also join eurozone. in long term opportunity free movement goods, capital least people provide economic growth “old” “new” part eu. finally, i intend touch upon discussion eu change 10 new member state join debate. i deliberately try avoid use word “west” “east”. partly quite simply geographically misleading; say “eastern europe” even though prague ljubljana situate west stockholm, mention vienna athens. we forget riga tallinn close stockholm gothenburg is. but partly also historically mislead since new member state constitute cultural political bloc. besides fifty year oppression, hungary, latvia slovenia le common historically austria, sweden italian, respectively, belong moreover three completely different language groups. i prefer instead “new” “old” way refer situation 10 new member state find in. the short term: path emu in connection eu enlargement intense discussion recent years, old new eu countries, requirement impose new member states’ economic policy. the discussion deal entry eu, key issue already settled, next step: euro. nine ten new member state announce intention introduce euro quickly possible. for changeover would entirely undramatic opportune. for example, estonia lithuania long currency board anchor euro, whereby currency issue certain statutorily establish quantity euro - practice kind “shadow euro”. the currency board anchor euro consider contribute fall inflation stable investment climate. their economy highly flexible term wage price government finance order, thereby able manage situation development baltic country deviate euro area. the fact also opportunity introduce euro expect provide advantage trade price comparisons. but new member state hurry transition euro could give rise problems. to qualify participation eurozone country must meet convergence criterion lay various requirement inflation, interest rates, exchange rate government finances. the baltic state close meet criterion today, already fulfil them. but large new member state big difficulties. one criterion introduce euro country keep exchange rate stable within band set exchange rate mechanism erm2, allow maximum movement exchange rate 15 per cent down. the large new member state - poland, czech republic hungary - today float exchange rate. bi review 51/2004 1 in regard theoretical immediate danger countries. the theoretical problem pressure high growth exert country's economy that, accord balassa-samuelsson theorem, either lead rise exchange rate (nominal appreciation) high inflation rate country (real appreciation). if new member state peg exchange rate euro time high growth euro area countries, should, accord theory high inflation euro area. the problem one convergence criterion introduce euro inflation must 1.5 percentage point high three country eu low inflation. this appear potential catch-22 situation. the variation exchange rate limit two years, inflation cannot rise much; happen growth new member state considerably high euro area, everybody wants. however, i would say mainly theoretical problem - practice prove possible keep inflation reasonably low despite fix exchange rate high growth; case baltic region, example, lithuania even experience deflation high growth. this inflation also affect number variable (competitive pressures, productivity domestic service sector, tax foreign demand). country ireland spain show inflation drive low ahead join euro despite high economic growth, least year convergence criterion assessed. the problem palpable. a currency peg must credible time last (unlike, example, single currency, credible since quite simply cannot changed). a sweden experience begin 1990s, unhealthy government finance erode credibility give rise expectation politician abandon currency peg devalue pull crisis. should expectation strong enough become self-fulfilling, sweden 1992. the problem several central european country government finance deteriorate drastically begin decade. poland, czech republic hungary all, despite spend cuts, still run public deficit 5 per cent gdp year. should peg currency meet convergence criteria, could word risk speculation. in addition, risk remain precarious situation long time gain approval introduce euro; another criterion join euro is, know, maximum public deficit 3 per cent. the bad scenario would therefore countries, euphoria eu entry, peg currency high exchange rate order quickly proceed emu. in situation, problem countries’ government finance would put downward pressure currencies, euro introduction would postpone future reason criterion government finance meet quickly anticipated. it appear risk scenario averted. the four large new member states, spearhead czech republic, make clear government finance must order process enter euro-zone begins. new spend cut plan consolidate government finance country year take next step peg currency prospect euro entry. however, allay concern path euro. it sufficient either, instance, simply save deficit boom exactly meet criterion 3 per cent gdp. firstly, stability growth pact contain requirement keep budget least close balance economic cycle. but must margin budget cope situation development country weak euro area whole (which point swedish official report euro referendum, stabilisation policy monetary union (sou 2002:16), riksbank’s statement this). otherwise risk new member state end germany’s france’s current situation - save despite fact slow economy need stimulation. for reason deficit boom considerably low 3 per cent margin exist economy put hard test slowdowns. on whole concern pressure put government finance order lessen objective join euro postponed. the future tell whether save plan really implement intended. the long term: mobility prosperity although much debate necessarily focus short term, key issue concern long run. on one hand, new member state catch sustainably eu average term prosperity productivity? on hand, “old” eu country benefit enlarge eu order boost growth, many case leave much desired? 2 bi review 51/2004 firstly, let point stand today. accord eu’s statistical agency, eurostat, purchase power adjust gdp per caput eight new eastern central european member state range 77.3 per cent eu average slovenia 42.6 per cent latvia. the rich new member state - slovenia, czech republic hungary - term purchase power close eu average spain portugal join 1986 (slovenia actually par portugal greece today). the country relative level portugal 1986. sometimes gdp curve extend begin 1990s fall output follow liberation communism. these figure many way misleading, however. firstly, considerable manipulation statistic dictatorship, make correct data difficult reconstruct. secondly, output 1989, end communist era, comprise large component heavy military material moreover inferior equipment consumption good never come close sell value market, majority likely unsellable market economy, many unusable even plan economy. the convergence towards eu average go entire period 1992-1993 reliable statistics. gdp grow fast eu rapidly poor country group rich ones. this exactly expect theory international economics long-term convergence productivity prosperity. behind figure lie revolutionary change make structural change eu country pale comparison. for component gdp shrank, another component grown; day old heavy industry close gates, dozen new small enterprise start up. allow give examples: in 1991 private sector constitute 10 per cent gdp estonia; today 80 per cent. manufacturing, account 47 per cent gdp czech republic 1992, comprise 38 per cent, service time rise 44 58 per cent. nevertheless, economic growth new member state high enough. ireland dynamic asian economy grow 9-10 per cent year intense catch-up phase. but large new member state - poland, hungary czech republic - grow percentage point fast average old countries; average furthermore pull poor performance germany, france italy. from come least two conclusions: firstly, poland, hungary czech republic, already fairly substantial public expenditure income level, take care end situation germany, france italy, high expenditures, large deficit considerable need reform. secondly, new old country need broad injection enlargement economic performance. mobility good one key factor behind new member states' growth. when process towards eu entry initiate mid-1990s, majority eu’s barrier trade future member state abandon europe agreements. this result one dramatic least publicise change trade modern time - far significant eu country than, instance, trade china today. the future member states, previously among europe’s close economies, transform year open economy europe - foreign trade correspond 130 per cent gdp hungary czech republic, country equivalent size eu, austria sweden. the eu become completely dominant trade, russia former soviet republic shrink become relatively small trade partner. the countries’ share old eu countries’ trade rise quickly. for sweden eight new member state trade partner always increase share steadily begin 1990s - asian crisis burst it bubble - today comprise 5 per cent sweden’s foreign trade, i.e. par france double china’s share. all indication suggest trend continue deepen. the proportion intermediate good (components) produce new member state behalf western company become increasingly large part trade, proportion good high technological content new member states. mobility good go hand hand mobility capital. several study balance earn cost associate enlargement (e.g. european commission independent institution cepr) high-lighted increase investment one significant advantage eu entry. when country receive timetable eu entry, investor know that, despite political economic upheaval, certain fundamental security institutions. they know rule apply membership shape democracy, market economy eu's bi review 51/2004 3 acquis - regulation agree far new member state adopts. this much case eight new member state become free communism. between 1993 2003 eur 130 billion (sek 1150 billion almost half sweden’s current gdp) invest eight countries, large part capital old eu countries. the investment mainly channel capital industry infrastructure energy telecommunications. a significant swedish example large-scale investment undertake swedbank seb baltic bank system. from 1998 swedish bank acquire part baltic bank system, comprise total ownership almost 90 per cent. the baltic bank system, previously hit several bank crises, since grow fast, annual credit growth 20-30 per cent, give increase opportunity large small firms, also mortgage individuals. a number new services, include internet banking, introduce become widespread. competition relatively tough, decrease margin ordinary financial service foreign bank gradually try gain entry. it likely bank system’s fast development contribute continuous growth entire baltic region current decade. investment flow also help strengthen complementariness industrial structure different part europe. outsource labour-intensive stage low-wage country recently take blame weak job growth unite states. in reality data indicate something else: integration fast-growing country latin america pacific rim crucial factor unite states’ capacity raise productivity prosperity increasingly fast 1990s 2000s. one study carry independent researcher institute nber unite states, cepr europe imf show outsource low-wage country even strengthen employment growth long term. the consultancy firm mckinsey estimate dollar invest outsource india give unite state economic gain usd 1.12-1.14 gain usd 0.33 india. in regard enlargement afford similar opportunity eu europe. there innumerable example investment company new member state result sophisticate cooperation western firms. hungary compete ireland attract computer assembly, slovakia way become one europe’s major car manufacturers, estonia subcontractor swedish clothe firm ericsson. perhaps interest consequence eu membership mobility people, or, known, labour. a common premise discussion labour new member state threaten invade labour market old eu country problem old country even benefit new member states’ inhabitants. i would argue instead quite reverse: unfortunately enough people new member state work old countries, disadvantage us, possibly benefit them. allow begin study say potential migration new member states. accord number study independent academics, flow people old country country introduce transition rule would large spain’s portugal’s entry eu, amount 40 000-670 000, word le 2 per thousand population old countries. the reason modest forecast partly move associate costs, rule apply immigrant domestic worker labour market, last least mobility fairly low new member states, cultural house reason among others. a big problem country high regional unemployment, poland, people even move within country, spite vacant job wage differential 50 per cent. even though six month undeniably short time assessment, record swedish medium single person new member state date apply social welfare form benefit live sweden. look work apply benefit another eu country associate bureaucracy rule costly term live house many people never situation know. this problem labour new member state need old ones. the old country eu presently highly unfavourable demographic situation, previously broad age group retire base active people support reduced. in sweden today, person active population support 0.29 people 65; 2030 ratio estimate rise 0.42. the correspond figure italy belgium even alarming. one way reduce dependency burden increase labour force try get 4 bi review 51/2004 people unemployed, sick early retirement back work. historically, however, reliable way steadily boost labour force immigration, case unite states, example. experience study also show people advance qualification best train often great incentive move, partly wage differential big partly find linguistic cultural barrier easy overcome. so consolidate welfare old countries, increase inflow highly qualify labour new member state would desirable. the question whether correspondingly disadvantage new member states. they somewhat different demographic situation, dependency burden low today, late rise sharply several country exceed italy’s sweden's 20-30 years. there also risk would best-qualified labour would emigrate first. meet broad circle have consider prospects, i would like provide insight enlargement change function eu. the riksbank participate large number eu committees. i member economic financial committee (efc), senior official finance ministry deputy governor central bank eu discus economic issues. the fact 25 country instead 15 therefore considerably table imply changes, course. on one hand, le scope country - central banks, example, don’t participate often efc enlargement speak time per person place great demand concise, brief contributions. on hand discussion vitalise new countries, way le bind tradition new angle approach, sometimes simple reason many lead decision-makers new member state much young colleague old countries. an important point new member state learn old ones; also give old country something think about. for example, several former plan economy today area good adapt emu present eu countries. their wage price line economic performance, could one reason, example, baltic state able pull russian crisis breakdown russian market brief loss growth. the flexibility wage price make therefore unusually well-suited currency union like emu. at time, country shy away reform many lead eu country yet able bring about. estonia, latvia, lithuania, hungary poland have, example, carry comprehensive reform pension systems, resemble swedish model save partly invest funds. in area particular, rather eu something learn candidate country way around. it pope john paul ii said, finally “europe breathe lungs”. the new member state enrich eu, economically also intellectually, course also culturally human terms. the enlargement put eu motion; trade investment, also institution ideas. bi review 51/2004 5 t t mboweni: development foreign exchange market last couple year speech mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, cocktail function honour aci south africa, pretoria, 20 september 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, welcome south african reserve bank. we thank evening, feel honour accept invitation. a engage foreign exchange markets, think might useful make remark involvement market refer recent development regard. we think important critical constituency far work concerned, correct proper time time come together exchange view interact one another. allow congratulate aci south africa select host aci council meet sandton 23rd 27th november year. it first time prestigious event hold south africa. we wish good luck organisation event certain u proud! we also note website also take opportunity draw attention "sights sounds" beautiful country. we also aware important role, aci

competence ethical best practice loyalty set model code. we strongly support attempt promote professional ethical behaviour south africa essential build credible international trade relations, establishing, maintain enhance reputation financial markets. our remark even focus development foreign exchange market last couple years. a good start point appear last time meet organisation central bank. what big issue time last aci cocktail? just touch issues: if memory serf well, meet may 2001, time currency market dominate strong us$ back strong flow usa, although time strong economic growth see 2000 already give way somewhat le favourable growth prospect usa. we surprise us$ still show resilience continue generally strong. a know, thing stay way. in year 2000, rand lose 22% value us$ first five month 2001 rand lose 5.5% us$, seem strange base economic fundamental time. little know, course, end year 2001 would talk 37% depreciation would attack unite states, would precipitate conflict wars, change risk perception financial markets. we talk volatility financial market acknowledge become constant feature process deregulation, liberalisation globalisation continue gather momentum. trade foreign exchange market rand much influence existence nofp forward book, nofp still register negative balance us$9bn, spite significant progress make reduce precarious level us$23bn 1998. this see negative factor rat agency investors, constantly call upon explain go deal situation. bi review 51/2004 1 where journey take u that? a know, period last meet bring major challenge world economy, south africa small open economy get fair share of. however, also face serious challenge relate situation. the second half 2001, especially fourth quarter saw steep depreciation rand, us$, broad base. the situation get point two-way risk inherent trade currency temporarily dislodged, perception exist market rand one-way downward bet. our observation existence large speculative position time compel u issue famous statement october 16, 2001, remind market participant adhere exist rule regulation cover currency trading. it worth note stage much value cooperation receive aci attempt clarify certain issue market player time. whilst many reason advanced, even commission enquiry established, extent development still remain unexplained. that massive depreciation exchange rate rand lead deterioration inflation, represent serious setback u early stage south africa's implementation formal inflation target monetary policy framework. have register success since introduction formal inflation targeting, even manage steer cpix target range september october 2001, knock-on effect currency depreciation result sharp increase inflation 2002, cpix peak 11.3% november 2002. these development necessitate tight monetary policy stance, deliver way repo rate increase total 400 basis point 2002. but back track… we are, however, please say pressure face relatively short-lived. our policy responses, whilst admittedly painful time, together global domestic development allow u resume positive path travel interruption 2001. the currency recover well, contribute good inflation outcome well much improve inflation outlook. this turn allow monetary policy committee reduce repo rate much 600 basis point june 2003 august 2004. it indeed please note cpix inflation measure, one policy judge against, within specify target range 6 - 3 % almost year. a well aware, owe combine effort sa reserve bank national treasury (nt), net open foreign currency position (nofp) finally eliminate may 2003, oversold forward book bank close out, february 2004. we glad say developments, result fully transfer function forward cover provision back bank authorise dealers. those position also major consequence liquidity management money market. in fact complicate life badly! whereas previously huge loss forward book lead structural liquidity surplus money markets, mop use expensive instrument call special money market swaps, operation money market follow one may refer normal central bank patterns. moreover, achievement also enable bank focus increase official reserve internationally acceptable levels. what level is, rather difficult say, appear universally agree upon international benchmark regard. the appropriate level may need evaluate country's specific circumstance size economy degree openness, exchange rate regime, credit rating, risk capital flight, many factors. extensive research subject continue undertake internationally. a state previously, whilst work toward specific target reserve within specific time frame, bank strengthen reserve mainly mean purchasing, reponsible manner, moderate amount foreign exchange market, when, opinion, market condition permit purchase without unduly influence exchange rate introduce unnecessary volatility market. we continue accept exchange rate set market. from time time bank also support national treasury process accumulate reserves, proceed foreign bond issuance sell bank exchange rand. in addition 2 bi review 51/2004 "creaming-off" foreign borrow government, bank also borrow foreign currency name mainly syndicate loan market, increase level gross reserves. the international liquidity position increase $8,6 billion 31 august 2004 gross reserve (including gold reserve approximately 4 million fine ounces) increase slightly $12 billion end last month. this indeed remarkable achievement, one consider time meet 2001, negative nofp stand us$9bn, indicate earlier. some observer time blame bank increase pace accumulate foreign exchange reserves. these well 'educated informed' folk sometimes forget convert negative nofp position $23,2 billion september 1998 positive net reserve position $8,6 billion august 2004, imply six-year period, bank acquire stagger amount almost $32 billion, obtain forex markets. after steady appreciation exchange rate rand since 2003, currency depreciate moderately reduction repo rate 12 august year appear settle r6,50 r6,70 per dollar - approximately level end 2003. various factor one way responsible rand's general appreciation far year. firstly, u dollar depreciate major currencies, benefit currency many emerging-market countries. secondly, high commodity price international market support commodity-based currency like rand. thirdly, accommodative policy stance develop country result positive interest-rate differential emerge market country compare counterparties within industrialise countries. this still case respect south africa despite overall reduction 600 basis point repo rate since june 2003. fourthly, number significant corporate transaction result increase supply foreign exchange fifthly, momentum technical trade may also contribute rand strengthen recent months. another important factor generally support mention fact overall perception, sentiment like call markets, south africa improving, international investor make positive assessment political, fiscal monetary management process country recent years. it also interest note volatility condition domestic foreign exchange market seem normalise course 2004. for example, one-month historical volatility rand decline recent high 28,4 percent january 2004 12,2 per cent june 2004, pick 20 per cent. another measure volatility, namely difference high low exchange rate record month, decline r1,36 january 2004 around 50 cent last months. although standard still represent fair degree volatility, one see context south africa open economy expose international foreign exchange market fairly volatile recently. our effort regard strengthen reserve level time contribute le volatile exchange rate. the average daily turnover rand domestic foreign exchange market decline us$6 billion 2002, remain fairly subdue us$7,7 billion 2003. in 2004 end september, average daily turnover rand increase us$8 billion, reach level last record 1999. we continue see active participation non-residents forex markets, especially swap market, share non-residents currently amount around 65%. non-residents account 60% total turnover foreign exchange market. high turnover generally correlate positively market activity also provide good measure market liquidity. liquidity rand market usually increase currency behave predictable manner. however, uncertain trade environment, bid-offer spread widen market lose depth market participant become reluctant quote prices, case 2001. during latter part 2001, bid-offer spread widen approximately ten cent (from three cent early year) regular trade amounts. condition improve drastically since spread narrow back approximately three cent currently. the price discovery mechanism forex market follow much normal pattern two-way-risk. give forex dealers, need elaborate. many live able tell story rand much better. one thing seem confirm now: rand long one-way downward bet. hopefully lesson learn regard, deal rooms, expensive! bi review 51/2004 3 conclusion a deduct above, many area bank daily contact market place. we value relationship dearly. it yourselves, bank industry financial market south africa, bank able implement monetary policy. you essential pillar monetary policy transmission mechanism. we wish well organisation. we hope may grow strength strength. once thank role play enhance reputation financial markets. enjoy even u safe journey home. thank you. 4 bi review 51/2004 lars heikensten: the economic situation monetary policy speech mr lars heikensten, governor sverige riksbank, swedish embassy, london, 20 september 2004. * * * thank invitation swedish embassy opportunity speak economic situation swedish monetary policy. it important riksbank come london occasionally meet participant financial market regularly follow swedish economy work. my intention today give broad picture view concern inflation outlook year ahead. the start point recent inflation report may assessment press release riksbank publish thereafter. i also discus particularly issue recently touch upon monetary policy debate: oil price development household indebtedness well development residential property prices. follow introduction i look forward lively discussion. international development the riksbank’s assessment late inflation report may international economic activity would continue strengthen year come two years. during summer conclude reason somewhat optimistic economic growth year. the high oil price indeed judge stifle growth somewhat, extent would derail upswing. development differ somewhat various regions. our assessment may economic growth unite state would slow end year, chiefly due assumption fiscal policy would le expansionary. couple gradually rise interest rates, judge would dampen private consumption house investment somewhat. despite slowdown, however, economic outlook expect mainly bright come years. data second quarter indicate private consumption slow somewhat early anticipated. it possible partly due high oil price, low households’ real incomes. even though recent data unite state give mix impression, i think reason somewhat le optimistic development unite state period ahead indicate assessment may. growth year almost 4½ per cent appear likely. in 2005 2006 reason today expect 3½ per cent annual gdp growth. growth euro area judge late inflation report increase gradually year follow weak development 2003. new information summer broadly confirm outlook. in germany mainly net export contribute positively gdp growth, countries, notably france spain, seem domestic demand grow relatively quickly. for euro area, appear reasonable expect growth 2 per cent year slightly high figure next two years. for nordic region, uk rest europe well latin america asia, many analyst revise growth forecast since end spring. this partly number new statistic release area robust many expected. russia latin american country also benefit high price commodities. a regard asia primarily outlook japanese economy become increasingly optimistic. at end last year economic growth high fifteen years. there many indication slowdown japanese growth rate recently relation development recent year still relatively strong. china experience rapid industrial expansion average annual growth almost 10 per cent past ten years. this year, too, growth high. one contributory factor strong growth investment increase sharply. nevertheless, analyst expect growth china somewhat low year ahead, owe measure take dampen demand. take together possible now, time monetary policy meet august, reason somewhat optimistic economic growth abroad year compare bi review 51/2004 1 riksbank’s assessment may. the high oil price could indeed dampen upswing somewhat le positive signal summer unite states, among countries. but appear counter growth part world, seemingly robust forecast may. in context may worth note sweden’s trade country china india still relatively small, country outside oecd area (oecd-19) together account 20 per cent swedish export markets. this compared, example, unite states, whose share swedish export 10 per cent. if performance country strong, course great significance sweden. financial market development summer entirely line expectations. equity price development relatively weak. both short-term long-term interest rate accordingly weak anticipated. the cause weak development interest rate uncertainty, primarily strength u economic upswing effect high oil price global growth. however, uncertainty seem diminish somewhat recently, partly result robust labour market data unite states. this lead recovery stock market. when riksbank inflation report look ahead couple years, important influence recent weeks’ movement financial markets, rather stick fundamental, longer-term assessment economic developments. a long don’t markedly change view future economic prospect inflation outlook, is, opinion, neither reason change view early summer future financial conditions. interest rate today low historical perspective expect rise somewhat global resource utilisation pick up. at time, krona appreciate somewhat, partly due continue substantial surplus sweden’s trade countries. the oil price monetary policy in may, riksbank forecast international inflation increase year, primarily result rise global resource utilisation. development since point somewhat strong rise price expected. to extent due unexpectedly high price oil. a couple week ago oil price reach record-high level today roughly high oil crisis in1979-80. an unexpectedly steep increase global demand oil, least rapidly grow chinese economy, seem significant drive force behind rise oil price 2004. this lead mark decrease idle capacity oil sector. other relevant factor include unease situation middle east various circumstance surround russian company yukos. the rapid, short-term change characterise price formation oil market also point insignificant element speculation. exactly weight attribute different factor time time difficult establish. but clear overall price rise 2004 demand-driven large degree compare occasion oil price rise sharply. the increase oil price 1973-74, 1979-80 1990 know essentially result reduction oil supply. the demand oil course play important part price development period ahead well. a key aspect country previously economically undeveloped take step towards energy-intensive production. even new innovation put use couple years, fast growth many develop country point relatively high oil price period ahead, too. nevertheless, analyst expect supply large oil price fall back fairly sharply current level next years, geopolitical concern diminish. future price indicate oil price fall usd 5 10 per barrel come two years. in long run also expect oil price hold back energy-efficient production method gradually introduce also recently industrialise countries, way happen west oil crisis 1970s. but likely process take fairly long time. an increase oil price often problematic stabilisation policy perspective. this tend push inflation time dampen effect real economy. this make difficult simultaneously stabilise inflation output. the appropriate policy must quite simply determine case case due part persistence rise oil price, 2 bi review 51/2004 price economy affected, factor otherwise drive inflation process. there aspect current situation may worth highlight context. a i say earlier, rise oil price past year has, previously sharp oil price increases, due pickup demand oil owe world economic expansion. a rise price oil largely result high international growth likely le negative consequence real economy outright supply shock. in addition this, course, economy west - particularly swedish one - far le dependent oil oil crisis 1970s. this mean impact oil price rise real economy inflation would considerably limit prove case time. the assessment analyst today seem also increase oil price 2004 could indeed curtail somewhat international economic upswing recovery derailed. the impact oil price inflation, too, le before. since oil price shock 1970s shift economic policy regime many country mean low, stable inflation become one central target economic policy. today, low-inflation policy seem enjoy high credibility countries, indicate part fact rise oil price least far small effect inflation expectations. the risk oil price rise spread wage price economy therefore also likely low. furthermore, case sweden add inflation rise low level agreement labour market settle 2005 2006, reduce risk contagion effect via job market. to sum up: fact increase oil price partly demand-driven phenomenon, dependency oil decrease inflation-targeting regime enjoy high credibility suggest high oil price mainly reflect temporary, limit rise inflation effect real economy fairly small. if correct, general economic inflationary development significant monetary policy development oil price. this bring discussion broad outlook swedish economy year ahead. economic activity sweden despite riksbank’s relatively optimistic outlook swedish economy compare forecasters, gradually revise forecast past year. our assessment may economic activity sweden would continue strengthen period ahead owe relatively loose monetary fiscal policy expect economic upswing abroad. gdp growth forecast average almost 3 per cent 2004 2006. one reason cause revise growth forecast export increase unexpectedly fast. export growth robust international demand general grow rapidly anticipate relative price swedish export unexpectedly low. a i point earlier, 20 per cent swedish export go country outside oecd area economic growth vigorous. during first half year export goods, measure current prices, rise 9 per cent compare period 2003. swedish export also benefit part revival it telecommunication sectors. however, robust growth export unique sweden; average export growth eu roughly strong first half year. another positive signal pickup investment, riksbank forecaster wait long time for, seem begun. this major contributory factor positive outlook swedish economy late monetary policy meet august. since monetary policy meet august, government collaboration party announce proposals, intend present detail budget bill, may entail expansionary fiscal stance period ahead. these proposal include cut income tax households, abolish inheritance gift tax, low wealth tax increase support local governments. in total, estimate provide stimulus sek 20 billion 2005 2006. how large impact economic growth inflation easy forecast. this partly dependent extent household save increase incomes. use traditional rule thumb could entail tenth one per cent high gdp growth 2005 bi review 51/2004 3 2006. a thing stand, therefore, reason expect growth average 3 per cent come two years. in spite fact economy perform fairly well almost two years, development labour market far weak. even though demand labour still low, situation nonetheless judge stabilise somewhat. the historical pattern employment lag behind change output somewhat. it common economic upswings begin manufacturing, result rise manufacture employment. gradually, also increase output service sector, boost employment sector. our judgement also case time. at time, important remember process structural change underway swedish economy time, job manufacture sector replace job private service sector. this development, too, likely continue period ahead. consequently, reason expect robust growth manufacture employment come years. furthermore, current economic upswing, appear take somewhat long usual job pick up. the number hour worked, hand, rise normal current economic climate. firm thus appear boost production make great use already employ staff instead recruit new employees. although still considerable uncertainty development labour market, nevertheless likely number employ increase time around turn year. at roughly time unemployment able begin fall. the side coin robust growth subdue job market continue high productivity growth low cost pressure swedish economy. the extent temporary due economic activity, result longer-term factors, hard determine. it therefore also difficult judge productivity develop period ahead. our assessment robust productivity partly reflect longer-term change also due economic situation, thereby partly transitory nature. we examine assessment regularly, course. in order judge demand economy affect future inflation important good picture resource utilisation. there exact measure this, however. in late inflation report, assessment total resource utilisation economy still relatively low would rise gradually 2006 reach level long would restrain price wage increases. new data national institute economic research, example, suggest resource utilisation still relatively low, even though indicator completely accord. the indicator base labour market condition point consistently low resource utilisation. the somewhat strong gdp growth reason expect suggests, however, idle resource employ somewhat fast rate forecast may august. house price debt level one issue importance riksbank several reason household indebtedness development residential property prices. the riksbank require maintain price stability. in addition bank require promote efficient, stable payment system. furthermore, objective met, bank also attempt take account target economic policy, e.g. economic growth high employment. development household indebtedness house price significant respects. when forecast inflation, riksbank try take account connection indebtedness development house prices, one hand, inflation other. for example, may question judge large impact rise house price household wealth and, next stage, demand economy. these relationship way simple straightforward, even though statistical study show clear correlation different variables, entirely possible underlie explanations, e.g. sentiment economy, could affect relationships. in case, produce forecasts, best estimate effect house price indebtedness. the riksbank also illustrate regularly effect payment system development house price household debt, mainly bank’s report financial stability. our assessment far sign property price markedly balance. high growth households’ disposable incomes, low interest rate low level house construction, couple increase demand housing, may large extent justify price rise see house market national level, well current debt levels. it also possible increase debt partly adjustment 4 bi review 51/2004 economy - compare - good function financial markets, low inflation expectation relatively low interest rate future. most indication also suggest majority household would able service debt even interest rate rise sharply. nor appear likely bank mortgage institution would risk incur loss would appreciably affect capital bases. this wasn’t case either financial crisis begin 1990s. while banks’ loss crisis largely propertyrelated, stem lend collateral house loan secure commercial properties. and price commercial property time show development price residential property. on contrary, fall economic decline still recovered. what remain effect economy general. in respect perhaps first question whether build-up debt development house price prove unsustainable, price therefore fall whole result decline real economy general. the risk happen course relate view residential property prices. if seem highly elevate relation before, difficult justify establish economic arguments, risk greater. the risk problem also connect economic developments. if stable, small probability borrow buy house make decision late prof wrong grounds. an example illustrate latter form reasoning. interest rate currently all-time low. this indicate rise, assumption household ought take account. however, many may also count rise income, normal situation; interest rate usually rise point economic growth thereby income society increases. there course risk here. a couple decade ago experience long period low growth high inflation. if repeat - although present appear likely - quite possible many household would encounter difficulties. to sum up, one say riksbank normal work process take account, far possible, effect indebtedness house price inflation via effect on, instance, consumption general demand. these effect take consideration inflation forecasts. in addition, might choose include effect payment system general economic performance if, instance, saw significant risk future financial crisis. the clarification monetary policy publish 1999 state would explain clearly reason behind decision situation arise. naturally, question - whether risk sufficiently large require special consideration monetary policy decision - simple one. it concern weigh difficult issue opinion may differ time time. so far, however, consideration regard effect house price household indebtedness factor inflation rate play marginal role interest rate policy. inflation monetary policy let conclude summary current view inflation monetary policy. since early summer, inflation sweden develop roughly line riksbank’s assessment may. inflation low swedish international standards, around 1 per cent. at time, important emphasise decisive factor monetary policy present inflation rate, view regard future inflationary pressures. at monetary policy meet may, riksbank judge inflation would remain relatively stable come year increase gradually result rise international domestic resource utilisation. give risk saw u - primarily slightly strong economic upturn - inflation expect line riksbank's inflation target couple year ahead. this repo rate leave unchanged. the outlook may change significantly meet june august. however, observe august economic growth appear slightly strong sweden abroad. this mean also reason expect slightly high resource utilisation. moreover, economic upturn continue couple months. what present outlook inflation come years? my assessment conclusion draw riksbank previous meet august remain valid whole. it likely, however, upward revision inflation forecast may warrant compare bi review 51/2004 5 may assessment, perhaps even compare august forecast. in short term high oil price point scenario. it also appear reasonable expect somewhat high resource utilisation come year compare may august. factor support strong data release summer expansionary fiscal policy appear likely. another factor international developments, appear strong. slightly high resource utilisation lead slight increase inflationary pressure come years, compare previous assessments. there are, course, uncertainty factors. i already mention uncertainty surround international developments. another uncertainty factor concern development labour market, turn relate productivity growth. on whole likely reason revise somewhat inflation forecast compare may inflation report. inflation couple year ahead nevertheless expect roughly line riksbank’s target. but economy activity continue strengthen, likely imply le idle resource economy, reason expect gradually rise inflationary pressures. thank you! 6 bi review 51/2004 bandid nijathaworn: thailand’s economic condition prospect - mid-year update speech mr bandid nijathaworn, deputy governor bank thailand, luncheon organise australian-thai chamber commerce, bangkok, 27 august 2004. * * * let begin first thank australian-thai chamber commerce invitation speak today. for australian-thai chamber, first i please here. today, i plan cover evolve economic picture home abroad. for global economy, number interest new theme emerge i try put development perspective understand bank thailand. a domestic economy, despite number risk challenges, year economy manage well circumstances. growth momentum remain firm economic stability remain intact. today, i open new kind inquiry thai economy, simply update recent economic outturn explain rationale behind week's decision monetary policy committee increase policy interest rate. this decision, first increase three years, expect market follow sign increase pressure domestic price follow assessment communication market low interest rate become le necessary give change outlook inflation. let begin global economy. at present, still much case firm recovery global economy continue first half year. growth g3 economy first half year estimate 4.9 percent us, 5.2 percent japan, 1.9 percent eu, accelerate rate growth observe second half last year. for whole year, even allow recent high oil prices, market still anticipate continue recovery global economy drive economic expansion us, japan, asia. the late consensus forecast put global economic growth year 4 percent, significantly high average past three years. to put number perspective, worthwhile note sentiment global economy time le robust perception six month ago. this change drive part recognition reversal several important factor support global growth since second half last year begin impact global economy. the key factor i refer include high oil prices, rise global interest rates, slow chinese economy. while outlook global economy remain firm, persistently high oil price softness recent u data shift balance risk downside. the key issue time thus oil prices, key question high oil price affect global economy go forward. lady gentlemen, this year price oil go 40 percent. the dubai price, key reference price thailand, go last year’s average us$ 27 per barrel us$ 39 per barrel. domestic retail oil prices, however, go le price support scheme government running. this help limit immediate effect high global oil price economy. but notwithstanding subsidies, domestic inflation rising. headline cpi inflation, example, rise 3.1 percent july. at time, believe substantial price pressure build economy could eventually translate high consumer price proft margin adequately squeezed. this pen - price pressure link high global oil price yet pass consumer prices, also continue high level capacity utilization report tighten segment labour market. the risk global growth high oil price issue capture attention financial markets. compare previous episode high oil prices, time high oil price could well persist long increase drive rise global energy demand well supply disruptions. but oil price real term still low peak level oil crisis 1980’s, global economy also become le dependent oil, bi review 50/2004 1 common wisdom time high oil price put pressure global growth inflation derail ongoing momentum global recovery. a rise interest rates, risk global growth come high global interest rate far look le threatening. this interest rate especially u increase low level do gradually. in case us, increase indication feed regard current recovery solid. moreover, increase rate good maintain economic stability well address global imbalances, increase interest rate see good thing welcomed. against background, bank thailand see global recovery continue firmly short term despite high oil prices. this year, thailand’s export market - measure gdp growth major trade partner - expect grow 5 percent. this growth key factor support export year. at time, thailand’s export china continue expand, though low rate compare last year’s. hence, effect slow chinese economy export factor monitor closely. for first half year, i happy report thailand’s export australia grow 16.6 percent import australia grow 38 percent. australia thailand’s 11th 12th large trade partner export imports, respectively, claim share 2.3 percent thailand’s total trade. and recent conclusion bilateral free trade agreement two countries, trade two economy likely grow grow. a global financial markets, let say briefly year global financial market dominate change expectation pace time monetary policy tighten us. and lead global repricing financial asset reversal international capital fows, especially away emerge markets. so far, repricing asset unwind position quite orderly finance u current account deficit continue smooth. in broad terms, bond yield increased, equity price declined, u dollar appreciate nominal effective terms. in term policy, key issue global economy manage transition high interest rate environment safeguard economic stability view continue firm growth. another management risk high oil price might affect global recovery. and third issue address major global imbalance without create serious volatility financial markets. let turn domestic economy. this year theme keep recur presentation thai economy risk adjustment. this say that, thailand, year year great risk key theme adjust risk global economic financial environment become le helpful. the key external pressure thai economy throughout year high oil prices, high global interest rates, potential impact export slow chinese economy. this year, also domestic challenges. these include two episode bird flu affect production export poultry, uncertainty link situation south importantly affect consumer confidence business sentiment. so, part, performance thai economy year essentially story domestic economy adjust risk emerged. this include adjustment domestic financial market real economy, well implication economic financial stability. let go point turn. a domestic financial markets, adjustment lead repricing financial asset underway since second quarter. yield long bond rising. equity price declined. there outflow short - term capital, baht weaken last year. in all, adjustment smooth orderly, benefit flexible market mechanism underpin movement economy’s key prices. and real economy, adjustment accompany moderation growth first quarter 6.5 percent, lead slowdown agriculture drought bird flu. output manufacture services, however, continue expand robustly. on demand side, 2 bi review 50/2004 dampen consumer confidence moderate momentum private consumption first half year, private investment export expand well key driver growth far year. on point, comfort note domestic demand expansion benefit increasingly pick-up credit extension, drive ample liquidity system. private credit growth high 9 percent end-june. turn economic stability, continue growth, pressure resource become visible year output gap continue close, inflation rising, trade surplus narrow tighten labour market reported. overall external stability, hand, remain strong continue current account surpluses, fall external debt, high international reserves. but high oil price rebound investment evidently put great pressure import trade balance. one thing monitor closely year financial stability. some indicator financial fragility rising. these include rise household indebtedness active real estate sector. although sign overheat yet two sectors, development need monitor closely especially credit cycle turning. this potential become source financial fragility growth leave unchecked. in all, domestic economy seem adjust well great risk challenge emerged. the pace growth moderate last year’s overall growth momentum still look firm economic stability remain sound. the key issue go forward risk pose high oil price outlook domestic growth inflation. and pessimistic scenario, important question resilient domestic economy absorb much large shock, say persistently high oil prices. in meet monetary policy committee last wednesday, member monetary policy committee spend considerable time discuss type question base preliminary analysis prepare staff bank thailand. while number still preliminary, result seem suggest great trade-off growth inflation go forward. in particular, high oil price adversely affect growth inflation, effect inflation project pronounce pent-up pressure price mention earlier. reflect this, committee felt risk economic stability increase high oil price proper monetary policy vigilant inflation. so, recovery momentum remain firm risk economic stability rising, monetary policy committee saw le need maintain low interest rate felt monetary policy stance adjust give priority economic stability, adjustment gradually paced. this essentially rationale behind decision wednesday monetary policy committee raise policy interest rate 25 basis points. at juncture, many may wonder whether high oil price together high domestic interest rate might punitive health domestic economy. let say look carefully issue opinion growth momentum time quite firm. although adverse effect growth high domestic interest rate there, effect large extent derail ongoing momentum recovery. this fundamental economy present quite good, strong fiscal position, two factor allow economy flexibly adjust negative shock without interrupt momentum growth. on contrary, early rise domestic interest rate help maintain macroeconomic stability cruial sustain economic growth medium term. lady gentlemen, a week ago, i good fortune visit melbourne sydney come across concept cleanskin wine. for home while, cleanskin wine quality wine sell cheaply unlabeled. so, get something good don’t know don’t know is. half hour ago, thai economy year many like cleanskin wine. you know economy good don’t know why. bi review 50/2004 3 in brief space time, i hope i give adequate account bank thailand see thai economy evolve year, hopefully help improve understand economy. a cleanskin wine, i definitely go back more. i hope continue confidence thai economy remain trust friend dependable partner thailand many many year come. thank you. 4 bi review 50/2004 edward m gramlich: oil shock monetary policy remark mr edward m gramlich, member board governor u federal reserve system, annual economic luncheon, federal reserve bank kansa city, kansa city, 16 september 2004. * * * oil shock confound macroeconomist since first arise scene 1970s. the oil price spike time clearly significant macroeconomic implications, represent one rare time high price individual industry importantly affect overall macroeconomy. to account effects, structural-model builder disaggregate system oil non-oil, energy non-energy, sectors, deal effect demand supply side economy. the need make distinction greatly complicate task economic-model builder ever since. the challenge even pronounce policymakers - fiscal monetary. in world shock demand side, policymaking boil find optimal balance inflation unemployment, modern parlance, find strategy hit optimal point frontier relate variance inflation unemployment around target values. such exercise quite complicated, build sort lag expectation effects; basic analytical model around long time, reason familiar. with oil shocks, policymakers confront new dilemma. policy must balance compete objective presence shock normally imply inflation, unemployment, combination thereof. in environment, choice become difficult, public perception well stabilization policy inevitably decline. however, possible distinguish good bad policy choices, even choice look especially desirable. my remark address choice make them. i first review evidence seriousness oil shock macroeconomy discus i think monetary policy generally respond. i follow brief discussion current situation unite states. how serious oil shocks? oil shock serious effect economy immediately raise price important production input - oil - important consumer good - gasoline heat oil. they also likely push price energy markets. these price increase significant enough typically show temporary burst overall rate inflation. they may even get pass continue rate inflation become incorporate price- wage-setting behavior. increase oil price also reduce consumer spend power, much way new excise tax pass along oil producers. to extent producer foreign, correspond drop domestic demand. even oil producer domestic, drop domestic demand could still occur producer spend much new income consumer would recycle profit shareholders. estimate impact oil shock real economy do least two ways. one approach, often associate jam hamilton, measure reduced-form correlation oil price movement subsequent movement unemployment, output gaps.1 such analysis show figure 1, compare aggregate real oil price measure overall output gap.2 the figure show since 1973 every upward spike real oil price follow jump output gap. however, jump seem much large account oil price alone, appear symmetric macro response downward oil price shocks. but result still impressive oil price shock perceive 1 jam d. hamilton (1983), "oil macroeconomy since world war ii," journal political economy, vol. 91, (april), pp. 228-48. 2 specifically, hodrick-prescott filter standard tune parameter. bi review 50/2004 1 temporary, measure difference oil spot price far future price (discussed below). presumably, macroeconomic impact would even powerful price shock perceive permanent. hamilton others run series causality test macro data find significant causal effect oil prices. one also analyze oil price shock use structural econometric models. these model would typically build sort price-responsiveness behavior measure pass-through effects. they would account effect high energy price real disposable income spend demand household sector. they would make similar calculation business investment, work impact oil price cost capital business-cash flows, extent influence overall investment spending. when one this, many economist days, one see effect one-third 1 percent unemployment slightly core inflation rate permanent shock price oil $10 barrel.3 with appropriate transformations, structural effect appear good bite small implication reduced-form correlations. why difference? many source discrepancy reduce form effect structural effect possible. one involve consumer - perhaps serious oil price shock could affect consumers’ confidence spend plan way would capture work effect normal income price elasticities. capital investment may also affect oil price shock encourage producer substitute less-energy-intensive capital more-energy-intensive capital. of course, substitution necessarily low aggregate demand require investment demand new energy-saving equipment. oil pervasive commodity, type non-model effect possible, consumption investment effect seem obvious. how monetary policy respond oil price shocks? monetary policy maker country dual mandate, stabilize price maximize sustainable employment long run. their response oil price increase focus two objectives. at one extreme, monetary policy maker might focus exclusively demand-reducing effect oil shock try stabilize unemployment rates. the risk approach price would rise full amount imply shock would likely pass wage price increases. continue inflation rate could bump full amount initial boost inflation. the continue inflationary potential oil price shock would, effect, maximized. at extreme, monetary policy maker could focus exclusively neutralize initial impact shock inflation. give initial oil price shock, approach would entail reduce demand enough stabilize overall, core, inflation rates. if price sluggish response change unemployment, approach could entail large increase unemployment shock. most observer would choose policymaking approach somewhere two extremes. if, example, monetary policy maker try keep overall nominal income steady path, direct rise nominal income oil price shock would meet fall real income somewhat high unemployment. the result would temporary rise inflation unemployment. because temporary rise unemployment would damp price pressures, chance initial oil price inflation would pas continue inflation would reduced. most likely, initial inflationary boost would prove temporary, permit rise unemployment temporary well. but nominal income target deficiencies. first, since large share u.s. oil imported, significant difference could exist value-added price deflator comprise nominal income more-appropriate measure true consumer price inflation. monetary policy maker would good focus directly more-appropriate measures. second, before, price highly sensitive supply shock sensitive output movements, even nominal income target could imply substantial increase unemployment. 3 core consumer price inflation define exclude direct energy food price hence accurately measure continue effect oil price shock. 2 bi review 50/2004 a good approach would follow policy rule base directly target value unemployment appropriate measure inflation. one example taylor rule, monetary policy maker would move short-term target interest rate - federal fund rate unite state - respond deviation core inflation unemployment target values.4 the result would qualitatively similar nominal income target rule, temporary rise inflation unemployment, though increase would key underlie monetary policy objectives. because offset policy reactions, real federal fund rate would likely remain approximately constant chain events. if did, nominal fund rate would first rise fall inflation rate itself. while perfect outcome, target intermediate approach probably best done. be policy try avoid rise unemployment, initial oil price shock might get pass continue inflation. be policy try avoid rise inflation, movement unemployment would substantial. the best approach likely accept temporary rise inflation unemployment, increase base underlie objectives. the rise would temporary long inflation persistently deviate long-term price-stability target. but even prefer approach, widely watch nominal federal fund rate would likely rise time. current event with backdrop, i turn current situation. a show figure 2, spot price oil (solid line) recently spike up, several time since 1985.5 but contrast oil-price-spike episodes, time far future price oil - is, price contract seven year - also rise sharply. this correlation seem indicate present oil price increase view purely temporary shock. at time, show figure 3, plot difference spot price future price, current price still great far future price, represent phenomenon know backwardation.6 because backwardation, oil price shock still seem important temporary component. one question arise immediately whether source shock matters. in 1970s 1980s, oil shock seem clearly supply side international producer withhold production world market, either attempt gain oil revenue supply interruptions, iranian revolution. today, high price oil much likely due demand growth unite states, china, india, countries. doe source matter try determine monetary policy respond? if demand growth cause oil price increase domestic, could mean price shock might le permanent. the high oil price would cut demand growth tend stabilize system. if demand growth foreign, say china india, feedback effect still present damped. even foreign demand oil might influence reduce demand growth unite state trade partners. it certainly possible oil shock partially motivate demand may le permanent true supply shocks, though reason contradict current-day oil future prices. this whole issue, however, new imperfectly understood. it much silver lining, present price burst might provide information qualitative difference domestic international demand supply shocks. a second question whether present shock large enough cause macroeconomic ripples. a figure 1 shows, even present high real price oil half real price 1980, importance energy overall economy also le half then. at time, figure 2 suggest permanent oil price rise order $15 barrel. since unite state import 4.5 billion barrel oil per year, price rise make effective reduction 4 name john b. taylor (1983), "discretion versus policy rule practice," carnegie-rochester conference series public policy, vol. 39 (december), pp. 195-214. 5 astute chart-gazers note commonly quote price figure 2, barrel west texas intermediate crude oil, high current price oil gross domestic product show figure 1. that because, average, unite state us low quality oil production total output. 6 a stock exchange term percentage pay seller stock privilege delay delivery agree future date. in effect, future price le spot price. bi review 50/2004 3 domestic income $68 billion. to extent dollar go domestic oil producer fully recycled, effective demand reduction could even greater. there could also important parallel effect natural gas markets. the rise consumer price sources, well reduction aggregate demand, could noticeable. all thing considered, although present oil shock may significant shock remember 1970s 1980s, definitely register. a final issue involve initial position economy monetary policy. in usual exercise, one analyze economy sort equilibrium position posit oil price shock, normally result temporary increase inflation unemployment describe earlier. when monetary policy begin inordinately low nominal interest rates, reason become complicated. now response oil shock is, effect, superimpose re-equilibration process build monetary policy. the ultimate response economy blend two responses, though additively complicate nonlinear structure economy. the net effect factor difficult perceive broad outline. without oil shock, policymakers begin period low interest rate would try keep economy even growth path gradually raise nominal interest rates. with shocks, nominal rate would still likely follow upward path, though economic reaction would bumpier, temporary rise inflation unemployment. conclusion a new economic event 1970s, oil price shock force monetary policy maker rethink rule add new chapter macroeconomic textbooks. today question respond oil price spike good understood, outcome pleasant. it virtually inevitable shock result combination high inflation high unemployment time. but i must stress bad possible outcome temporary increase inflation unemployment. the bad possible outcome monetary policy maker let inflation come loose moorings. 4 bi review

professional sri lanka well many neighbor countries. i sure excellent opportunity u promote goodwill among ourselves. it also give u opportunity share think way forward south asia’s currency financial markets, theme year’s conference. forex, well know, large financial market world. unlike many markets, international forex market open 24 hour day. it daily turnover well us$ 1.2 trillion. this turnover combine turnover world’s major stock market give day. hence, international forex market liquid, thus, desirable market trading. a market, technology also contribute immensely towards expansion. now trade execute increasingly internet. it allow even small investor access market. a conservative central banks, involvement forex market limit strategic investment stabilise exchange

market segments, namely, foreign exchange market, money market, government debt security market stock market inter-linked. the central bank, watch operation market segment individually, need take macro view market segment ensure financial market stability. the focus today, however, foreign exchange market. in exchange rate area, appropriate mention juncture, sri lankan authority make fundamental change policy 23rd january, 2001 move freely float exchange rate arrangement. this necessitate inability prevail exchange rate system crawl band regime sustain themselves. immediately float, market experience volatility usually expected. however, volatility contain overall since then. this, bring confidence market, evidence increase foreign exchange inflows, also allow great flexibility market opportunity foreign exchange dealer commercial banks. subsequent float, central bank become net buyer foreign exchange market, sharp contrast experience period prior that. our objective regard foreign exchange market ensure orderly adjustment exchange rate, without excessive volatility. such adjustment reflect emerge economic fundamental country. we ensure demand supply mismatch address time excessive volatility exchange rate. turn theme year’s conference, i.e. “is time common currency saarc region?”, i believe would give rise much interest think provoke discussion debate. we know saarc establish 1985, objective provide platform people south asia work together spirit solidarity, trust understanding. it aim accelerate process economic social development member countries. i believe consideration timeliness introduce common currency region supportive towards objective aim saarc well. while take note deliberation would definitely lay foundation future development saarc region, i take great pleasure inaugurate conference today wish success conference. and i would also like urge take little time visit place interest, beautiful country, sri lanka.

(a) between 1980 2001, south asia receive $17 billion official development assistance (oda). however, 1990 2001 oda inflow decline per caput term well percent gdp. there change composition external capital inflow decline share aid relation type inflows. this change composition suggest influence official donor particularly international financial institution (ifis) thus likely wane future fund managers, rat agencies, equity research houses, investment bank multinational company likely gain ascendancy. thus, credibility economic policy pursue country assume much important role relationship nurture donor ifis. the market’s power penalize imprudent policy breach commitment damage economy slippage observance imf world bank conditionalities. if recall mexico suffer heavily incoming zedillo regime reverse pre-commitment make salina regime market exchange rate. the country witness huge sudden capital outflows, depreciation currency, inflation economic recession. to keep access international financial market south asian country maintain open liberal foreign exchange regimes, sound robust financial sector pursue consistent, credible transparent economic policies. (b) along sound economic policy grow evidence critical role good governance institutional quality growth-poverty reduction nexus. the feature weak governance normally associate south asia corruption, political patronage, lack transparency, low observance rule law, absence level play field, heavy tilt delivery scarce public good service towards privilege elite classes. the political leader begin realize disenchantment electorate poor governance practice increase burden incumbency put survival serious risk. thus, improve governance top agenda political party south asia interest assure electoral sustenance. bureaucratic hassles, long draw procedures, un-even application rule regulations, excessive discretionary power hand low level bureaucracy, shortage essential infrastructure facility low productivity labor force make region attractive place foreign investors. consequently, foreign direct investment (fdi) yet make significant impact economy region. fdi account 0.5% gdp india receive $3-4 billion annually pakistan $1 billion. portfolio investment india take upward trend suffer set back aftermath recent elections. a major overhaul structure civil service, judiciary, police local government institutions, business process re-engineering inculcation modern management practice require country region. (c) political geopolitical risk region still quite elevated. the long stand hostility india pakistan, acquisition nuclear missile capability two country consequential sanction impose upon them, active frontline status pakistan war terrorism, prolong civil war tamil tiger government sri lanka, frequent strike call opposition party government power bangladesh add risk business locate investment countries. the external perception region are, therefore, heavily bias due risks. the sooner overcome problems, good region reliable trade partner, active participant international capital market choice location foreign investment. (d) investment education human development country sri lanka inadequate volume, deficient quality lack relevance. the recent census data 2001 show india’s literacy rate go 64 percent female literacy rate le 50 percent. it also demonstrate least one third population labor force fully equip take ever change complex task economy try outclass compete countries. in pakistan bangladesh almost bi review 50/2004 3 half population two-third female population illiterate. this large proportion woman among illiterate cause serious concern. sri lanka country region almost one hundred percent literacy. but full literacy level raise another stark fact face i.e., grow imbalance demand skill impose market economic force supply skill produce educational institutions. there surfeit highly educate graduate employable shortage worker carry routine technical job production service. india produce good quality science engineer graduate every year cater high end job market lack attention non-university technical education quality create wide gap middle end job market. this situation much aggravate pakistan bangladesh issue quality, relevance number intertwined. sri lanka problem number high level unemployment among university graduate testify mismatch skills. the widespread frustration among parent graduate one hand high level dissatisfaction among employer find right person right job evidence imbalance labor market. (e) this skill imbalance lack employability serious repercussion composition growth basket good exported. the dynamic rapid grow sector export world market today medium term associate high technology extent medium technology. while india make headway increase penetration high technology export record country region promising. they still stick low technology export particularly textile clothe decline share world trade. thus need overcome skill obsolescence turn towards medium high technology export never apparent today. one particular mean change composition export accelerate remove barrier constraint way foreign investor multinational corporation (mncs). fdi important force integration mncs set supply chain integrate production network tend locate stage production country low cost. affiliate mnc one country often export another eventual sale third country market. these affiliate act on-the-job train grind acquisition dissemination skill need production minimize costs. these skill disseminate multiply throughout firm country. (f) there little intra-regional trade-taking place south asia. intraregional trade remain stagnant le 2% total trade last twenty-five years. a study carry pakistan ministry commerce 1996 conclude due low transportation costs, cultural similarity influence taste cause profitable complementarity emerge low transaction costs, economic benefit liberalize trade india outweigh costs. despite this, trade two neighbour country remain negligible. regional trade arrangement make huge difference north america, europe east asia, unsuccessful south asia. the recent attempt revitalize saarc right direction stimulate trade growth extent unleash competition low domestic prices, enable achieve economy scale acquire new technology. safta arrangement successful come year require number important preparatory measures. these describe below: • trade facilitation expeditious border crossings, quick custom clearance, efficient port facilities, improve transport link precede take place simultaneously expansion volume cross border trade. • domestic tax, tariff subsidy policy affect production trade incentive harmonize avoid recurrence trade dispute frequent use anti dump laws. a india provide lot subsidy producer various form shape small country hesitant allow mfn status india. the recourse long negative list restrict volume trade avoid costs. 4 bi review 50/2004 • macroeconomic policy fiscal monetary policy harmonize achieve stable, non-discriminating macroeconomic environment country region • support institution manage facilitate integration, example, set standards, establish regional development fund dispute resolution created. • communication transport infrastructure border country improve upgrade facilitate increase trade factor mobility. • legal regulation investor protection, intellectual property right enforcement, anti-trust law, commercial law, labor relations, financial institution harmonized. • financial market widen regulatory change introduce promote cross-border investment, listings, syndication, bond issues, etc. (g) south asian country tap enormous potential large expatriate population mobilize investment capital, foreign exchange earnings, skilled manpower export ethnic product services. india, pakistan, bangladesh sri lanka together receive $20 billion remittance worker annually contribution domestic capital formation insignificant. unlike overseas chinese community play substantial role foreign direct investment, nonresident indian source, extent, professional, technical managerial skill much term large financial outlays. the non-resident deposit transfer india account miniscule proportion wealth hold abroad. these flow quite stable nature able augment domestic save accelerate pace investment without create future debt obligations. innovative product investment vehicle attract save nonresident south asian encourage help regulatory agencies. south asian country far miss boat become part global value chain participate international supplier chain arrangements. there single business model participate chain many phase transition many mode involvement. for example, joint ventures, franchising, purchase international firms, licensing, sub-contracting, fully own firm, original equipment, manufacturing, original design manufacturing, strategic partnership technology, overseas acquisition equity diverse mean whereby develop country enterprise gain wide access international market level capability, climb technology ladder benefit globalization. east asia major participant global supply chain produce part component variety manufactures. it time south asian country make attempt get engage value chain. finally, i turn impact wto. i wish clear confusion something drastic unexpected unknown go hit u near future due wto. all country region already member organization since 1995 make bind commitment maximum tariffs. in case apply tariff low bind tariffs. in actual practice, south asian country liberalize import flood cheap import china recent years. there could great threat survival domestic industry competition chinese goods. some industrial firm could face onslaught invasion died. others take challenge cut fat, take slack, become cost efficient, improve quality compete new entrants. thus process restructure transition ongoing pose systematic threat industry region. what seem focus upon abolition textile quota multi-fiber agreement adoption new agreement clothe textile january 2005. the impact new pattern textile trade economy south asia region highly vary differentiated. most simulation study model exercise carry world bank, usitc independent consult firm give credence view china follow india pakistan main beneficiary abolition quotas. these country vertically integrate i.e., produce cotton way finishing, dyeing, stitching, etc. enjoy low wage cost low raw material costs. pakistan, example, invest $3 4 billion past five year modernize acquire state-of-the-art machinery produce quality good accord vary specification change demand pattern buyers. on hand bi review 50/2004 5 obvious ready make garment export firm bangladesh sri lanka able survive post 2005 markets. both country seize problem take measure assist firm workers. whatever benefit regional trade block substitute participation multilateral trade arrangements. multilateral arrangement provide much large market exploit several time size regional block, enlarge market access substantially permit wide competition, large scale operation great specialization increase productivity growth. thus successful completion doha development round much interest south asian country deferential impact various country region handle carefully, imaginatively expeditiously. short-term adjustment cost worker business absorb long run interest expansion activity country dynamic comparative advantage. conclusion south asian country undergo remarkable improvement economic landscape last ten year despite many vicissitude shock able maintain positive growth momentum. the challenge come decade however, different nature. while policy reform good management past certainly help internal transformation economy task face leader country formidable. to maximize benefit globalisation thus help reduce incidence poverty future agenda focus good governance institutional reform, investment skilled manpower, shift away low technology exports, align international value chain production, attract foreign private capital flow include expatiate nationals, promote intra-regional trade mitigate political geopolitical risks. 6 bi review 50/2004 m r pridiyathorn devakula: consumer finance open address mr m r pridiyathorn devakula, governor bank thailand, “fitch rating’s annual conference 2004 consumer finance”, bangkok, 16 september 2004. * * * distinguish guests, lady gentleman i would like welcome highly relevant conference consumer finance securitization appropriately organize fitch rat thailand. i would also like show appreciation fitch invite give today’s open remarks. lady gentleman although consumer finance long staple bank west develop economies, still relatively new open frontier thailand. a i think open remarks, i remind two story capture reality impact new world context thailand’s dual economy. it memory since may agree i still young historical anecdotes. a university student 30 ycars ago, i meet two fellow classmate come completely opposite family backgrounds. the first come well-off family supply cars, expensive clothe lot disposable income. tbe second one poor family enough money food public transportation. the wealthy friend graduate college late send u finish bachelor’s degree, second successfully earn bachelor’s degree scholarship graduate school also us. neither man change way live abroad. the first continue unencumbered spend spree cars, expensive apartment, credit cards. the second, studious frugal two, work long hard able bring home master degree time. his hard work ethic stick get older, today one thailand’s successful business entrepreneurs. the person however, leave state without degree trail unpaid credit card bill parent repay. he start work bangkok could stay place long. he start small business loss money ultimately failed. unable change spend habits, sell asset house order make good debts. to day, stable income, must rely kindness people around help. one lesson 1 draw story immature adults, present easy access credit, may form habit spend beyond mean become burden community society. a recent story come mind involve two factory worker earn approximately 6,000 baht per month. both invite apply credit card one sign offer. this worker first use credit card purchase tv set, could easily finance salary. nevertheless, tv follow wash machine motorcycle, eventually push monthly debt payment exceed income. a exhaust savings, could long borrow family friends, belong repossess creditors, finally quit job hope run away remain creditors. the story highlight dangerous combination fabric thai society low-income earner lack financial literacy, ability effectively manage finances, yet high marginal propensity consume. they turn susceptible unknowingly consume beyond means, like previous story, become burden society. that burden intensify difficulty find obtain new employment. this probable risk demand stakeholder take cautious approach ensure quality growth thailand’s consumer finance market. lady gentleman, in reality one type save behavior world, importantly save behavior appropriate developmental need country. in develop economy thailand, customary save behavior save first spend later. bi review 50/2004 1 develop economy benefit type behavior since allow vital investment madc use domestic savings, thereby lessen reliance extemal capital inflow, time promote economically viable savings-investment gap. on hand, save behavior west develop economy tend lean toward spend save later. this type behavior practicable western countrics due many factor sum head high level economic development. the existence social welfare systems, mature capital markets, diversify economy, highly educate workforce factor allow country able grow relatively low save environment. without factors, country could find difficult grow develop without strain finances. come back thailand, possible say widespread usage credit card type consumer loans, expcct thailand’s save behavior become line develop economies. this trend double-edge sword manage carefully cause severe negative savings-investment gap. such predicament worsen thailand’s dependence extcrnal capital inflow historically show ability change direction rapidly jeopardize macroeconomic stability. it thus need economic social development consumer finance expand line domestic savings. lady gentleman, once back regulator’s dilemma regulate without dampen exuberance vitality market. consumer finance need damage long sure individual household prerequisite responsibility, maturity financial literacy manage finances. both service provider regulator must share task address concern issues. lt hop service provider focus improve bottom line also consider social impact business model. through use gimmicks, service provider risk entice under-qualified immature applicant whose inability manage finance exacerbate social cost npls. a such, social impact consideration become embed process determine business strategy consumer finance, service provider could easily address social concern previously mentioned, time secure quality growth consumer finance market. however, understand competition may pressure service provider leave behind social concerns. thus duty regulator issue rule guideline level play field order prevent consumer finance cause unsustainable bubble. the industry already see bank thailand’s foray credit card market rule govern minimum monthly incomc, interest rate ceiling, fee etc. go forward, may come social impact rule minimum age, rule limit number type gimmick currently use somc service provider attract new customers. maintain thailand’s cconomic growth vitality goal u room share, hope work together towards preserve thailand’s exist save culture, order keep integral part thailand’s economic development tomorrow beyond. thank you. 2 bi review 50/2004 kishori j udeshi: development forex market india - review prospect keynote address m kishori j udeshi, deputy governor reserve bank india, 15th forex assembly organise forex association india, colombo, sri lanka, 20 august 2004. grateful acknowledgement input provide smt. shyamala gopinath, executive director shri. g. mahalingam, general manager, department external investment operations. * * * i delight colombo today address 15th national forex assembly. india sri lanka close friendly neighbourly relation especially culturally, century - indeed millennia. on behalf reserve bank india, i bring greet express appreciation warm hospitality host country. rbi always actively participate meet national forex assembly governor deputy governor level. i delight carry forward tradition. be exclusive gather forex market participant region, i think i would use forum share think forum market development india. i aware country unique situation policies. but forex these, could exchange experience mutual benefit. my brief address structure follows: first, i trace important landmark evolution forex market india span roughly three decades. thereafter, i proceed dwell measure market liberalization development include disclosure transparency initiatives. thereafter would coverage institutional development. i conclude address outline task lie ahead u scope interaction among participants. evolution foreign exchange market india the indian forex market owe origin important step rbi take 1978 allow bank undertake intra-day trade foreign exchange. a consequence, stipulation maintain “square” “near square” position comply close business day. during period 1975-1992, exchange rate rupee officially determine rbi term weight basket currency india’s major trade partner significant restriction current account transactions. the initiation economic reform july 1991 saw significant two-step downward adjustment exchange rate rupee july 1 3, 1991 view place appropriate level line inflation differential maintain competitiveness exports. subsequently, follow recommendation high level committee balance payment (chairman:dr c. rangarajan) liberalise exchange rate management system(lerms) involve dual exchange rate mechanism institute march 1992 follow ultimate convergence dual rate effective march 1, 1993(christened modify lerms). the unification exchange rate rupee mark begin era market determine exchange rate regime rupee, base demand supply forex market. it also important step progress towards current account convertibility, finally achieve august 1994 accept article viii article agreement international monetary fund. the appointment expert group foreign exchange (popularly know sodhani committee) november 1994 landmark design foreign exchange market india. the group study market great detail come far reach recommendation develop, deepen widen forex market. in process development forex markets, bank accord significant initiative freedom operate market. to quote important measure relate market development liberalisation, bank allow freedom fix trade limits, permit borrow invest fund overseas market specify limits, accord freedom determine interest rate fcnr deposit within ceiling allow use derivative product asset-liability management purposes. similarly, corporates give flexibility book forward cover base past turnover allow use variety instrument like interest rate currency swaps, caps/collars forward rate agreement international forex market. rupee-foreign currency swap market hedge long term exposure develop substantially last years. bi review 49/2004 1 market profile the indian forex market predominantly transaction base market existence underlie forex exposure generally essential requirement market users. similarly, regulation case require end user repatriate surrender foreign exchange indian forex market. all forex transaction government india rout market except aid transactions. the forex market make authorise dealer (generally banks), intermediary limit authorisation end user viz., individuals, corporates, institutional investor others. market make bank (generally foreign bank new private sector banks) account significant percentage overall turnover market. the average monthly turnover merchant segment forex market increase us$ 40.5 billion 2003-2004 us$ 27.0 billion 2002-2003. in inter-bank segment, turnover move us$ 103 billion 2002-2003 us$ 134.2 billion 2003-2004. consequently, average monthly total turnover increase sharply us$ 174.7 billion 2003-2004 us$ 130 billion previous year. the inter-bank merchant turnover ratio hover range 2.9 –3.9 year. trade financial liberalisation there large empirical literature suggest trade integration benefit large number help promote economic growth. in contrast, recent empirical research unable establish clear link financial integration growth. there therefore consensus among academician policy maker trade liberalisation take precedence financial liberalisation. the rbi approach make distinction among different participant order assess, ongoing basis, gain well vulnerability foreign currency exposure system. in capital account, apart government’s, three balance sheet take account whether resident non-residents : balance sheet households, corporates financial intermediaries. although theory, everything may integrated, phase development, definitely three distinct term immediate reaction market forces. in particular, approach recognise need put place appropriate prudential regulation regard financial intermediary far foreign currency transaction concerned. there virtual unanimity currency mismatch financial intermediary major source risk financial integration mitigate monitor regulation furthermore, currency mismatch corporate sector also source risk financial sector. hence advice bank monitor unhedged exposure borrowers. i would rejig memory bite - ninth forex assembly goa, deputy governor dr.s.s. tarapore allude risk say “banks fis cannot distance risk take corporates risk involuntarily devolve bank lend corporates easily turn npas”. prudential regulation financial sector therefore construe capital controls. this approach reflect recent liberalisation policy external commercial borrowings. the whole process permit external debt may either automatic route non-automatic route, slowly automatic route expand non-automatic route reduced. the recent external commercial borrowing(ecb) policy make clear distinction corporates financial intermediaries. therefore, corporates give freedom borrow automatic route $500 million per year subject certain conditions, different approach adopt financial intermediary interest financial stability regulate access overseas borrow issue guarantees. another example regard overseas investments. to enable corporates become global company overseas investment net worth permit automatic route. they also access ecbs automatic route invest overseas. in regard resident individuals, order provide hassle-free facility make remittance overseas meet current capital account requirements, allow remit annual basis us$ 25000/- mere declaration purpose. 2 bi review 49/2004 disclosure transparency initiative rbi transparent make

in india, foreign exchange dealer association india self-regulatory organisation form authorise dealer play constructive role market development initiate debate important issues, organise train

the intention already indicate move towards desire objective non-disruptive manner possible. 11. continue compliance ‘fit proper’ criterion shareholder director ensure bank ongoing basis subject independent verification rbi felt necessary. how come devise guidelines? apart internal review, scan international practice. international approach internationally, regulatory/supervisory approach evolve cohesive inclusive regulatory paradigm involve three different monitor perspective overall function bank - • enable proactive regulatory supervisory oversight, • internal control vibrant

role business society large. from bank industry perspective, corporate governance involve manner business affair individual institution govern board director senior management, affect banks1: • set corporate objective (including generate economic return owners); • run day-to-day operation business; • consider interest recognise stakeholders; • align corporate activity behaviour expectation bank operate safe sound manner, compliance applicable law regulations; • protect interest depositors. the two major concern arise context corporate governance bank need address (i) concentration ownership (ii) type people control bank. diversify ownership become necessary postulate provide balance stake may possible otherwise, even case vote right limits. a relate concern ‘quality’ control function

clauses, wherever applicable, norm ownership single entity. crossholding amongst bank i.e., acquire share bank another bank, directly indirectly, subject regulatory approval regime thresholds, cases, low non-bank entities. background draft guideline have deal international approach , i would like highlight fact development serve background information seminar. • unlike many countries, various law relate bank india [banking regulation act 1949, bank company (acquisition transfer undertake act, 1970 1980, state bank india act 1955, state bank india (subsidiary banks) act 1959] provide prior approval regulator acquisition significant ownership bank - either public sector private sector. there is, therefore, need articulation policy public interest depositor’s interest. • on february 3, 2004, reserve bank come guideline acknowledgment acquisition transfer share private sector banks. these guideline take account emerge trend bank international practices. for first time, spell term ‘holding’ refer direct indirect, beneficial otherwise compute reference hold applicant, relative associates. • on 5 march 2004, press note 4 issue government india cover foreign investment banking. the operational guideline yet issued. hence draft guideline cover policy regard investment foreign bank form presence foreign bank separate guidelines. before issue these, 4 bi review 49/2004 felt necessary streamline national policy ownership, domestic foreign, governance. • on june 25 2004, ‘fit proper’ criterion director private sector bank spell rbi base qualification, expertise, track

acquisition, invest bank’s/fi’s hold exceed 5 per cent investee bank’s equity capital. why guideline make applicable exist banks? the bank sector already quite large widespread. there several bank vary sizes, composition shareholding directors. the issue size governance extremely important point view financial stability. this draft policy consonance treat bank special set upfront road map transparent manner exist investor align policy potential investor make inform decisions. the intention policy ensure adequate capital consolidation bank industry regulator aware intention exist potential shareholders. since one fundamental presumption policy shareholding 10 per cent would satisfy regulator fit proper status sound governance principle continue basis, necessary principle applicable exist owner do non-disruptive consultative fashion. in regard bank permit recently rehabilitate recently basis specific approvals, commitment make part approval process would undoubtedly take account also continue compliance ‘fit proper’ sound governance. the criterion applicable high level ownership articulate february 3, 2004 would form basis deal case transition well. the discussion paper illustration consultative process increasingly adopt policy make reserve bank. a far bank business concerned, appreciate role promoter general strategic investor particular; although

player understand market always perfect sometimes justifiable need intervene order correct market. in order u appreciate exchange rate today, let u look movement exchange rate last fourteen years. in 1990, average nad/us$ exchange rate nad2.59 average inflation 15%. by 2000 exchange rate depreciate 100% nad6.87. in 2002 exchange rate reach record low nad10.52. during 2003 exchange rate start appreciate people expect appreciation, expect depreciation. because mismatch expectation transpired, effect appreciate exchange rate make sound much bad really is. those argue monetary authority something depreciate currency, suggest two methods. firstly say central bank reduce interest rate secondly central bank could buy us$. with first method, local currency become le attractive le fund flow local economy hopefully translate weak exchange rate. this sound well may work long inflation keep check. the last think want reduce interest rate without reference inflation, force hike interest rate soon afterwards. we also notice last year monetary authority reduce interest rate, capital continue flow south african capital market exchange rate continue appreciate. clearly, cut interest rate effective way move exchange rate. the option buy foreign currency also appeal downside handle properly. when buy foreign currency, ultimate effect would inject local market equivalent amount local currency. give prevail liquidity position market, injection liquidity market might remove cost, give current interest rate differential, cost could high 8%. you also probably aware experience central bank waste huge amount financial resource try defend desire exchange rate. the result case speculation currencies. it therefore cost-free exercise say central bank must buy us$. an important issue therefore whether policymakers respond exchange rate movement formulate monetary policy. there ample evidence suggest central bank respond either appreciation depreciation transmit unnecessary volatility inflation therefore real economy. in view, recognize fact exchange rate mechanically relate interest rate. the exchange rate subject shock shock indication exchange rate convey information right. it also mean exchange rate impact economy apart come response shift monetary policy instrument. here i suggest exchange rate important factor consider monetary policy actions. indeed, exchange rate important price information economy policymakers form view movement exchange rate part holistic bi review 49/2004 1 approach policy setting. however, must avoid oversimplification linkage exchange rate interest rate. a relate question ask whether country prefer weak strong exchange rate. the general answer usually go like this: mostly export country, prefer weak exchange rate competitive term price. on hand, mostly import country, prefer strong exchange rate, account price competitiveness. to mind, generalize answer, best, leaf number realities. for example weak currency generally associate expectation high inflation. we also well aware danger inflation therefore rely weak exchange rate price competitiveness may beneficial short term. for long term prosperity country good rely total factor productivity levels. lastly, lady gentlemen, i want answer question i asked: “are economic reason celebrate strong nad?” my short answer question maybe maybe not. i thank you. 2 bi review 49/2004 shkëlqim cani: review albanian economy statement dr shkëlqim cani, governor bank albania, euromoney yearbooks, global bank financial policy review, tirana, 9 august 2004. * * * the albanian economy experience recover pulse economic growth year 2003. positive development mark respect consolidate country’s macroeconomic stability, economic growth sound development financial

concern perspective inflation conclude remark dr y v reddy, governor reserve bank india, institute development research bank technology (idrbt), hyderabad, 27 august 2004. * * * dear shri bajpaiji, shri c. s. rao garu, shri kamesam, dr. gulati friends, at outset, i thankful institute invite function give pleasure all. the programme clearly say i give conclude remarks. this make clear presence essentially ceremonial - hand certificate bright young people give remarks, basically perhaps reserve bank india (rbi) fund institute. i think wise thing institute development research bank technology (idrbt) express thank fund cultivate matter. i will, however, take opportunity make comment current concern inflation. financial regulation to begin with, comment address deliver today reference idrbt. shri c. s. rao, chairman, insurance regulatory development authority (irda) emphasise synergy develop bank insurance. there two element - one macro-side operational micro-side. india’s contractual save long-term save rather low, able invest heavily infrastructure, macro part insurance critical role. the second part much business country really cover insurance. the growth economic activity require risk-mitigation classic case agriculture india. so don’t risk mitigation measures, capacity increase economic activity get constrained. we pride financial sector reform india start early reform cycle, within financial sector, insurance reform come rather late cycle. hence, enormous scope expansion area. shri rao’s focus link bank insurance sector, take advantage penetration bank already rural areas, remarkable approach admittedly, extremely useful use technology process. we work i sure banks, especially public sector banks, great business potential bankassurance. shri bajpai, chairman, security exchange board india (sebi) cover address historical perspective cross-country perspective. a compare countries, extent progress make security regulator term technology penetration safety measure impressive currently, absolutely world class. sebi proud that. a go along, need abreast global development time integrate unique socio-economic circumstances. there two issue - one operational level overall stability issue regard role financial regulator - counts, large, every reason proud achievements. we withstand external domestic challenge well economic political one last ten years. india emerge 1990s, island financial stability sea turbulence among emerge market credit go participant venture improve financial system. on idrbt a regard activity idrbt, herald customer-centric national switch atms. this, i believe, facilitate access large number atm different banks. idrbt take major step herald it revolution financial sector brief span eight years. another excellent initiative university-industry collaboration m.tech. programme pgpbtm programme significant contributions. undoubtedly, idrbt proper balance research, train it infrastructure provision benefit financial sector whole. india boast excellence development computer software, entire world’s financial sector source software bangalore, hyderabad, pune, etc. perhaps, bi review 49/2004 1 merit try get advantage expertise provide various centres. idrbt play role create forum software industry hardware industry set global standard able serve financial sector domestically also. and whatever try do, careful quality service hop idrbt introduce, already introduced, also upgrade mechanism assessment quality service idrbt providing. rbi technology some mention rbi’s work regard technology order forum. an important contribution rbi development technology indeed establishment institute. the major achievement last one-year real time gross settlement (rtgs). between timetable make sure work right, give preference make sure work right result delay large track. within three month introduction rtgs, system able settle almost 90% inter-bank fund transfer, early rout net-settlement base inter-bank clear mumbai. the year also witness introduction call special electronic fund transfer (seft), provide transfer fund electronic mode day basis multiple daily settlements. the rtgs seft together able cover 2500 branch bank around 200 cities. no doubt, still lot scope improvement. it appropriate mention item rbi’s agenda technology matters. one course expansion reach rtgs important make sure increase reach also work well. secondly, national electronic fund transfer need connect almost branch country use sfms infinet. the third enhance level security payment settlement system. we accord high priority security it-related matters, particularly financial sector, inter-related security breach one place, quite possible spread areas. the fourth relate conduct clear settlement national level national settlement system. introduction cheque truncation system pilot basis national capital region important task. there also proposal relate risk mitigation scheme defer net settlement system. in regard, also pursue idea semi-autonomous board payment settlements. ultimately, separate legislation govern payment settlement system. to provide roadmap attain goals, rbi decide start preparation new vision document technology. the new vision document encompass consolidation progress make also show way forward. a soon preliminary draft prepared, able submit group multi-disciplinary professionals, user-side technology-side invite advice guidance. this vision document put public domain draft stage itself. on current macroeconomic situation in view widespread interest current inflationary environment, i make brief presentation current macro-economic situation particular reference inflation. if recall, week ago i make brief statement concern relate inflation. at stage, submit global domestic factor working, predominantly global domestic factor - drive current inflation. i also mention supply demand factor rise headline inflation predominantly result supply-shock. in term policy response indicate (a) monitor development carefully; (b) respond development ongoing basis view ensure price stability. this good statement today week ago. but certain development since then, duty place you. first, number fiscal action take particular relate oil. the impact, may find impact action today tomorrow, clear determine fiscal response initiate continue necessary. this help contain inflationary expectations. 2 bi review 49/2004 second, new development indian situation. it corporate house take upon importance maintain certain amount price stability. the industry trade take initiative term look may call broad interest. in term price power, occasion corporate sector may use full price power short-run gain immediate advantage keep view long term perspective. this realisation evident among corporates i sure happen among large trade community also. these attitude action contribute moderate inflationary outcome and, importantly, expectations. third, series discussion recent past financial industry association lead bankers. we extremely fruitful discussion major advice come forward bank community financial sector try reduce volatility. all agree interest everybody minimise volatility financial market public policy minimise knee-jerk reactions, focus price stability underlie inflation. fourth, domestic circumstance, truckers’ strike fear strike add inflation. it must recognise may increase number relate headline inflation weeks. i would, however, describe truckers’ strike nature “temporary supply disruption certain localities” rather something influence inflationary expectation approach price stability. it distinction require analyse type policy responses. fifth, far financial market concerned, money market reasonably stable forex market also stable. in government security market, however, certain concerns. the rbi aware situation market participant make several suggestion minimise volatility adverse impact, examine operational level. we rbi try see avoidable uncertainty policy, mitigate undue pressure function market without undermine market efficiency. positive get positive but this, true concern current rise headline inflation, forget positive side, view, positive side seem get bite positive last two-to-three weeks. how so? first foremost, virtually national consensus high inflation good bring down. whether political leadership, whether economic agents, whether bankers, whether regulator - among everybody national consensus good persistent high price everybody consider common long-term interest maintain price stability. so, national consensus issue several action follow section wherever warrant knee-jerk reactions. second, good news, sense generally india democratic pressure ensure inflation doesn’t go two-digit mark. but now, find inflation tolerance come down. the society, economic agent market participant react low headline inflation, good thing want sustain strong growth, necessary rein inflationary expectations. it necessary ensure price stability best way ensure price stability? everybody work towards goal include rbi possible consensus regard. there virtual national consensus today tolerance inflation come definitely people unhappy high must bring level soon possible. this indeed good news economic agent factor consensus possible factor govern future policy expectation relate price stability. third, change scenario interest rate also good news. for long, plan system administer interest rate amount comfort everyone. in last five six years, reduction interest rates. a interest rate go recent years, fully sensitive fact something know interest rate cycles. so, first time, market participant get feel interest rate cycle. no doubt, rbi mention analysis, many look like usual central bank analysis caution - like grandfather always caution careful cross road. bi review 49/2004 3 but reality reform process interest rate cycle even within overall stable situation consistent overall macro-stability. that cycle experience market participant first time, result market participant able input uncertainty consciously factor type risk face conduct business. so central bank’s point view, endeavour facilitate - endeavour say tell - new environment work together see appropriate system withstand interest rate cycle consciously built. in meet banker couple day ago, le come round view system make get accustom interest rate cycles. fourth, prospect real sector look better. in current fiscal, term numbers, investment activity pick whether one talk capital good imports, one talk capital good production. the off-take non-food credit fiscal impressive. these development mean output normal course grow. so, output likely grow next month many way time-frame look regard price levels. one recognise ultimately inflation result interplay supply side productivity, quantum output investment activities, demand side. so, i would consider supply side domestically positive. fifth, positive, export grow impressively. we usually worry oil bill go export also go so, least impact balance payment much would apprehended. hence, le uncomfortable face oil price hikes. analytics policy response in background, useful look analytics govern policy response. a international domestic factor influence current tendency rise headline inflation country, international factor continue dominant. the international factor relate primarily oil also, extent, commodity financial markets, include interest rate exchange rates. at time, positive development domestic front. these relate improve outlook monsoon pick investment activity. clearly, therefore, dominance international factor current price rise importance stability govern domestic economy continue warrant measure response ensure price stability contain inflationary expectations. a supply demand factors, evidence clearly continue increase inflation largely account supply shock. a regard demand factors, growth broad money well reserve money moderated. there evidence gradual unwind overhang liquidity. there may transient impact truckers’ strike inflation need treat last supply shock. in case, clear evidence aggravation demand side. on balance, therefore, situation watch carefully term balance supply demand factors, current situation seem much different diagnose time ago, viz., significantly supply side shock. a regard inflationary expectations, new dimension understand inflation itself. there recently sophisticate debate issue appropriate index inflation. analyst point wholesale price index (wpi) india similar producers’ price index country countries, headline inflation usually consumer price index (cpi). more important, internationally, empirical evidence show wholesale price producers’ index tend volatile. it may necessary capture nuance relationship policy response context inflationary expectations. it interest recall experience rise headline inflation divergence wpi cpi country. over last five year average wpi inflation, weekly basis, 4.6 per cent cpi inflation low 3.9 per cent, monthly basis. in recent years, year-on-year wpi inflation rate high range 6.0-9.0 per cent part 2000-01. again, inflation remain high range 6.0-7.0 per cent sometime 2003-04. a inflationary episode consider largely cause supply side factors, inflation rate reverse quickly supply situation stabilised. while headline inflation respond supply shock demand pressures, nature response could quite 4 bi review 49/2004 different. the response inflation supply shock quick transient. the response demand shock hand, subtle persistent. a indicate annual monetary credit policy statement year 2001-02, factor complicate conduct monetary policy certain period difficulty correct assessment potential inflationary pressure base available data current period. while uncertainties, perhaps useful look recent inflation history assessment inflationary expectations. the monetary policy stance country also try respond oil price shock. in many country shift monetary policy stance easy neutral one. in countries, little evidence cognisable monetary policy response oil price hike per se. in view linkage domestic international economy, monetary policy response countries, particularly develop ones, also carefully watched. most important, reassurance context current rise inflation side, viz., side price stability. the fiscal authorities, monetary policy, financial market corporates commit objective price stability minimise volatility. in background, therefore, rbi continue dialogue market participant fine tune response minimise volatility emphasise importance reserve bank’s credibility maintain price stability consistent compulsion growth dynamic country juncture. thank you. bi review 49/2004 5 alan greenspan: economic outlook testimony mr alan greenspan, chairman board governor u federal reserve system, committee budget, u house representatives, washington, 8 september 2004. * * * mr. chairman member committee, i please today offer view state u.s. economy current fiscal issues. i speak necessarily federal reserve. a know, economic activity hit soft patch late spring grow briskly second half 2003 first part 2004. consumer spend slow materially, employment gain moderate notably mark step-up early spring. that softness activity doubt related, large measure, year’s steep increase energy prices. the recent data suggest that, whole, expansion regain traction. consumer spend house start bounce back july weak performance june, although early read retail sale august mixed. in addition, business investment remain solid upward trend. in manufacture sector, output continue move recent months, though part rise likely reflect increase inventory investment. in labor market, though job gain small last spring, nonfarm payroll employment growth pick back august. despite rise oil price mid-august, inflation inflation expectation ease recent months. to sure, unit labor cost rise second quarter productivity growth slow extraordinary pace past two year employee compensation per hour remain upward trend. but, best judge, growth profit margin non-energy, nonfinancial, corporations, which, least account perspective, contribute significantly price pressure earlier, recently slowed. moreover, increase non-oil import price lessen - development that, couple slow profit-margin growth, help low core consumer price inflation recent months. * * * movement energy price major influence overall inflation year. in second quarter, gasoline price rise rapidly mark pickup gasoline demand strain refinery capacity result sharply high profit margins. in may june, refinery market margin rise level 25 cent 30 cent per gallon typical spread go summer drive season. a consequence steep run-up prices, demand gasoline eased, accompany increase inventory help reverse bulge occur refinery market margins. that reduction margin result decline price regular gasoline 20 cent per gallon despite concurrent sharp rise price crude oil. with margin return more-typical levels, price gasoline home heat oil likely reflect change crude oil price directly. * * * evaluate impact rise oil price economic activity unite state long subject dispute among economists. most macroeconomic model treat increase oil price tax u.s. resident sap purchase power household raise cost businesses. but economist disagree size effects, part difference key assumption employ statistical model underlie analyses. moreover, model typically base average historical experience, dominate period moderate fluctuation oil price thus may adequately capture adverse effect economy oil price spikes. in addition difficulty measure impact oil price economic growth, oil price outlook uncertain. grow concern long-term security oil production middle east, along heighten worry reliability supply oil-producing regions, lead pronounce increase demand hold inventory time level world commercial oil stock bi review 49/2004 1 rise modestly. some increase demand come investor speculator take large net long position crude oil futures, especially distantly date contracts. crude oil price accordingly rise sharply, which, turn, bring forth increase production opec induce investor take profit long inventory positions. the result reduction speculative demand inventory has, least temporarily, reduce pressure markets, crude price come high mid-august. nevertheless, outlook oil price remain uncertain. high price damp consumption oil - example, u.s. gasoline consumption, seasonally adjusted, fell 200,000 barrel day april july. but grow concern long-term supply, along large prospective increase demand rapidly grow economy china india, expand way relatively energy intensive, propel price distant future level well range recent years. meanwhile, despite paucity new discovery major oil fields, improve technology significantly increase ultimate recovery oil already exist fields. during past decade, despite 250 billion barrel oil extract worldwide, net prove reserve rise well excess 100 billion barrels. that is, gross addition reserve significantly exceed extraction oil reserve replaced. indeed, field where, two decade ago, roughly one-third oil place ultimately could extracted, almost half appear recoverable today. gain prove reserve concentrate among opec members, though prove reserve unite states, essentially offshore, rise 3-1/2 percent past five years. the uptrend prove reserve likely continue least awhile. oil service firm continue report significant involvement reservoir extension enhancement. nevertheless, future balance supply demand remain precarious, incentive oil consumer develop economy decrease oil intensity economy doubtless continue. presumably similar development emerge large oil-consuming develop economies. * * * the remainder remark address federal budget, incoming data suggest unify deficit recently level out. with economy continue improve, deficit likely decline increase year ahead. nonetheless, prospect federal budget long term remain troubling. a yet, concern budget appear leave noticeable imprint financial markets. in recent years, even fiscal discipline eroded, imply one-year forward treasury rate long horizons, history suggest sensitive change fiscal outlook, hold fairly steady. various measure long-term real interest rate also remain moderate level period. these developments, however, warrant complacency fiscal outlook. with baby boomer start retire year health spend continue soar, budget position almost surely deteriorate substantially come year current policy remain place. the enormous improvement federal budget balance second half 1990s early current decade due importantly rapid growth labor productivity period, led, directly indirectly, vast but, retrospect, temporary increase revenues. the budget enforcement act (bea) 1990, late modification extension act, almost surely contribute good budget outcome well, brief emergence surplus erode adhere deficit-containment rules. the key provision bea expire 2002, replacement adopted. reinstatement structure like bea would signal renew commitment fiscal restraint would help restore discipline annual budget process. but would part meaningful endeavor establish framework fiscal policy choices. the bea design constrain legislative action new initiatives. it contain provision deal unanticipated budgetary outcome time. it also design centerpiece longer-run budget policy; importantly, bea set clear objective toward fiscal policy aim. budget outcome next decade deviate, always projection - perhaps, significantly. accordingly, would quite helpful mechanism place assist congress make mid-course correction needed. four five decade ago, mechanism 2 bi review 49/2004 unnecessary, part much budget determine annual basis. indeed, 1960s, discretionary spending, subject annual appropriation process thus come regular review congress, account two-thirds total outlays. that share drop markedly 1970s 1980s spend retirement, medical, entitlement program rise sharply. in early 1990s, fell 40 percent, remain past decade. the rise share expenditure subject annual review complicate task make fiscal policy effectively necessitate extension budget plan horizon. in 1960s early 1970s, president’s budget provide information mainly upcoming fiscal year. the 1974 legislation establish new budget process create congressional budget office require cbo provide five-year budget projections. by mid-1990s, cbo’s projection horizon push ten years. give change composition outlays, long plan horizon associate budget projection essential step toward allow congress balance budget priority sensibly. among things, change make budget process reliant forecasting. to sure, forecast become sophisticate statistical technique economic model evolved. but increase complexity markets, inaccuracy forecast - especially go beyond near term - large problem. a well-designed set measure mid-course correction would likely include regular assessment exist program verify continue meet state purpose cost projections. although vast majority exist program would doubtless extend routinely, face appreciable opposition offer limit societal benefit might clear hurdle set congress unamended, all. more generally, mechanisms, triggers, bring budget back line go track considered, particularly measure force mid-course correction estimate future cost program tax provision exceed specify threshold. i mean suggest budget problem solve simply adopt set budget rule restrain new legislation - even rule augment effective mechanism make mid-course corrections. the fundamental challenge face come grip adverse budgetary implication age population current health entitlement limit ability project likely path medical outlays. the rapid increase revenue 1990s significantly mute necessity make choice high-priority tax spend initiatives. in context unprecedented increase retirees, need make stark choice among budget priority become pressing. federally fund access advance medical technology, example, likely weigh spend program well tax initiative foster increase economic growth revenue base. because baby boomer yet start retire force accordingly ratio retiree worker remain relatively low, demographic lull. but short outsized acceleration structural productivity major expansion immigration, state relative tranquility soon end. in 2008 - four year - lead edge baby-boom generation reach 62, early age social security retirement benefit may claim age half prospective beneficiary retire recent years. in 2011, individual reach 65 thus eligible medicare. the pressure federal budget demographic change come top stem relentless upward trend expenditure medical care. indeed, outlay medicare medicaid grow much fast nominal gdp recent years, significant slow seem offing. in 2003, outlay social security medicare amount 7 percent gdp; accord programs’ trustees, 2030 ratio nearly double. moreover, projection subject considerable uncertainty, especially medicare. unlike social security, benefit tie mechanical fashion retirees’ wage history useful tool forecast future benefits, possible variance medical spend rise dramatically move next decade beyond. a social security, forecast number medicare beneficiary reasonably straightforward. but know little rapidly medical technology continue advance innovation translate future spending. technological innovation greatly improve quality medical care can, instances, reduce cost bi review 49/2004 3 exist treatments. but technology expand set treatment possibilities, also potential add overall spend - cases, great deal. other source uncertainty - example, long life expectancy among elderly affect medical spend - may also turn important. a result, range future possible outlay per recipient extremely wide. develop way deal uncertainty major part effective budget strategy long run. critical evaluation possibility that, nation, may already make promise come generation retiree unable fulfill. if, study, possibility turn case, imperative make clear real resource available citizen properly plan retirements. this problem raise more-general principle public policy prudence. if, history strongly suggests, entitlement benefit tax credits, bestowed, difficult repeal, consideration give develop framework recognize potential asymmetry. * * * re-establishing effective procedural framework budgetary decisionmaking high priority. but start. a prepare retirement baby-boom generation confront implication soar expenditure medical care, major effort policymakers set priority tax spend program start make tradeoff long overdue. the significant improvement budget 1990s reflect persistent effort part committee others. if similar effort make now, assist prepare economy fiscal challenge face year ahead. 4 bi review 49/2004 jean-claude trichet: european economy - current state prospect keynote address mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, annual dinner 2004 financial service ireland (fsi), dublin, 23 september 2004. * * * i honour invite today. i would like thank you, mr chairman, executive board financial service ireland invitation, give opportunity share view state european economy prospect future. i like first discus current economic financial situation euro area prospect future, i focus condition need place ensure sustainable growth, include role fiscal policy. current economic situation future prospect let start describe current economic financial situation. the late data release confirm economic recovery euro area continuing. real gdp grow 0.5% quarter quarter second quarter year, record 0.6% increase first quarter. moreover, late indicator output demand remain consistent ongoing growth real activity. look ahead, condition continuation broaden recovery remain place. economic growth outside euro area continue robust, continue support euro area export growth. on domestic side, investment benefit positive global environment favourable finance conditions. improvement corporate efficiency high profit also support business investment. moreover, private consumption continue gradual recovery, broadly line growth real disposable income which, usual lag, underpin increase employment growth late on. against background, economic recovery euro area expect continue become broadly base come quarters, lead somewhat strong upswing course 2005. i note scenario ongoing progress economic recovery is, always, subject risk - directions. on upside, ongoing momentum recovery may imply positive development economic growth come quarters. on downside, still concern continue economic imbalance part world. these imbalance could affect sustainability economic recovery. another downside risk growth projection relate oil prices. if remain high currently expect markets, would dampen foreign domestic demand. in assess real risk stem oil prices, one nevertheless take account that, express euro, recent rise oil price significantly small previous oil shocks, example, 1973, 1979 2000 oil price increase major impact world economy. in addition, real terms, oil price significantly peak reach past. moreover, compare 1970s 1980s, oil intensity production euro area elsewhere fall significantly. in 2001, energy intensity euro area, measure energy consumption tonne oil equivalent, relation real gdp, decrease around 50%, compare peak recover 1973. that said, i echo call oil producer responsible require situation present juncture global economy. turn price developments, recent oil price development visible direct impact euro area inflation. the annual hicp inflation august 2.3%, unchanged july. on basis current market expectation oil prices, appear unlikely annual inflation rate return level 2% remainder year, begin next year. look ahead, however, indication present strong underlie inflationary pressure build domestically. recent wage development moderate, trend expect continue time come view continue high level unemployment bi review 53/2004 1 euro area. if case, provide one-off shock price source see 2004 repeated, annual inflation rate drop 2% 2005. however, several upward risk projection inflation. concern relate particular oil price developments, may continue visible impact inflation. oil price rise also imply risk second-round effect emerge wage price-setting, risk intensify economic upswing strengthens. a upward risk relate future evolution indirect tax administer prices, little specific information currently available 2005 beyond. all all, available indicator consistent price stability maintain medium-term, number upside risk need monitor closely. cross-check regular monetary analysis indicate substantially liquidity euro area need finance non-inflationary growth. this also support case strong vigilance regard materialisation risk price stability. have give overview current state euro area economy, prospect near future, i would like address condition need place ensure sustainable growth. condition sustainable growth the key achievement maintenance strong growth europe require perspective extend beyond shorter-term cyclical developments. there urgent need promote growth-orientated economics strategies, include stimulation productivity employment rates, within framework sound fiscal macroeconomic policies. it widely recognise accelerate implementation structural reform, frame within lisbon agenda, key make eu economy competitive dynamic. structural reform design increase flexibility markets, open path achieve high sustainable growth, increase employment, promote innovation secure sustainability social security system eu. tackle structural problem european labour market essential process. particularly difficult challenge europe include reduce high level structural unemployment, include youth unemployment, increase relatively low level labour market participation, particularly old workers, persist european labour markets. overall, quite distance bridge europe reach one key goal set lisbon agenda, namely employment rate 70%. some country start undertake need reform social security system reduce disincentive work currently create within many european labour markets. unemployment scheme amend early retirement incentive reduced. but progress type necessary attract people labour market, particularly europe’s population become old face demographic change. here remarkable experience ireland provide strongly positive example. ireland’s economic success link successful transformation labour market plentiful supply competitively price quality labour resources. it experience demonstrate policy increase flexibility labour market bring opportunity long term positive effect growth performance. strong product market competition also central instrument boost growth europe. eu countries, include ireland, make significant progress product market reform 1990s, positive effect integration level competition good markets, barrier competition innovation europe remain, urgently need tackled. ireland’s experience show reduction barrier internal market, particular service network industries, essential promote effective competition across europe. the reduction red-tape order enhance productivity, job creation good use information technology another priority. attention also pay share eu internal market legislation yet implement national laws. finally much progress achieve capital market reforms, least due introduction euro. whilst country financial market function well, still market segregation. the completion financial service action plan need promote pan-european competition consolidate restructure financial sector. a recent study, example, find overall level eu-wide real gdp may increase 1% decade 2 bi review 53/2004 result integration, employment would also benefit. the integration national capital market towards truly european financial market could also make important contribution safeguard country-specific shocks. another ireland’s success - premier host country foreign investment - suggest effort also make promote foreign investment financial market euro area, order attract additional capital promote great transfer technology. let explain we, ecb, keep stress importance implement structural reform. confidence among european citizen vital strong economic recovery sustain growth. successful structural reform credibly reduce disincentive work, invest innovate could significant confidence effects, even short run. the impetus determine structural reform capital, labour product market would set motion virtuous circle increase confidence: credible reform are, confidence create, confidence created, sooner positive result visible. to conclude structural reforms, i think key issue put promise reform practice - bridge gap strategy implementation europe - identify best policy practice make structural reform happen. we consensus “road map”. the issue today improve “navigation”, streamline decision make process effective delivery reforms. convince people europe country good thank reform absolutely key. it clear implement effectively necessary reform would real challenge challenge require win heart trust people europe. fiscal policy implement structural reform raise potential growth major challenge face european governments. but one. achieve sustainable, non-inflationary growth also require strong commitment fiscal discipline. in economy, absence fiscal discipline, price stability maintain high cost term interest rates, thereby growth employment. by contrast, sound public finance facilitate task central bank strengthen condition price stability, lead good ex post policy mix favourable finance condition thereby contribute higher, non-inflationary growth. but important monetary union, without federal budget area-wide level. a credible reliable framework ensure fiscal discipline level monetary union key component consistency cohesion union. sound fiscal policy necessary avoid negative spill effect term interest rate increase could cause one country group country run large budget deficits. reach safe budgetary position good time necessary ensure fiscal policy room cope asymmetric shocks, long address monetary policy. not least reasons, matter concern ecb number member state struggle live commitment fiscal discipline. in view recent difficulties, commission table proposal discussion launch consider strengthen clarify implementation stability growth pact. of course ecb party pact decision area responsibility government central banks. but since fiscal policy matter monetary policy, central banker affect consider appropriate give advice. we find common grind commission’s proposal thinking, namely, regard preventive arm pact. we agree implementation stability growth pact improved. we agree ownership incentive compliance need enhanced. and agree implement pact way best reflect economic rationale help achieve end. at time, wary excessive complexity relaxation rules. in particular so-called “corrective arm” pact must fully preserve nominal anchor 3%. the stability growth pact require simple transparent rule order facilitate effective monitoring; provide effective deterrence unsound policies; end day, provide anchor long-term expectations, result clarity, simplicity credibility framework. in respect, stick assessment word treaty regulation stability growth pact appropriate current form changed. bi review 53/2004 3 let add one word regard current discussion stability growth pact. some proponent reform - - argue need focus growth, contradiction fiscal soundness growth job creation. on contrary, economic theory empirical observation support idea wise fiscal policy foster sustainable growth job creation. there good example ireland where, second half 1980s, vigorous fiscal consolidation accompany acceleration economic activity. indeed, experience ireland suggest that, needed, credible well design fiscal consolidation support economic growth medium long term perspective also short-run. conclusion lady gentlemen, let conclude two remark could sum two word : confidence conviction. confidence first. we know euro area considerable potential, progressively materialize period come. the present gradual recovery underway condition progressively broadly based. in present juncture confidence essence. the degree confidence economic constituencies, households, savers, entrepreneur investor key factor foster growth job creation. a central bank anchor confidence. we, ecb eurosystem, necessary preserve consolidate confidence: confidence currency, confidence capacity deliver price stability, confidence stability monetary financial environment. and conviction. we, ecb eurosystem, convince fully enhance express growth potential euro area call reform implemented. we support government parliament embark structural reforms. i know reform neither easy decide easy put place decided. they need great deal courage determination, particularly general public yet fully convince necessary. the sentiment public large decisive democracy. this i think appropriate pedagogy tireless explanation important ever convince fellow citizen europe reform pay everyone would good off, thank reforms. we part large, public explanation endeavour. the ultimate conviction people europe, fellow citizens, essence. and dublin best capital europe stress point, visible tangible level prosperity quantity job reform help delivering. i thank attention. 4 bi review 53/2004 svein gjedrem: the conduct monetary policy introductory statement mr svein gjedrem, governor norge bank (central bank norway), hear stand committee finance economic affair storting (norwegian parliament), oslo, 28 september 2004. the text may differ slightly actual presentation. the statement based, among things, assessment norge bank’s annual report 2003 inflation report 2/2004. the chart pdf-format find norge bank’s website. * * * i would like take opportunity thank storting invite norge bank appear committee report answer question monetary policy connection storting’s deliberation government’s credit report. inflation-targeting country price stability, sense low stable inflation, objective monetary policy number countries. historical experience norway country show high inflation result unstable output employment. in addition, fall price level often accompany period decline. the first inflation target introduce new zealand 1990. canada follow 1991, uk 1992, sweden australia 1993. in norway, government issue regulation introduce inflation target 2001. monetary policy euro area country switzerland also aim price stability, even though refer inflation target countries. inflation target prove particularly appropriate open small medium-sized economies. commodity export play particularly important role several country first introduce inflation targeting. exchange rate fluctuate over past 10-15 years, many country make transition fix exchange rate regime inflation targeting. in open economy free capital movements, exchange rate influence economic developments. the krone fluctuates. this surprise countries’ currency also fluctuate. the krone exchange rate stand particularly unstable compare countries’ currencies. the krone exchange rate price currency measure foreign currency. development country important krone development norwegian economy. capital flow freely flow change rapidly. this spill exchange rate interest rate well output employment. there cost involve business hedge fluctuation krone. a krone stable - strong - also entail cost economy form low activity. similarly, krone stable - weak - source high inflation. flexible inflation target the important contribution monetary policy make sound economic development long term low stable inflation. the inflation target provide anchor economic agents’ expectation concern future inflation. we open economy free capital movements. stable inflation expectation also contribute stable exchange rate expectations. inflation target mean set interest rate achieve numerical target inflation. norge bank set interest rate view stabilise inflation 2.5 per cent within reasonable bi review 53/2004 1 time horizon, normally 1-3 years. the precise horizon depend disturbance economy exposed, affect path inflation output. the inflation target represent framework for, obstacle to, monetary policy’s contribution stabilise output employment. we choose flexible inflation targeting. variability output employment well inflation give weight. the objective monetary policy safeguard value money long term, seek contribute stabilise economic development short medium term. like central banks, norge bank publish report economic situation, inflation outlook conduct monetary policy. the transparency basis monetary policy decision increased. norge bank present account main aspect economic development influence interest rate decision executive board’s assessments. the alternative consider executive board make public. interest rate decision take basis interest-rate set strategy draw executive board every four months. the strategy publish soon adopt prior relevant strategy period. the interest rate affect economy lag the objective monetary policy low stable inflation. the instrument interest rate. the interest rate influence inflation lag vary intensity. a interest rate fall, household local government consumption investment tend accelerate. high demand lead high output employment. wage growth may pick up. high wage growth combine high profit margin result high inflation. low interest rate normally lead depreciation krone. import good become expensive inflation accelerate. expectation play key role price wage formation, influence interest rate. expectation concern future inflation economic stability considerable impact, least foreign exchange market. more stable inflation current inflation low, recent history show without nominal anchor inflation become high variable substantial effect output employment. in 1970s 1980s, average annual inflation norway eight per cent. the fix exchange rate regime, introduce 1986, reinstate monetary policy instrument economic policy norway lay foundation low inflation stable economic developments. like small, open commodity economies, norway also experience possible maintain stable exchange rate nominal anchor. inflation target therefore introduce 2001. high variable inflation usually accompany instability output employment. but inflation low time either. this partly structure economy evolve time. demand labour different qualification changes. restructure require change real wage relative wages. nominal wage readily fall. with measure inflation, real wage relative wage change without reduce nominal wages. some degree inflation oil economic machinery. in periods, appropriate stimulate economy low, even negative, real interest rates. if inflation become entrench low level, interest rate le effective instrument cannot set zero. if economy expose unexpected negative disturbances, little scope manoeuvre. stability output employment in long term, output employment determine supply labour, capital technology ability adapt. monetary policy contribute smooth fluctuation output employment. norge bank weigh stable inflation stable output employment. 2 bi review 53/2004 the output gap measure difference actual level output potential output. potential output, level output consistent inflation time, directly observable must estimated. one simple method assume potential output time grow trend labour force expand productivity rises. development output gap provide basis assess cyclical development thus also shed light domestic price cost pressure economy. it difficult know high capacity utilisation give time. output employment figure often revise therefore always present accurate picture current economic situation. norge bank therefore also us number indicator take temperature norwegian economy. the period strong expansion begin 1997 come end winter 2003. the norwegian economy hit pronounce downturn global economy. an economic turnaround occur norway, soft land long period high domestic cost inflation sluggish external activity. output show mark increase, inflation low. monetary policy ease from spring 1999 december 2002, interest rate norway fairly stable 5.5 per cent 7 per cent. in countries, interest rate fell 2000 2001 ict equity bubble burst. the interest rate differential norway country widen due cyclical divergence. the expansion continue long period norway, strong wage cost inflation. the 2002 wage settlement result high wage growth fifth consecutive year. a persistent downturn abroad, likelihood low wage growth norway strong krone lead reduction interest rate 5 percentage point since december 2002. the sight deposit rate 1.75 per cent since march year. monetary policy ease aim bring inflation towards target 2.5 per cent stabilise development output employment. the decline interest rate since december 2002 contribute weaken krone. measure index 44 trade partner (i-44), krone depreciate 2003 almost 11 per cent strong level january year. in 2004, krone fluctuate moderately around current level. high oil price low interest rate abroad curb effect krone fall norwegian interest rates. the krone stabilise - though high level point view inflation outlook. unexpected disturbance the norwegian economy expose substantial, unexpected disturbance autumn 2002 2003. global economic development important factor behind appreciation krone. in 2003, growth global economy move different path substantially weak norge bank observer expected. weak development global economy result low interest rate abroad wide interest rate differential norway countries. development international equity market risk high oil price also contribute strengthen krone. activity world economy pick autumn 2003 low level. after expand sharply several quarters, u economy show slow growth second quarter year. economic growth pick low level euro area. economic growth also gain momentum sweden uk. strong growth u china exert upward pressure commodity price 2003 begin 2004. oil price rise considerably summer. several central bank raise interest rates. interest rate increase expect number countries. inflation low consumer price inflation norway decline sharply 2003. a number factor appear contribute decline. the appreciation krone 2002 push import price inflation. at time, change trade pattern external economic condition result unexpectedly sharp fall import prices, even measure term norwegian bi review 53/2004 3 importer pay foreign currency. the change trade pattern make considerable contribution sharp decline price clothing, footwear audiovisual equipment. rapid technological advance also push price audiovisual equipment. in norway, competition probably increase retail trade service sector recent years. in first round, heighten competition affect companies’ profit margins. but enterprise respond reduce costs. this occur part enterprise itself, subcontractor also require reduce price enhance efficiency. increase competition therefore usually trigger high productivity growth economy. low inflation may thus match high productivity. low inflation nordic country norway country inflation low. in sweden, underlie inflation fell sharply. exclude energy prices, core inflation stand 0.8 per cent sweden. inflation also slow finland denmark. one explanation this, common countries, appear intensify competition, lead high productivity growth. real exchange rate competitiveness high wage growth several year 1998 erode competitiveness norwegian business sector. the nominal krone exchange rate, measure trade-weighted index, revert around level prevail mid-1990s, labour cost manufacture rise considerably among trade partner period. however, business sector still feel effect loss competitiveness result high wage increases. the expose sector scale back. company still operation may good position cope high wage level. a effective service sector may also strengthen export industry. nevertheless, cost may limit activity employment. the international division labour shifting, face major change disadvantage norwegian business industry cost high. credit growth total credit expand broadly line growth nominal gdp. however, composition credit growth give mix signal term interest-rate set past year. household debt accumulation high, low enterprise sector. household debt increase sharply since 1994. the rise value dwell one main factor behind growth household debt. house price rise average around 9 per cent past 10 years. high persistent house price inflation may contribute hold credit growth even price level off. since portion house stock sell year, long period dwell sell high price last sold. this contribute sustain credit growth high level. this probably reflect structural adjustment deregulation house credit market 1980s, many household suffer financial distress wake relaxation. homeowner dwell rise value great scope take new mortgage-secured loans, use mortgage-equity withdrawal finance consumption investments. a persistently high rate increase house price isolation engender expectation rise thus prove self-reinforcing period push credit demand. at time, switch flexible inflation target regime reduce possibility expose household double shock form high unemployment high interest rates, case prior bank crisis begin 1990s. if economy expose disturbance may lead high unemployment, inflation normally decline interest rate lowered. high debt growth increase vulnerability household economic disturbances. a result low interest rates, household interest burden remain fairly low spite high debt growth. it may prove particularly challenge borrower ass debt-servicing 4 bi review 53/2004 capacity time period interest rate abnormally low. such low interest rate also place particular demand bank assess creditworthiness borrowers. the interest rate use reduce credit demand. at present - low interest rate abroad close link domestic interest rate krone - tight monetary policy would restrain credit demand primarily job security would reduce result strong krone. summary situation norwegian economy a turnaround norwegian economy occurred. the economy experience soft land long period high cost inflation norway sluggish external activity. • output return trend show mark rise. • employment return trend rising. • unemployment 1996-level, average 1990s. • wage growth broadly line level consistent inflation target give nomal productivity growth. • overall credit growth balanced. credit expand broadly line trend growth nominal gdp. • labour cost norway relative trade partner broadly line long-term average. • the nominal krone exchange rate line average 1990s. • the interest rate level near level prevail among trade partners. • inflation expectation approximately consistent target. in respect, equilibrium norwegian economy. but current inflation rate low, external domestic interest rate low. lag effect strong krone 2002 exert downward pressure inflation. at time, change trade pattern external economic condition push import prices, even measure term norwegian importer pay foreign currency. in norway, intensify competition appear result high productivity growth, probably contribute low inflation. the outlook norwegian economy last year, norge bank report inflation decline low level, project gradual increase. we highlight uncertainty surround inflation projection indicate inflation might remain low. subsequently, inflation fell even low level. structural adjustment good service market may imply low inflation also period ahead. growth high norwegian economy. growth mainland economy primarily reflect high activity retail trade, construction industry service sector. import expand brisk pace. there prospect continue strong growth petroleum investment 2005. employment rising, albeit still moderate pace. monetary policy influence economy long variable lags. there always uncertainty surround inflation developments. a high oil price may also impact krone exchange rate. historical deviation project actual development cpi-ate provide illustration uncertainty surround inflation projections. the fall value krone 2003, low interest rate solid growth real economy gradually push inflation. price development recent month have, nevertheless, increase risk inflation remain low long period.

institutions, canada; chairman basel accord implementation group; vice chairman basel committee bank supervision, xiii international conference bank supervisors, madrid, 20-24 september 2004. * * * introduction thank lady gentlemen. basel ii implementation one important challenge next year - bank bank supervisors. adoption new framework country domestic rule matter national processes. but, regardless approach country take adoption, implement basel ii well huge benefits, banks, bank supervisor financial stability. a year ago, question i ask frequently were, “when accord finished? will finish time?” now question i get are, “how implementation going? what go implementation challenges? what next steps?” in talk step i remind various sayings. “the long journey begin single step.” “don’t afraid big step, can´t cross chasm two steps.” “it take small step look back see far come.” i think relevant basel ii journey. i believe basel ii implement well. what i want talk morning is: • what i believe take high quality implementation occur. • cross border issues. there understandable worry home host jurisdiction work practise. there also understandable worry bank community thing. and i believe basel ii provide unique opportunity u enhance cross border communication cooperation way beneficial u financial stability. • the work accord implementation group go forward. background recently, financial stability institute (fsi) release paper speak preliminary view implementation new capital adequacy framework non-basel committee member countries. the result survey interesting. 88 non-bcbs jurisdictions, include africa, asia, caribbean, latin america, middle east non-bcbs europe intend adopt basel ii - represent 87% bank asset jurisdictions. furthermore, paper indicate many country preliminary plan implement new framework 2009. include basel member country - put total country intend adopt new accord 100. i think safe say implementation new accord forefront mind majority supervisor bank around world. even country immediate plan implement basel ii often highly interest current think experience others. they want garner useful insight help decision want consider. experience implement basel ii useful country want make improvement regulation supervision advance consider approach basel ii. we also must recognise one strength basel ii flexibility. a supervisor must ask benefit new framework bring context domestic bank system. each jurisdiction must determine possible impact new framework bank industry supervisory resources. each country must determine conditions, scope time implementation. basel ii contain menu option allow difference approach relationship nature bank nature market operate. jaime caruana comment open address, deserve emphasising. bi review 52/2004 1 shortly four panel sessions. the paper prepare focus important issue implementation. for paper question kick start discussion. i believe unique opportunity share view experience date. there jurisdiction bank answers. it discussion, share experience view concern proceed. we report back leader sessions. there ample time questions. in case undoubtedly key question area discussion bear repeat discuss plenary session follows. i encourage ask questions, raise concern make comments. so take basel ii implement well? within banks, highly important basel ii treat compliance exercise. it become part management governance bank great focus risk relate capital bank holding. we also remember basel ii judgement. judgement make bank judgement make supervisors. despite additional room analytics inherent basel ii framework, remember bank arithmetic high mathematics. neither bank supervision. it essential bank adopt discipline approach implementation strong project management skill high quality effort identify gap would like basel ii, together realistic plan move eliminate gaps. many supervisor use approach ass are, relative want be. next, communication necessary supervisors, supervisor banks, within banks, within supervisory community. one thing go supervisor represent bcbs movement basel ii responsibility policy development type front line supervision staff. more supervisor get involved. that occur basel countries, increasingly active involvement non g-10 country participate core principle liason group (cplg) directly number basel work groups, session run regional groups, fsi on. communication particularly important cross border challenge - something i return minutes. a practical attitude essential effective implementation basel ii, within bank supervisors. i want emphasize need attitude ongoing improvement learning. that’s one way implement basel ii basel ii call improvement risk management practice focus supervisors. feedback key bank supervisor supervisor banks. lastly, realism achieve need trust respect judgement others. i concern sometimes degree realism i see within industry achieved. some talk close uniform treatment across jurisdictions. that realistic. again, i see circumstance recently industry group certain individual bank call resolution home/host issue suggest bank ought deal almost exclusively home jurisdiction. that’s realistic. at time, within organizations, local management important local market virtually knowledge implementation approach adopt bank. imagine situation host supervisor communicate bank’s local management unable get even rudimentary sense bank’s approach basel ii implementation likely be. it would natural human nature supervisor start approach bank’s head office try understand bank’s plan were. multiple detail request nature would clearly implementation problem would lead cost effective implementation. but, bank neglect deal host jurisdiction adequately, part problem. what i say today i also say bank organization key role effective implementation. 2 bi review 52/2004 let say i also believe cost effective implementation interest bank supervisors. supervisor don’t unlimited resources, neither banks. and so, many way need try find way economize use resource order effective job. the workshop workshop a chair enrique marshal, superintendent bank financial institution chile. it cover plan transition basel ii. it highlight essential need country take account situation decide approach basel ii. we emphasise country determine conditions, scope time implementation. assessment national priority essential decide way forward. but material prepare workshop also emphasis basel ii, implement way respect national condition important opportunity enhance national practise regulation supervision enhance risk management practise banks. some question discussion touch factor consider develop implementation plan, challenge take account local market condition impact supervisory resources. workshop b, chair jerry hawke comptroller currency u.s. focus implementation advance approaches. there unique challenge bank supervisor get ready advance approaches. while standard advance approach credit risk reasonably well develop le current industry standard case ama operational risk. area discussion include approach assess readiness banks, validation issue home host issue particularly case ama. workshop c, daniel nouy, head commission bancaire france chairing, cover process implement pillar 2. that key part framework promote good risk assessment bank focus analysis risk assessment supervisors. pillar 2 also key expectation internationally active bank ought operate capital level pillar 1 minimum (without require series automatic capital add-ons). pillar 2 deliberately phrase general way recognise supervisory practise approach differ across countries. a well, pillar 2 requirement new accord undoubtedly meet differently large sophisticate bank small le complex entities. cross border aspect pillar 2 important. these topic question discussion. lastly workshop d, ryozo himino secretary general bcbs chairing, cover topic home/host relationships. while home host relationship nothing new, take particular importance implement basel ii. enhance communication cooperation require effective implementation particularly case complex major bank group material cross border operations. this workshop review committee’s high level principle cross border implementation, work develop real case study practical implementation plans. cross border issue i want say word cross border issues. i know lot mind room. a paper lesson learn date aig work cross border case study make available. it draft work progress. these real case study precursors, transition easily, kind practical enhance arrangement supervisory plan home host jurisdiction crucial effective implementation accord. we 17 start broaden scope deepen number. they cover credit risk operational risk. many involve non-g10 country asia, europe latin america. some non g-10 country start addition. and drive need enhance cooperation coordination? we realize it’s basel ii. it flow fact bank manage changing. but case bank risk management operation increasingly manage centrally. bank operate variety different modes. for portfolio increase degree analytics judgement make centrally. for portfolio local information local input model analytics hugely important. and recall country don’t fall neat category home’s hosts. member basel committee home country hosts. so many non g-10 countries. and explicitly recognise significance bank host country determine big bi review 52/2004 3 host country bank relative total bank. what matter also important bank host country share host country market. implement basel ii well mean home country control host country blindly accept case capital calculation do elsewhere (no matter much bank would like approach). nor implement basel ii well mean free-for-all host country act totally independently jurisdiction regardless bank organise regardless work do home supervisor. neither extreme work view. because different way bank organise it’s case host country need think good rely home jurisdictions. in many cases, home country need able get information host country relevance banks’ model analytics associate host country’s market. the aig start case study i believe enhance trust communication build solely talk it, doing. my job, job aig, push kind effort happen, draw share lesson learned. the aig recently prepare paper framework conduct real case studies. the paper i refer provide idea organise real case study enhance cooperative arrangements. it emphasis one way go this. and speak need communication practical attitude. let give example early lesson learned. these case study build concept relatively small group supervisors, home significant hosts, first start try work react bank’s plans, good coordinate efforts. well, moment supervisor involve bank hear this, want know go on, would part this? and case hadn’t tell - simple lesson communication. similarly learn quite early case bank’s plan well develop enough supervisor determine best coordinate actions. my conclusion progress date draw two essential points. first, host jurisdiction need think date information would need order able rely calculations, analytics forth develop outside jurisdiction. second, home jurisdiction need think effective way communicate work do result work assess use centrally drive risk management technique host basis rely. let also emphasise case enhance home/host relationship follow specific formula. i aware kind form cooperation range simple share information joint participation examinations. and case enhance communication co-operations lead change jurisdiction mandate home host supervisors. work aig let close talk moment work aig. one main priority cross border issues. we instrumental committee’s release high level principle relate cross border issue generally operational risk. we want share experience course correct necessary principle play practise. we continue share experience real case study development actual implementation plans. the aig rule set body - expect produce rule extensive guidance. we create group go validation issue advance approach piece piece, take account industry view produce kind cookbook approach validation use supervisors. we also recently create together capital task force, main body produce accord itself, joint group consider issue downturn lgds relate issue stress test pillar 2 accord. i anticipate group produce guidance implementation accord also interact extensively industry current practice practice might evolve. 4 bi review 52/2004 the aig delve op risk area, focus ama approach implementation challenge there. we involve involve non-g10 country validation ama work. the aig already complete early year, survey preliminary intention national discretion item amongst basel committee countries. a number non-g10 country also choose indicate intention result, provide information g-10 country intention stage. the committee agree principle publish information update share among supervisor late year. i think help supervisor know intention others make decision information country choice also helpful consider cross border implementation. we spend fair amount time pillar 2 aig likely get back course year early next year. that result clarification issue committee. our focus immediate future specific element pillar 2, ass concentration risk. the aig meet regularly cplg work group capital. the discussion productive frank times. we clear misunderstand real dialogue challenge approach meet challenges. conclusion a approach issue implement basel ii - when, - i think important keep mind challenge also benefits. good relate capital risk, promote enhance risk measurement management practise internationally active banks, enhance supervisory focus, present huge opportunities. opportunity u supervisors, constituency serve banks, market economies. while challenge implementation won’t prefect, goodwill, good feedback ongoing communication, basel ii implement well. i look forward result. thank you. bi review 52/2004 5 john hurley: financial stability report 2004 open statement mr john hurley, governor central bank financial service authority ireland, presentation financial stability report 2004, dublin, 21 september 2004. * * * general introduction i would like welcome publication central bank’s first annual stand-alone report stability financial system ireland. the report publish accordance mandate central bank financial service authority ireland act, 2003. our mandate member european system central bank also require us, conjunction various national central banks, contribute financial stability. financial stability report element discharge mandate. this fourth report publish financial stability issue analysis publish chapter annual report. the publication stand-alone report allow u expand greatly depth analysis financial stability issues. for first time, seven research article complement analysis special attention pay irish house market result recent exercise stress-testing bank system undertake jointly financial service regulator. what financial stability? financial stability exist various component financial system (financial markets, payment settlement system financial intermediation) function smoothly without interruption, component resilient shock. if financial institution run difficulty banks, business consumer could negatively affected. there many example financial crisis past various country prove costly term economic disruption lose growth. the primary aim financial stability analysis try identify factor might lead crisis future. this major task crisis tend different previous one. background report the publication report contribution towards promotion financial stability. it intend increase awareness among player financial system various important issue stake ensure continue health system. there two distinct approach adopt publication; first, report current health irish financial system second, highlight possible shock could hit system simulate, extent possible, likely impact shocks. the nature exercise involve financial stability analysis quite distinct type require economic report publish central bank, quarterly bulletins. we forecast shock occur, limit analysis shock likely occur, look broad range possible shock form view robustness system withstand shocks. key issue highlight report in short address i confine remark mostly four areas, namely property prices, credit growth, stress-testing dimension global risks. frank browne provide comment presentation follow. bi review 52/2004 1 property price from examination financial stability issues, risk unanticipated sudden fall residential property prices, accompany increase default rate among mortgage holders, risk pose great threat health bank system. however, shock absorption capacity bank system currently adequate. regard question whether house price overvalued, analysis report give quite mix results. some measure suggest significant overvaluation others provide evidence overvaluation. however, certain house price continue increase double digit figures, risk sharp correction would pronounced. in context, present tentative indication gradual slowdown house price inflation welcomed. this development consistent large increase supply decline rental income evident time. of course, note that, even significant overvaluation house prices, sizeable deterioration fundamental determinant market could still mean house price could fall significantly also would adverse implication financial stability. credit growth household sector a i say july, credit growth continue concern - especially credit property-related purposes. the continuation current rate credit growth household sector, well excess correspond rate countries, inevitably lead highly indebted household sector country. this underline need lender borrower stress-test every borrower’s ability repay debts, economically favourable circumstance exist today, also challenge circumstances. in context credit growth, focus medium- long-term increase indebtedness increase vulnerability borrower income employment shock future years. in discuss vulnerability, important bear mind current low level interest rates. there danger may cause participant house market associate adoption euro permanently low interest rates. since new mortgage period excess twenty years, borrower must take long-term view interest rates. variable mortgage interest rate (which represent bulk outstanding mortgages) reflect euro area economy short-term, unlikely reflect economy medium long term. we continue work closely colleague regulatory authority, develop joint work stress testing, following-up result mortgage lend study undertake last year. specifically, authority request tighten relation client income verification fund mortgage loan balance order ensure loan properly secure repay full. they monitor lend practice ongoing basis. in addition, authority is, part review conduct business rules, consult industry consumer benefit measure require lend institution obtain borrower, writing, agreement assessment borrowers’ ability repay. stress-testing credit institution a stress test bank system complete last 12 months. this involve bank simulate impact financial position hit severe recession. the outcome exercise positive. the financial position bank system, twelve credit institution include test, prove resilient simulate recession. however, result qualify stress-testing technique use still develop may subject number shortcomings. international dimension in analysis irish financial stability, assessment international development critical factor. the extreme openness irish economy make exceptionally vulnerable shock emanate abroad. systemically threaten shock likely originate abroad within irish economy. the interaction shock vulnerability might present 2 bi review 52/2004 domestic financial system could result systemic weakness. unemployment well interest rates, crucial factor analysis financial health irish economy, rise result development outside economy. currently, several international development implication stability irish economy financial system. the important concern large global imbalances, commodity price pressure expectation monetary tighten globally. conclusion let conclude short address state hope achieve publish annual financial stability report. first, hope identify potential risk irish financial system second endeavour raise level awareness risk economic agents, include household businesses. finally, propose continue ongoing dialogue bank context find report objective arrive common understand development might suggest risk financial stability. bi review 52/2004 3 jean-claude trichet: the transformation international financial architecture meet challenge globalisation arthur burn memorial lecture mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, organise atlantik-brücke e.v., frankfurt, 20 september 2004. * * * it great pleasure i accept invitation atlantik-brücke give year’s arthur burn memorial lecture. this lecture series dedicate outstanding central banker also history eminent speaker past years. therefore, i would like thank atlantik-brücke invite me, i also greatly appreciate hospitality bundesbank. tonight, i would like offer think transform international financial architecture meet challenge globalisation. i focus development last three decades, period international community confront tremendous continual challenge arise important structural change global economic financial system. during period international community also learn key lesson launch profound adjustment term international financial architecture, i.e. policy framework global financial system. let first explain i mean structural change global economic financial system. the steady opening-up good capital market lead grow integration different country around globe, still witness process today opening-up india china. on average, trade grow much rapidly gdp past decades. especially mid-1980s onwards 1990s, world trade expand substantially world output growth every year, difference reach much 7 percentage point years. these different growth rate imply last two decades, real gdp double whereas volume world trade tripled. moreover, trade increasingly expanded, include full spectrum tradable good primary commodity finish products, mean many production processes, automobile computers, today span several economies, also several continents. financial integration also increase due capital market liberalisation, rapid technological change financial innovation, see strength good time bad. this economic financial globalisation enormous benefits, also pose challenge entail risks. one major benefit globalisation emerge also develop country increasingly involve exchange good capital benefit transfer know-how technologies. especially emerge market have, time, become major global trade partner well recipient financial flows. some them, especially asia, turn nearly industrialise country decade growth rate high-income countries, become source international capital flows. over last four years, roughly 20 emerge country latin america, eastern europe asia account 30% world export receive 20% gross global foreign direct investment (fdi), figure close fdi inflow unite states. great integration also mean great economic financial spillover effect one country one region rest world. some effect positive, others le so. the main positive spillover, i see it, global economy benefit strong growth many emerge market economies, especially asia. china become one main growth engines, region, worldwide, contribute one-third world gdp growth average 2000-2003 (in ppp-terms). moreover, capital mobility financial integration allow save invest national global scale, thereby increase economic efficiency promote growth. what challenges? globalisation capital mobility also make international system vulnerable change investor sentiment. on several occasion witness contagion effect spread one country one market others. some crisis originate public sector, debt crisis 1980s, start poland mexico spread latin america, africa, middle east soviet union, mexican crisis 1994, asian crisis 1997/1998, russian crisis 1998, recent crisis brazil, argentina turkey. others, contrast, stem mainly event private sector, stock bi review 52/2004 1 market collapse 1987, bond market crash 1994, near-failure large hedge fund long-term capital management (ltcm) 1998, stock exchange fall burst technology bubble 2000. despite difference origin, nature magnitude, event one thing common: represent major threat stability international financial system. the international community always manage resolve crises, cost incur respective economy significant. in many instances, level output fell dramatically, sometimes even double figures. for example, argentina turkey real gdp fell much 10-11% bad year crises. these event highlight potential vulnerability globalise system and, way, underscore need systemic change policy framework international economic financial system. policy-makers rethink best promote stability achieve growth ever-changing environment characterise globalisation. an impressive reform agenda gradually launch cope new challenges. many reform focus prevent financial crisis happen - still occur - manage resolve them. this ongoing work influence considerably widespread recognition two fundamental principles. first, general consensus give private sector market central role, focus sound public policy institution provide market participant appropriate environment. give increasingly liberalise financial systems, private sector bind play key role provide capital also, probably importantly, discipline overall economic policy. second, increase international cooperation consider key give mismatch globalise market national policy responsibilities. indeed, scope international cooperation widened, also form cooperation evolve time. let expand key area important lesson learn significant adjustment international financial architecture initiate implemented. i first talk main change international monetary system comment institutional set-up international system, touch upon reform effort area crisis prevention resolution. 1. international monetary system look international monetary system, say since collapse bretton wood system fix exchange rate early 1970s, basically system place. the current situation manifold monetary arrangement sometimes characterise “non-system”. in view, true. it correct live increasingly complex world multitude exchange rate regime - one-third imf country currency peg one major currency currency basket, others various modality float exchange rate system pure float le manage float. the role market determine exchange rate become important. and learn - painfully - course several crisis economic fundamental policy country play decisive role development stability exchange rates. but important role attribute market mean long role exchange rate policy. let highlight two aspects. for one thing, country-specific characteristic use determine suitable regime country. while hold true every country, especially important emerge market economies. economy differ widely evolve time. the exchange rate regime need compatible economic fundamental wide policy framework, include regional integration effort well trade financial links. from perspective, regime subject change fundamental evolve circumstance dictate. it long since consensus emerge single exchange rate system insulate country financial crises. a year ago, widely hold view move towards corner solutions, form either hard peg free floats, would help prevent crises. however, recent experience show currency regime fully crisis-proof. currency float suffice eliminate difficulty crises. at end spectrum, currency board argentina delayed, prevent, fully-blown crisis. 2 bi review 52/2004 another aspect that, lead currency indeed floating, exchange rate development certainly ignored. the preference major country economic area exchange rate flexibility natural consequence trade openness, dependence capital movement necessity pursue independent monetary policy, gear towards domestic objectives. however, international level, exist mechanism policy cooperation, include exchange rates. in particular, last 20 year g7/g3 prove effective forum finance minister central bank governor exchange view broad range policy issue agree, appropriate, specific policy messages, include foreign exchange market case exceptional situations. only take recent example message i think agree g7 communiqués boca raton spring meet year useful. 2. the institutional set-up the second area major change i would like highlight institutional set-up international system. since establishment 1944, bretton wood institutions, imf world bank, maintain central role system. but - still - subject profound change. this year’s sixtieth anniversary bretton wood institution occasion many observer review development two institution background change environment. the dramatic change imf breakdown bretton wood system early 1970s, mean lose previous role guardian fix adjustable exchange rate system fundamentally adapt mandate. moreover, international debt crisis 1980s also transform impact fund, first time imf act international crisis manager - role still perform today. it interest note imf refuse time approve standby arrangement crisis-hit country receive assurance bank creditor would share burden provide fresh money. twenty year later, involvement private sector still agenda good crisis management. all subsequent crisis reconfirm imf’s central role crisis manager, try coordinate reform policy country concern temporary official finance effort restore confidence financial commitment part private creditors. new challenge materialise imf world bank collapse communism, result 20 new member need specific policy advice transition centrally plan economies. since asian crisis 1990s, imf world bank undergo considerable changes. they push become transparent, sharpen respective focus, reinforce policy advice financial support. discussion also still ongoing appropriate representation develop emerge market two institutions. in addition change imf world bank, two issue address significant consequence institutional set-up, namely representation emerge market economy cooperation financial sector issues: first, grow importance emerge markets, way find integrate good international policy dialogue. the creation g20 1999 constitute view decisive highly welcome step reflect adequately newly globalise economy. the g20 turn international forum dialogue consensus-building economy systemic influence, whether industrialise emerging. i convince discussion g20 facilitate consensus important element international reform agenda. second, equally important financial stability forum, establish order improve international cooperation financial sector issues. the fsf uniquely position review global financial system system, informal forum address issue cross-sectoral perspective, presence global association banking, insurance security supervisors, pertinent international institutions, imf world bank, bis, treasury central bank deal major financial market places. since 2001, fsf also hold regional meet non-member financial authority latin america, asia-pacific region central eastern europe broaden dialogue financial stability issues. bi review 52/2004 3 conceptually, i think financial stability forum represent major advance first time international community stress issues, challenge risk must examine comprehensive complete fashion, systemic implications, whether analyse standpoint international financial institutions, supervision authorities, financial stability perspective central banks. it also explicitly point optimise function particular subcomponents global financial system, proper spheres, suffice. a cross-check level overall system remain essence. the best bank supervision concept work isolate manner could counterproductive feature global stability perspective. it would best account concept creative imaginative function security markets. this sense necessity global systemic “optimisation” top “sub-optimisation” particular subcomponent significant contribution financial stability forum, even lot remain do effective implementation. 3. crisis prevention have talk change institutional set-up, i would like discus crisis prevention, key area reform efforts. give crisis costly country concern international system, emphasis must place learn lesson past implement lesson rigorously. i please note considerable progress already achieve make country whole system resilient shocks. in context, i would like highlight transparency promotion best practices, two key element crisis prevention. transparency precondition well-functioning markets, since facilitate good risk management lead strengthen market discipline. it therefore welcome significant change introduce number fields. for example, long ago imf start disclose information policy encourage increase transparency member countries. it also reassure large number international standard code good practice agree upon, cover different field transparency fiscal policy monetary financial polices, bank supervision, corporate governance, account auditing. transparency private sector also crucial, recent corporate scandal highlight crucial role account standard play respect. i consider progress make field transparency asian crisis one main reason absence contagion latin america emerge world follow argentine crisis. i believe enhance transparency help investor differentiate good country countries’ effort adhere international standard code well reflect markets’ assessment countries. transparency standard code element implement improve domestic policy-making, especially emerge market economies, make resilient shocks. the debate sustainable exchange rate regimes, prudent sustainable debt management well-sequenced capital account liberalisation example area important lesson learnt. in addition, response grow importance financial markets, increase focus policy advice give imf world bank financial sector policy vulnerability domestic financial systems. to sum up, i believe considerable progress make help reduce frequency severity crises. however, still learn lesson past, work need important areas. 4. crisis management despite effort put prevention side, would optimistic assume crises. however, experience show timely, efficient smooth management financial problem underlie cause country help minimise losses. therefore, i address issue relate management financial crises. every single crisis different. every case call appropriate balance domestic adjustment, private sector involvement official support. therefore, crisis management practice struggle inherent tension rule clarity one hand discretion 4 bi review 52/2004 flexibility other. however, learn official sector need predictable clearer. only consistent behaviour imf international community provide right incentive country private sector investors. some large financial package grant imf past might lead misperception imf would always bail private creditors. this, turn, might bring element moral hazard, namely over-borrowing part country lenient risk management part private investors. moral hazard concern limit availability official fund therefore lead increase call appropriate involvement private sector crisis management. in order make official finance predictable, specific criterion procedure set last year exceptional access imf resources. we europe much favour set clear rule clear limit imf finance view substantial finance package provide country 1990s early year decade. it important rule implement clearly, least order send right signal markets. with regard appropriate involvement private sector crisis management, different proposal launch past ten years. in wake mexican crisis 1994/95, g10 recommend increase use so-called collective action clause sovereign bonds. it argue clause would help overcome coordination problem sovereign debtor numerous bondholder since enable qualify majority creditor agree term restructuring, also bind dissent creditors. but time need convince issuer market participant usefulness clauses. and also need mexico overcome first-mover problem february last year. since last year, remarkable convergence market practice take place. in first six month year, practically bond issue new york law include collective action clauses, worldwide 83% foreign currency sovereign bond include clauses. despite widespread fears, experience far reveal discernible impact borrow cost country concerned. give limit use past, little experience far gain use collective action clause actual resolution sovereign debt crises. ukraine, moldova uruguay use clause context bond exchange order bind minority creditor would otherwise object bond exchange. besides progress collective action clauses, i please note work proceed development code good conduct. i suggest time ago guideline behaviour debtor country creditor regard information sharing, dialogue close cooperation time financial distress. such guideline embed code agree country creditor might help prevent liquidity problem turn deep financial crisis serious repercussion party involved. they would also improve handle debt restructurings, become unavoidable. discussion currently take place emerge market issuer private sector representative main element code. i would like encourage party active constructive possible. it clear initiative lead improvement crisis prevention resolution main stakeholders, i.e. emerge market issuer private sector representatives, fully “buy into” process. the official sector would play catalyse role context. to sum up, important lesson learn significant change introduce also area crisis management. that said, implementation agree principle still remain challenge. close remark lady gentlemen, live begin twenty-first century world profoundly transform last fifty sixty year since bretton wood institution set up. in way, see today large part make dream second half forty fifty twentieth century become reality: • the fall iron curtain, european unity mark end dramatic political conceptual divide emblematic illustration world unite global level far values, principle economic rule concerned; bi review 52/2004 5 • the rapid development emerge country country transition permit catch towards good standard live large proportion poor citizen world locate china, india, emerge asia, latin america; • the acceleration scientific technological advances, include - exclusively - domain it - give full body global economy major impulse; under profound philosophical, conceptual, economic transformation progressively invent new fully globalise economic financial system, human resources, goods, services, capital, concepts, idea move around planet instantaneously fairly rapidly. this created, turn, wealth new chance new opportunity are, always, associate new challenge new risks. one particular responsibility sphere central bank guard financial instability, promote financial stability. if i sum cope present circumstances, i would say three main challenges: understand, tirelessly upgrade institution remain alert. • to understand, first. research necessary ever deeper, profound operational understand new global financial system. it precedent complexity defy previous modelling. we already do lot direction: understand credibility important, particularly credibility authority like central banks; understand good phenomenon contagion, herd behaviour globalise environment; understand good structural flexibility improve resilience. but lot remain done, particular understand dynamic system potential instability. • second, upgrade tirelessly institutions, informal groupings, rule regulations, code good practice conduct. a global system must monitor global level party concern systemic influence. the aim prevent instability must present respective entity concerned. a lot do domain sometimes underestimated. a lot remain done. • and, third, stand ready weather economic financial shock open crisis come. there time complacency. we minimise risks. but economic theory empirical observation suggest chance opportunity dimension magnitude global economy present display suppose risk take cannot eliminate totally. this call important progress two areas: augment resilience call structural reform particularly necessary europe; preserve capacity give fairly rapid response global level thank intimate confident cooperation, particular across atlantic two major industrialise economies. it remark atlantik-brücke important ever i conclude exposition. thank attention. 6 bi review 52/2004 irma rosenberg: monetary policy, house price household indebtedness speech m irma rosenberg, deputy governor sverige riksbank, sparbanken finn’s customer meeting, lund, 20 september 2004. * * * introduction let begin thank invitation come speak sparbanken finn’s customer meeting. tonight i intend talk something much debate medium recently; namely increase house price household indebtedness significance monetary policy. house price trends, combine increase indebtedness, could instance cause significant problem future household take account calculation fact interest rate rise present low levels. be something take account make monetary policy decisions? to answer question, i shall begin word conduct monetary policy aim policy. i shall go describe development household borrow house price important drive force behind them. i shall also mention household wealth include forecast whether reason pay particular attention development debt house price monetary policy stance. in conclusion, i shall also briefly comment present economic situation inflation outlook. the aim monetary policy the riksbank assign two task riksdag (the swedish parliament). the first entail maintain price stability second involve promote safe efficient payment system, i.e. contribute financial stability. in addition, possible without create conflict aims, shall also take account aim economic policy, economic growth employment. maintain price stability mean concrete term riksbank set inflation target monetary policy. the rate price increase term consumer price index, cpi, shall limit 2 per cent year tolerate deviation interval +/- 1 percentage point. the fact deviation target tolerated, within set interval, monetary policy sufficiently precise able bring inflation exactly 2 per cent time. however, deviation must large, long duration. the riksbank mainly endeavour influence inflation raise low key rate - repo rate. the aim subdue stimulate demand order affect balance supply demand economy, thereby resource utilisation inflationary pressure. an adjustment interest rate affect cost borrow thereby also demand house households’ demand primarily durable goods. the speed strength impact interest rate adjustment extent depend household indebtedness asset holdings, instance, housing. a monetary policy impact certain time lag, difficult steer inflation short term. monetary policy decision therefore base inflation forecast, usually look one two year ahead. this approximate time require effect adjustment interest rate pas various channel economy attain full impact rate price increase. at time, try conduct monetary policy way avoid excessive fluctuation production employment. this may give u reason extend forecast perspective little beyond two-year horizon. one could say riksbank conduct flexible inflation-targeting policy, concept i return later. development household indebtedness house price before i go detail significance debt wealth monetary policy, i would first like comment development indebtedness house price sweden compare development countries. bi review 51/2004 1 in recent years, household borrow property price increase rapidly sweden, many countries. debt increase disposable incomes, sweden debt ratio, i.e. debt relation disposable incomes, approach level see crisis period early 1990s. house prices, regard across country whole, rise since end 1996. the rate increase vary year 7 10 percentage point year accord statistic sweden’s real estate price index. a i see it, several factor partly structural nature behind development. one decline interest rates, largely result economic policy conducted. the fact credit market deregulate recent decade become efficient also create beneficial condition household borrowing. these drive force similar many countries, although occur slightly different point time. the fact household increase indebtedness extent also due changeover economic policy take place sweden begin 1990s, focus price stability. public finance consolidate inflation target introduced. confidence low-inflation policy establish gradually bring great stability economy, low inflation interest rates. a stable economy make easy predict future development interest rate inflation. this turn mean risk connect slightly high indebtedness perceive smaller. in recent years, household loan largely use buy housing. the fact increase lend household go hand hand rise property price therefore surprise. the rapid increase house price second half 1990s partly due decline interest rates. however, also explanatory factors. naturally, income growth also play important role. other drive force behind house price trend include demography relocation flow contribute large demand house certain area country, particularly metropolitan regions. there also factor impact, reduce house subsidy rise construction costs. there also relatively little new build since crisis years, despite substantial demand housing. nevertheless, appear trend regard construction turned. the increase house price turn contribute rise value household wealth, well collateral loans. household debt percentage total assets, among thing include housing, equity save insurance policies, therefore show relatively little increase, despite fact loan rise relation disposable incomes. the fall interest rate also mean percentage households’ disposable income use pay interest expenditure tax currently low, despite increase indebtedness. be reason concern household acquire large debt house price rise much could cause problem future? to determine this, necessary perception long-term sustainable levels. one point worth note begin with, swedish nation whole increase indebtedness recent years. on contrary, large surplus current account indicate external debt declined. this contribute make economy whole le vulnerable rise interest rates. in respect differ number countries, household indebtedness increase rapidly, deficit current account several years. this applies, instance, unite states, unite kingdom australia. development household indebtedness sweden remarkable see relation oecd countries. it clearly difficult compare level debt ratio different countries. difference taxation systems, credit term percentage population home-owners factor complicate analysis. on hand, comparison much debt ratio increase different country recent year provide perspective development sweden. it appear development in, instance, unite kingdom australia much dramatic sweden. property price also rise rapidly countries. however, unite states, deregulate credit market early stage countries, indebtedness increase slightly slow rate, although show decline mid-1990s, sweden. the structure credit market word loan contract also affect property prices, lead difference trend countries. one example countries, unite state denmark, opportunity renegotiate fixed-rate loan - low cost - interest rate fall. 2 bi review 51/2004 one phenomenon probably significant indebtedness property price countries, appear particularly common sweden, private household invest property rent out. this occurs, instance, unite kingdom and, probably even great extent, australia, loan make investment comprise approximately one-third banks’ lend households.1 the fact household borrow money buy property addition house rent probably increase risk speculative element price-setting. at time, make household vulnerable change interest rate income. they also become sensitive change balance rent property market. this mean risk substantial fluctuation house price probably great country common buy house rent out. there thus increase indebtedness internationally, parallel rise property prices. a case sweden, question arise regard sustainability trend happen interest rate rise. development house price household indebtedness regularly analyse riksbank's financial stability reports. of course, assessment valuation house market connect large measure uncertainty. however, calculation make far indicate price house sweden whole significantly balance. price trend explain fairly well increase household incomes, decline interest rate low construction rate, despite strong demand. however, one aware rate price increase vary substantially different regions. house price increase much fast rate metropolitan area rest country. the possibility price increase may exaggerate certain individual region market cannot rule out, although development sweden whole appear balanced. indebtedness, house price inflation forecast what significance house price household indebtedness riksbank's inflation forecasts? the inflation forecast base analysis various drive force behind domestic inflation international rate price increase, import inflation. domestic inflation largely govern cost trend total demand develop relation production capacity, say, resource utilisation. household consumption comprise significant part total demand indebtedness house price trend mainly come forecast work. household wealth play important role riksbank’s assessment private consumption develop. wealth affect households’ consumption several ways. to simplify, one say two reason increase wealth, instance form increase value one’s home, expect lead increase consumption. firstly, large wealth individual has, consume lifetime. this traditional wealth effect. secondly, size wealth affect possibility obtain loans. this usually call balance sheet effect. the large collateral household offer loans, great possibility borrow thereby consume. when value property own household increases, also provide possibility take loan property, instance, extend renovate increase value property, consume goods. another effect high valuation provide possibility renew last mortgage loan first mortgage loan thereby reduce interest cost loans. there also empirical support positive correlation wealth consumption. wealth also significance strongly household affect interest changes. an adjustment interest rate affect price households’ assets, house thereby wealth, channel indirect effect households’ consumption way i described. however, adjustment interest rate also direct effect households’ purchase power willingness incur debt via interest cost borrowing. the speed strength impact interest rate adjustment households’ interest expenditure depend large extent, i mention earlier, size debts, percentage loan variable-rate loan average fixed-rate term loan fix interest rate. the percentage variable-rate loan increase 1990s currently around 35 per cent total debts. the large percentage variable-rate loan household has, fast 1 see pp 15-17, financial stability report 2004:1 bi review 51/2004 3 interest rate adjustment affect interest expenditure. the fact indebtedness house price increase thereby contribute rapid possibly also strong impact monetary policy household consumption demand previously. do inflation forecast contain relevant information house price indebtedness? a i mention earlier, riksbank’s monetary policy normally base forecast inflation one two year ahead. two important issue context whether sufficiently long time perspective whether problem forecast method lead effect households’ increase indebtedness underestimated. the reason riksbank choose focus inflation forecast one two year ahead perspective monetary policy assume attain full impact. however, possible disregard expectation inflation real economy develop beyond two-year horizon. sometimes shock may occur affect economy much long period two years. this indicate monetary policy should, principle, also take account whether event now, development household indebtedness house prices, expect serious repercussion real economy inflation long perspective. however, present reason believe development house market household indebtedness entail risk create shock would require special consideration monetary policy. so potential problem regard assess indebtedness property price affect inflation? our forecast base calculation use economic model qualitative assessment factor expect affect inflation. the theoretical model usually base household behave rational manner. this involve household make plan future build expectation future economic developments, also systematic error expectations. it unlikely households’ rationalism case overestimate formal models. if case, conclusion regard effect of, instance, repo rate rise calculate use model may incorrect. one example would household include calculation fact interest rate rise economic activity strengthen indebtedness house price therefore push beyond sustainable levels. something give rise special problem forecast context change indebtedness property price tendency reinforce one another economic cycle. low interest rate make cheap finance house purchases, mean house price rise. a value collateral households’ loan mainly consist house tenant-owned apartments, price increase contribute make possible borrow money. sooner later, interest rate rise question happen then. if indebtedness house price trend upturn phase base over-optimism unrealistic expectation among lender borrowers, house price may fall sharply household may experience difficulty meet interest payments. demand economy fall substantially. it difficult completely capture sequence event change different variable tend reinforce one another economic calculations. if household also overly optimistic - irrational - expectations, become particularly difficult capture effects. it therefore important forecaster make “qualitative” assessment addition. another reason trust solely formal model base historical data effect structural change take place fairly recently easily underestimated. let give example extent capture problems. during year mid-1980s begin 1990s, substantial change make economic structure clear correlation change house price change household borrowing. the decline house price financial crisis begin 1990s largely due unfavourable combination change structural cyclical nature. in connection deregulation credit market second half 1980s, household borrow increase substantially loan largely use buy houses. the fairly high fluctuate inflation rate contribute real interest cost tax often low, sometimes even negative, practice mean one could time make profit borrowing. at begin 1990s, tax system reformed, entail substantial reduction opportunity deduct interest expenditure. interest rate rise substantially time, 4 bi review 51/2004 swedish economy affect international economic slowdown. this negative effect household borrow house prices. could similar situation arise today? although see rapid increase indebtedness house price recent years, present situation quite different, low-inflation policy thereby stable economic environment. nor extensive structural change nature would completely alter condition households’ decision indebtedness property purchases. monetary policy take account factor inflation in principle, household indebtedness development house price could create problem payment system. this something regularly analyse riksbank’s financial stability reports. the conclusion draw recent report june risk household sector alone able create large loss bank threaten payment system slight. a i mention earlier, assessment house price country whole reasonable. a special study household debt include june report, show that, average, household assess good margin manage rise interest expenditure increase unemployment. it also worth mention property crisis begin 1990s, household cause problem banks. a i mention earlier, riksbank, like many central banks, conduct flexible inflation-targeting policy. in addition take account price stability, monetary policy may certain case wish take account development real economy whole. this mean, instance, conduct le aggressive interest rate policy thereby allow inflation return target gradually disturbance avoid excessive fluctuation production employment. in connection build-up household debt price trend housing, could situation household may base decision incorrect expectation trend may prove unsustainable, see tangible risk situation arising. this could lead adjustment process, house price fell heavily decline real economy whole. we explain clarification monetary policy publish 1999 that, choose take consideration account, clearly motivate decision. if flexible inflation target function well, lead small fluctuation production, without cause average inflation rise. the scope conduct policy determine households’ companies’ confidence monetary policy. if considerable confidence, little risk inflation expectation affect inflation deviate temporarily target level. at present, i cannot see real economy consideration could lead riksbank wish deviate normal rule thumb monetary policy, give current level household indebtedness. my assessment appear conflict price stability stability financial real economy. the current situation before i summarise i say tonight, i would like briefly comment current perception future inflation. our assessment spring economic activity sweden abroad would continue strengthen year come two years. inflation sweden expect relatively stable come year increase gradually resource utilisation rise sweden abroad. the conclusion inflation would line target level two year ahead, therefore choose leave repo rate unchanged. at meet august, appear reason expect slightly rapid growth sweden abroad, give reason assume high figure resource utilisation inflation. however, still anticipate inflation would line target two year ahead. the conclusion draw riksbank august regard future inflation still largely stands, opinion. however, may reason upward revision inflation forecast make may, perhaps even one make august. one factor could indicate high inflation rate, least short term, high oil prices. resource utilisation may also slightly high anticipate come years. one reason strong figure swedish growth see summer. another fiscal policy probably become expansionary bi review 51/2004 5 now. inflation nevertheless expect line riksbank's target two year now. this also picture paint speech riksbank governor lars heikensten london today. conclusion let summarise i say evening. despite stock market fluctuation periodically weak economic climate, household indebtedness house price increase substantially, national level, recent years. there similar development many countries, households’ debt interest payment percentage disposable income remarkably high sweden. although debt ratio approach high level prior financial crisis begin 1990s, low interest rate mean time households' interest expenditure percentage income largely halve since then. our calculation also indicate household debt average relatively good safety margin interest rate rise reduction income. we therefore present envisage major problem household sector whole, even interest rate rise significantly. however, mean problem arise individual household case high interest rates. it important borrower include rise interest rate expenditure calculation carefully consider level indebtedness manage interest rate sooner late begin rise. for reason, emphasise connection monetary policy decision past six month interest rate present low historical perspective need raise long run. with regard house prices, calculation make far indicate price house country whole substantially unbalanced. the development explain fairly well factor disposable income, live costs, construction cost fact relatively little new building, despite strong demand. supply expect increase slightly slow rate demand come years. my assessment present imbalance build could risk lead sharp fall price ahead. however, rapid increase house price indebtedness occur something shall monitor closely. i would time like emphasise monetary policy often involve difficult considerations. if i colleague come conclusion serious imbalance build economy way threaten stability payment system, way felt would serious consequence real economy future, may want take account conduct monetary policy. however, far, consideration concern effect house price household indebtedness element inflation play marginal role monetary policy. 6 bi review

dodge, governor bank canada, canadian chamber commerce, calgary, alberta, 20 september 2004. * * * good afternoon. i'm glad back calgary. we bank canada welcome opportunity get across country, speak business people, hear perspective economy. the feedback receive business coast coast important part monetary policy deliberations. i know staff regional office calgary work hard stay top local business condition prairies, office regions. i happy opportunity meet national body chamber commerce. i tell regular contact ottawa liaison group valuable me. the bank look chamber help u understand economic development unfold industry level. and i particularly want thank chamber ongoing partner effort smoothly introduce three new high-denomination bank note year. this second straight year set currency-education kiosk annual meeting, help spread word new bank notes. you learn security feature include high-denomination notes. and material new $20 note unveil last month, go circulation begin next wednesday, 29 september. i add i'll back calgary 13 october unveil new $50 bank note, go circulation begin mid-november. during past year, powerful force continue shape global economy. alberta, indeed canada, felt impact forces. of course, evolution global economy short-term event. some force currently work build years. similarly, today's development may repercussions, raise need adjustments, year come. so today, i want talk canada's economic outlook prospect monetary policy within context evolve world economy. how monetary policy framework work i start brief review monetary policy framework. let remind goal canadian monetary policy. experience teach u best contribution bank canada make good economic performance keep inflation low, stable, predictable. by so, provide backdrop best allow economy grow strong sustainable way. we aim keep inflation - measure annual rate increase consumer price index - 2 per cent. it's important note conduct monetary policy symmetric way. this mean raise interest rate dampen total demand see inflation threaten rise 2 per cent target next 18 24 months. in way, low interest rate stimulate demand see trend inflation poise fall target. this symmetric approach monetary policy deliver average rate inflation close 2 per cent since inflation target adopt 1991. it also important keep mind monetary policy action take time full effect. the lag variable, typically take year half two year change interest rate full impact economy inflation. that say need forward look monetary policy, always try ass state economy 18 24 month future. specifically, try evaluate various factor affect supply demand, help u estimate future size output gap. what i mean "output gap?" that term refer difference actual output - economy produce - potential output - maximum amount economy could produce without trigger high inflation. another way sometimes refer concept talk close economy production capacity. this idea important economy operate capacity - or, economist like put it, excess demand positive output gap - inflationary pressure build. but economy operate capacity - mean excess supply negative output gap - disinflationary pressure set in. ideally, bi review 51/2004 1 want see economy operate close capacity, total demand roughly balance total supply. if achieve this, best outcome time - strong, sustainable growth avoid boom busts, along rise employment low inflation. one major problem cannot directly measure potential output. further, economic data measure actual output often revise - sometimes significantly so. the challenge us, then, lie estimate size output gap, always significant degree uncertainty around estimate. so look number economic variable help u form opinion large output gap is. you find variable web site. they include, among others, indicator capacity good markets, sign tightness labour markets, signal pressure real estate market. some quantitative, qualitative, base survey business conduct regional offices. another indicator rate inflation itself. if core inflation - strip eight highly volatile component consumer price index - consistently come expectations, may lead u adjust view current size output gap. earlier, i say economy operate near capacity, total demand canadian good service - economist like refer "aggregate demand" - roughly balance total supply. total demand two component - domestic demand foreign demand. assess foreign demand difficult, represent large share total output canada, bank spend great deal time effort try gauge demand. of course, nothing new say economy importantly affect event abroad. canada always rely international trade. for long time now, unite state focus attention assess world economy. but many today's global economic development origin outside north america, notably asia. before i talk current implications, i would like take minute discus nature development likely implication next decade so. the medium-term implication global development just japan korea emerge major player global stage previous decades, china quickly become economic powerhouse. and india far behind. when consider two country account 40 per cent world's population, hard see impact global economy. a look ahead, clear china india major global competitors, labour-intensive industries, increasingly skill-intensive industry well. it's pattern development world see before. establish firm many industry feel competitive pressure china india, large pool surplus labour country absorbed. but time, process create income wealth china india and, hence, increase ability buy good service abroad. so, integration country global economy represent competitive challenge tremendous opportunity industrialize world. these emerge market - markets. china already one large importer world importance increase next decade. this source grow demand provide much-needed boost global economy general canadian economy particular. we already see canadian commodity producer step fill demand asia. indeed, statistic canada recently report value canadian export china first seven month year rise 58 per cent compare period 2003. there also opportunity canadian firm integrate low-cost component production processes, direct investment joint ventures. this increasingly important way canadian firm maintain cost competitiveness. over medium term, absolutely crucial canadian business government continue take advantage opportunity arise. at time, canadian business government need recognize global development require adjustment canada. there activities, particularly labour-intensive lower-value-added, canadian firm well place compete lower-cost producer asia. the key adjust shift resource expanding, higher-value-added activities, canadian firm exploit opportunity 2 bi review 51/2004 present change world economy. by make adjustments, able increase productivity raise standard live medium term. of course, development asia require u make adjustment canada. we also adjust u.s. economy reduce size fiscal current account deficits. but subject adjustment global imbalance beyond scope remark today. what i say, though, bank canada facilitate whatever adjustment necessary keep inflation low, stable, predictable. this help canadian firm individual read market signal clearly allow make plan confidence future value money. near-term implication global development that's look medium term, important business people economic policy-makers always keep eye horizon. but, run business day day, bank conduct monetary policy, shorter-term development great focus attention. so, let spend minute near-term outlook world economy, outlook imply foreign demand canadian good services. a i say before, emergence china india important impact canadian economy increase demand many commodity produce. this cause run-up price nickel, potash, steel, among others. and, turn, boost income many canadian producers, even take account effect large appreciation canadian dollar saw 2003. of course, high-profile price increase recently oil. very rapid growth asia lead unexpected additional demand oil. for time being, unanticipated demand put pressure market already little spare capacity. over medium term, oil production will, likelihood, increase meet additional demand. but take time new production come line. thus, unreasonable think oil price high near term might expect medium term. our best judgment moment high level growth asia continue next couple years, demand commodity continue grow, although perhaps quite rapidly past couple years. this base not-unreasonable assumption chinese authority able manage economic growth sustainable pace. while development asia likely play important role support continue strength global economy, development unite state still large impact volume canada's export short term. a say july monetary policy report update, recent data point slow u.s. growth red-hot pace second half 2003 first quarter 2004. high oil price appear restrain effect u.s. consumer spending, consumer business seem somewhat le optimistic early year. nevertheless, still expect growth similar forecast july - is, fast growth rate u.s. production capacity. this strong u.s. growth bode well continue high level canadian exports, although unlikely continue grow rapid pace first half year. consistent profile solid u.s. global economic growth expectation financial markets, continue assume upward movement global policy interest rate moderate inflation pressure output level approach production capacity. canada’s economic prospect let turn canada, begin quick recap first half 2004. at start year, say expect net export - difference export import - make significant contribution canada's economic growth 2004 2005, sharp appreciation canadian dollar last year. we also say economic growth would come primarily domestic demand order eliminate excess supply exist start year close output gap. to facilitate growth domestic demand, reduce key policy interest rate 2 3/4 per cent 2 per cent three step early year. bi review 51/2004 3 however, canada's economic performance first half 2004 turn somewhat differently expectations. the volume export grow much rapidly anticipated. so imports, extent exports. a result, net export make significant contribution growth, aggregate demand first half year grow strongly expect begin 2004. so output gap mid-year small projected. indeed, bank judge canadian economy operate close production capacity. a look ahead remainder year 2005, expect export grow slowly first half 2004. but lot uncertainty cloud outlook foreign demand canadian growth. these include uncertainty western grain crop, re-opening u.s. border live cattle exports, auto production, "big three" automaker face soft market products. despite caveats, aggregate demand likely grow rate equal to, marginally above, rate growth production capacity next four quarters. with economy currently operate close capacity, reduce amount monetary stimulus economy two week ago raise key policy interest rate 2 1/4 per cent. inflation, total core, volatile recent months, primarily swing energy price automobile purchase-incentive programs. but despite volatility, continue project core inflation bite 1.5 per cent second half 2004, gradually move 2 per cent target 2005. look forward, need continue reduce monetary stimulus avoid buildup inflationary pressure contribute sustainable, solid economic growth. however, pace action depend continue assessment evolve prospect pressure capacity inflation. in context, several key factor bank watch closely. a always, uncertainty exact size output gap. there also considerable uncertainty time future growth rate export imports, evolution world price energy non-energy commodities. and watch impact geopolitical development global confidence demand. we update outlook canadian economy next monetary policy report, publish 21 october. conclusion let conclude go back early point need adjust change world economy. we certain powerful global economic force i speak today continue felt world economy continue evolve. this evolution lead challenge must face, also lead opportunity must seize. at bank canada, continue monitor global force closely ass impact home abroad. this help u contribute canada's future economic prospect low stable inflation. for canada grow prosper long run, canadian business government need make right adjustment evolve world economy. a leader business community, job easy. but past several years, see ample evidence face challenge take advantage opportunities. i confident continue future. 4 bi review 51/2004 amando m tetangco: the importance risk profession sound risk management practice speech mr amando m tetangco, deputy governor central bank philippines, 2004 convention professional risk managers’ international association philippine chapter, asian institute management, manila, 13 september 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, i please speak today important event - 2004 philippine risk convention. i wish congratulate aim-jbf (asian institute management-jose b. fernandez) center bank finance professional risk managers’ international association organize sponsor gathering; number participant speak well great interest risk management risk profession. my topic importance risk profession sound risk management practice philippines. the risk profession area become growth industry; one particularly relevant bank give fiduciary functions, complexity risk inherent work environment, stability efficiency payment settlement system greatly rest them. allow tackle presentation perspective bsp, regulator philippine financial institution institution end-user staunch promoter risk management. the bsp perform dual role. first, county’s monetary authority, bsp see monetary policy supportive mandate maintain price stability conducive balance sustainable economic growth. second, regulator financial institutions, bsp seek promote soundness financial system, turn, would support overall macroeconomic stability growth. i would first focus current future thrust bsp line second role relate risk management proceed importance risk management, risk profession risk management practices. the need change regulatory approach a crucial moment development risk management occur february 1995 announce bar plc, old bank england lose gbp600 million insolvent result derivative trade activity single trader singapore. at time collapse, bar know conservative, well capitalize historically profitable. the bar case bring light real issue derivative per se, quality management control require modern financial environment. the collapse call question strength exist internal control investment industry aptness adequacy external monitor do exchange regulators. the event demonstrate clearly exist regulatory framework long appropriate continuously change complex market environment. this lead critical reassessment regulatory approach bring change bank supervision approach bank england regulator around world. financial regulatory initiative philippine internal risk management the bsp, part, role bank supervisor take number initiative improve internal risk management among bank adopt basel framework. in march 2001, bsp adopt original basel i circular no. 280. this circular provide guideline computation risk-based capital credit risk. this enhance issuance circular no. 360 december 2002 incorporate market risk risk-based bi review 50/2004 1 capital framework. we also issue circular no. 400 september 2003, extend risk-based capital adequacy requirement quasi-banks. the bsp’s focus supervision ultimately intend give bank great flexibility respond challenge change opportunity deregulate globalize environment amidst rapid technological advances. traditional bank supervision tend instruct bank avoid risk seem high. the new approach supervision favor assessment quality risk management practices, generally allow bank take risk long demonstrate ability assess, measure manage them. we believe good first step good risk management good corporate governance. we thus issue number guideline institute good corporate governance. these include lay guideline govern responsibility duty board director (circular no. 130, june 1997); require bank develop implement compliance system appoint/designate compliance officer oversee implementation (circular no. 145, october 1997); implement fit proper standard director officer bank non-banks include requirement mandatory orientation program corporate governance (circular no. 296, september 2001). this year, bsp issue anew number guideline aim enhance risk management practice banks. in january, bsp issue guideline manage large exposure credit risk concentration bank (circular no. 414). also month, bsp issue guideline capital treatment banks’ investment credit-linked note (clns) similar credit derivative product (circular no. 417). in april 2004, bsp issue guideline treatment compliance risk strengthen banks’ compliance function (circular no. 429). and recently, june 2004, bsp issue guideline development implementation banks’ internal risk rat systems(circular no. 439). journey basel ii the simplify approach basel i successful boost capital level global bank system consider uncomfortably low level throughout late 1970s early 1980s. it major shortcoming, however, “risk weights” poorly represent likelihood sustain loss lack risk sensitivity lead misallocation scarce financial resource hamper long-term economic growth. the new capital accord otherwise know basel ii, formally unveil last june 26, see make capital requirement risk sensitive basel i. it allow great reliance banks’ internal system set capital requirements. more importantly, provide incentive bank continuously improve risk management practices. however, basel ii pose challenge philippine bank bsp. bank develop disciplined, rigorous, auditable approach risk assessment. this challenge many dimension technology address them. for bsp, challenge build technical knowledge supervisory resource validate bank’s risk management systems. we also need examine exist charter see necessary power implement basel ii, particularly pillar 2. the risk management standard practice embody basel ii real draw best practice large internationally active banks. it reflect many insight gather practical experience, include success failure risk management. it contain many useful lesson serve good roadmap improve internal risk management. however, acknowledge aspect basel ii use every bank. for example, quantification tool use large complex institution may necessary small le sophisticate institutions. and risk inherent activity bank internationally active may remote merely active domestically. this reason modify philippine framework take account, local banks’ state readiness, local condition practice consistent nature, complexity materiality local institution’s activities. this also reason provide breathe space thrift rural bank implement basel ii. 2 bi review 50/2004 the bsp line certain project involve study applicability certain basel ii requirement local conditions. these project expect culminate set comprehensive guideline bank plan release late end-2006, implementation 2007. a may aware, pillar 1 basel ii propose standard advance approach credit operational risks. universal/commercial bank expect implement standardize approach basel ii 2007. however, implementation advance approach expect occur perhaps 2010 allow bank time build-up reliable historical database estimate default probability variable important input advance models. foreign bank whose head office use advance approaches, allow use provide show model suit domestic conditions. with regard pillar 2, continue push bank improve risk management practice risk assessment capability corporate governance. with respect pillar 3, appropriate disclosure requirement basel 2 target 2007. bsp’s view importance risk management sound risk management practice on topic importance risk profession risk management practice philippines, i believe could best approach present view significance risk management expectation risk managers. • risk management regulatory report compliance exercise; necessary risk-reducing tool promote long-term profitability stability firm enhance competitive advantage firms. we encourage bank flexibility use internalmodels merely compute level capital need absorb possible loss inherent activities, encourage make rational decision basis risk return considerations. good internal model provide timely information much risk bank take order achieve specific business objectives. internal model must also allow bank compare select, timely basis, among alternative business opportunity strategy solely profit angle also risk standpoint. the philippine adoption basel ii certainly obligate bank cover type risk basis calculations, banks’ capital requirement surely increase say adoption. however, bank right risk management system effectively capture risk exposures, opportunity low capital charges. a financial market progress towards market transparency mechanism promote pillar 3, risk management see potential differentiator source competitive advantage. ultimately, reward bank manage risk effectively, penalize not. good risk management practice thus even essential bank maintain competitiveness long run. • corporate governance mere risk compliance measure; it vital institution’s health. a far bank industry concerned, corporate governance relate manner business affair individual bank direct manage board director senior management. it provide structure though objective institution set, strategy attain objective determine performance institution monitored. corporate governance essential institution’s health. it seek meet legal requirement uphold fiduciary responsibility investors, creditor depositors. it attract retain good senior management, officer employees. it also make organization attractive investors, client business partners. equally important, corporate governance reduce exposure reputational risk potential negative publicity regard institution’s business practice cause decline customer base lead costly litigation. • risk management matter necessary part parcel sound strategic planning. bi review 50/2004 3 the need include risk management strategic plan cannot overemphasize see number bank get trouble root cause trace inconsistency bank’s strategic goal risk management objective simply lack risk management objectives. sound strategic plan involve set target revenue, asset management, number new accounts, also include establishment control risk management systems. specifically strategic plan lead objective assessment institution’s risk profile highlight area strength weaknesses. it help firm determine risk want exposure to, risk cannot avoid, risk firm prepare face risk reduce. strategic plan involve use internal risk assessment could uncover natural hedges, countercyclicalities, exist across different business firm. such knowledge help firm focus net exposure effectively allocate resources. risk assessment often result good understand internal external environment, source competitive advantage uncover business opportunity early assessment threat turn allow firm competitive lead le inform competitors. • stress test enhance management risks. many u today may wish ability predict certainty next crisis strike. regrettably appear exist technology would allow u predict accuracy. however, prepare well advance know would impact us, comes, plan advance right level resource withstand it. we capability perform regular basis, suitable stress test scenario analyses. • a proactive risk culture must exist institution ensure effective risk management a proactive risk culture mean awareness risk within institution permeate action word member firm. this do regular risk awareness activities, education, open communication line among units/groups concerned, continuous interaction senior management. when consider importance risk culture, may ask firm fare good others risk management. nick leeson’s action bar would le likely meaningful “risk culture” place institutionalize management oversight, uphold segregation duties, permit close monitor trade book appear profitable. risk culture important today complexity modern financial instrument make possible even single, unsupervised trader gamble lose, entire capital firm. a good example recent failure risk culture national australia bank. in january 2004, national australia bank(nab), australia’s large bank second big company report lose $360 million foreign currency trading. a report release australian prudential regulation authority attribute loss four currency option trader who, possess abundance self confidence, position nab’s foreign currency option portfolio expectation fall u dollar occur mid last year would reverse volatility would eventually stabilize. rather close position market move them, trader choose conceal true position - allow position deteriorate unchecked period three month finally discovered. the trader able paint rosy picture p&l mask loss amend trade use fictitious trades. by time discovered, position hold totally control. the report highlight risk control failure poor implementation poor design. on paper, nab’s exist control framework able identify contain risk position traders. there many layer nab’s internal control framework, risk management group board included, fail every level detect shut-down irregular currency option trade activity. the nab’s internal governance model, enable timely identification effective 4 bi review 50/2004 quick escalation serious risk issue currency option desk, simply function. have risk control framework implement effectively, loss would certainly substantially less, quite possibly, avert altogether. expectation risk manager • risk management team require diverse set skill knowledge. the many complex risk across organization vary one discipline claim mastery over. a role risk management complex comprehensive, ideal risk management team must make multiple individuals, different set skill knowledge effectively address risk confront institution. integrate staff area trading, research financial control legal, enhance group’s understand business implication risks, ability interact area either fee risk analysis process affect results. • risk management team must independent business unit need interact communicate part firm. risk management need perform independent function, sponsor support senior management. the group particular need separate business unit front office, otherwise would conflict interest firm’s risk would independently measured. however, independence delicate balance act risk management group need communicate business operation group clear understand view markets, products, positions, strategy operational procedure accurately ass risks. in addition business units, risk management group would also interact internal external entities, typically, senior management, financial control, operations, legal/compliance units, regulators, auditors, rat agencies, investor clients. to illustrate interactions, risk management financial control (accounting) must close relationship since performance evaluation long confine simply report return total profit figures, increasingly incorporate measure risk taken. and since financial control maintain book record respect p&l risk control group responsibility risk data, two department must invariably work together. further, public supervisory report use require disclosure traditional financial account information only; however pillar 3, bank may require make public certain material risk information tier capital. in order ensure consistency provide regulatory public reports, financial control risk group must necessarily share database. external auditor country frequently include assessment risk management annual audit, part trend include risk management information annual report comply regulatory approach ensure soundness financial institution. with adoption basel ii framework, expect trend grow globally, include philippines. the risk management group must hence work closely auditor demonstrate clearly measurement methodology used, well completeness support procedures. • risk manager must look beyond organization’s boundaries. the corporate demise enron worldcom show need achieve organization’s vision, mission objective stress extreme events. the proactive risk manager must therefore look beyond organization’s boundary ass impact action wide environment firm operates, include stakeholders, i.e., customers, employees, retirees, suppliers, communities, borrowers, creditor regulators. bi review 50/2004 5 speak regulators, internationally active bank need take account regulation various jurisdiction operate, fact regulatory standard may shift time. • risk manager must effective communicator leader organization. the risk manager must well verse risk management process able effectively communicate lead process within organization mitigate exposure business risks. in support must good understand environment community serve organization, operation different unit relationship different level organization. • risk manager must address corporate governance issue contribute improve corporate governance. the increase anxiety among shareholder due celebrate case account scandal corporate bankruptcy highlight need good corporate governance. corporate governance become issue grow number risk manager give active role manage corporate governance standards. risk manager therefore expect address corporate governance issue contribute improve corporate governance prevent loss enhance long-term sustainability organization. • risk profession must embrace good business ethics. allow tackle subject way enron’s experience risk management. enron maintain risk management function capable employees. line report reasonably independent theory, le practice. the group’s mark-to-market valuation subject adjustment management context, mark-to-market account become mark-to-model accounting. the trader perform trades, too, considerable influence deal marked-to-model. with bonus depend upon profitability deals, unaddressed conflict interest. trade business generate considerable profits, much dubious mark-to-model profits. enron maintain fluid workforce. employee constantly lookout internal transfer. those rotate risk management different. a trader structurer whose deal manager scrutinize one day might position offer risk manager new position next. astute risk manager careful burn bridges. risk manager know would suffer block deal support favorable management-approved mark-to-model valuations. even worse, risk manager subject enron’ “rank yank” system performance review. under system, anyone could contribute feedback anyone, consequence bad review high. risk manager block deal could expect suffer “rank yank”. risk management, thus, become little rubber stamp step stone employee move around company. the enron’s case clearly describe importance ethic risk management profession consequence lack it. a code ethic set forth discipline moral duty conduct support demand standard risk management profession must necessarily place. at minimum, code ethic cover standard integrity dignity, trust, confidentiality, competence professional practice. conclusion to conclude, long term, power computer create analyze huge database change nature risk management. real time, on-line risk analysis reporting, scenario analysis stress test become standard tool day- to- day operations. but important sophisticate system development andadherence institution good corporate governance ? one permeate proactive risk culture. we believe first step good risk management institution implement even absence sophisticate systems. if one good risk management process follow strictly, institution good chance prevent occurrence loss even extreme events. 6 bi review 50/2004 the requirement basel ii amaze even sophisticate risk professional. not need new set improve risk technique technology, also need unlearn old traditional technique become obsolete unreliable. he need constantly aware new market developments, good bad, learn experience mistake others. not that, basel world would require vast amount data inputs, analysis report would place pressure risk professional good job. our view risk management high expectation risk practitioner presented, point vary difficult role risk professional must play. it incumbent upon prepare accept challenge. the lesson learn financial disasters, i mention here, challenge task road basel ii, need integrate risk management strategic plan maintain competitive advantage ensure company long-term survival, - highlight grow importance broaden application risk management consequent increase challenge risk management practitioners. in play increasingly challenge roles, risk practitioners, whatever capacity he/she ? in-house risk manager risk specialist external risk management adviser-- may face key issue lack independence, lack competence specific areas, unclear scope responsibility, unclear legal contractual liability, conflict interest, inconsistency treatment approaches, inadequate inappropriate risk management tool processes, uncertainty result advise recommendation. therefore, order face issue squarely, would ideal professional approach risk management institute system guidance appropriate standard behavior, work practice ethic observe provision risk management services, framework benchmark professional risk management service. it also important system qualification, train education well forum share experience idea improve competency among risk management practitioners. these view importance risk profession sound risk practice employ philippines. may i clarify, nonetheless suggestion also apply non-bank entities. let re-emphasize risk management merely compliance, vital aspect protect enhance institution’s corporate image, gain competitive advantage ensure long-term viability. thank you. bi review 50/2004 7 kishori j udeshi: issue bank regulation supervision speech m

in recognition importance dissemination credit information, rbi require banks/dfis obtain consent borrower - defaulter - dissemination credit information enable credit information bureau india ltd., compile disseminate comprehensive credit information. preserve integrity bank system prevention fraud implementation anti money launder (aml) measure two important aspect effort make prevent criminal misuse financial system threaten stability financial transaction worldwide. supervisory initiative keep view emerge scenario basel ii accord need use supervisory resource productively, begin towards risk-based supervision (rbs) bank made. on basis experience gain extend entire bank system become essential aspect pillar 2 compliance. risk management system i would like flag issue - purely exploratory raise debate rather statement official stance. a aware, position crucial juncture current phase time risk management skill financial entity put test. the liquidity overhang system couple past downward movement interest rate seem spur sense complacency oblivious downside risk adverse interest rate movement. it also apprehend attitude lead bank dilute approach credit risk. the build risk element price credit facility reportedly take backseat pursuit asset expansion. this may leave bank situation player le prepare face reversal interest rate movement, also leave badly price portfolio relation credit quality. i would like aspect appreciate much note alarm voice prudence. credit growth carefully calibrate risk measurement merely see deployment fund marginal cost background sluggish growth. bank look ahead expansion credit portfolio healthy way, particularly background high industrial growth, new plan corporate expansion high level infrastructure financing. couple regulatory requirement management market risks, become increasingly relevant. a well aware, adverse effect risk exposure impact independently tend snowball avalanche. these perhaps time market player begin look concession prudential norms, regulatory forbearance dilution account principles. so would one make situation? • that ill prepare player make loud noise • the weak one make first noise? 2 bi review 50/2004 what lesson learn this? be time bank adopt integrate risk management system whereby effectively address relevant risk ongoing comprehensive manner? should bank think term chief risk officer oversee risk - credit, liquidity, operational market risks? moreover, bank may adopt risk management system various portfolios, few, any, develop risk model suit operations. it occur india cradle it professional wonder provide efficient solution client across world. it also matter pride indian helm affair large global banks. in circumstances, surprise bank india lag behind tap it potential country put productive use develop / apply risk models. a compare potential available country, extent application talent bank relatively low, especially benefit derive tremendous. a concurrent question emerge whether bank think term disclose investor large risk management policy indicate also risk containment practice strategy pursue bank, line statement make chairman large corporates. at present, disclosure cannot make mandatory consider level maturity financial sector level assimilation information stake holder public. bank confident pursue well define strategy take account clear strength articulate philosophy run bank annual reports. encourage bank certainly help improve perception concern bank eye public market. it should, however, well think step, consider bank’s major asset trust repose public large nothing do undermine level confidence. we recently issue guideline bank maintenance capital charge market risks. in addition, bank also require draw strategy meet capital requirement arise implementation basel 2. bank tap traditional instrument eligible capital status, namely equity share subordinate debt instruments. the present legal framework allow bank raise capital issue preference shares. there also certain restriction maximum tenure preference shares. this give rise uneven play field also raise issue pertain eligibility redeemable preference share capital status, especially regard inclusion tier i tier ii. in view uncertainty largely untapped source capital india. with view enable bank tap source reserve bank examine amendment exist legislation. through proper structuring, preference capital may make attractive meet need section investors. we need explore carefully option also raise capital hybrid instrument define basel

“onshore europe”, organise malta financial service authority, st julians, 13 september 2004. * * * the title choose conference significant brief. the two word “onshore europe” neatly capture malta’s current reality, financial centre solid credential afford player guarantee opportunity offer single european market financial services. a commemorate malta’s first ten year international financial centre, appropriate record able look back satisfaction past achievements, legislator political vision adopt consensual approach task hand 1994. this involve radical overhaul exist law draft new one lay foundation modern financial centre govern high standard yet flexible enough allow new opportunity growth development seize country’s economic advantage. i would, therefore, like pay tribute saw project successful conclusion. an analysis malta’s track record lead another important conclusion, place appropriate legislative institutional framework necessary, sufficient condition success. recent experience around world suggest potential financial centre cannot maximize unless posse another essential attribute. that ingredient stability aspect i propose explore today. ensure financial stability statutory responsibility central bank malta. the bank thus oblige participate actively maintenance stable efficient financial system contribute towards development. this apply payment settlement system, bank regulator, entire financial system. the bank on-going role play assess robustness system. it must draw attention problem ensure way impede function financial market efficient provider capital company households. the bank’s approach therefore consider general risk system rather situation individual credit financial institutions. the latter task malta financial service authority (mfsa), successfully assumed, last ten years, full responsibility supervision institution provide financial services. why central bank promote financial stability there several reason maintenance healthy financial sector essential function central banks, irrespective involvement otherwise regulation supervision. first, virtue role provider liquidity bank system involvement payment systems, central bank vest interest quality counterparties. any development could affect financial health counterparties direct interest central bank, least inability former honour commitment would negative financial implication central bank. furthermore, instability financial system could hind central bank successfully pursue objectives, particularly achievement price stability monetary policy measures. indeed, monetary policy implement effectively financial system stable, financial intermediary respond change interest rate liquidity condition engineer central bank, thus transmit impulse non-financial intermediaries. at time, pursue price stability central bank contribute directly financial stability, since stable price environment reduce volatility financial variable ensure smooth function markets. from central bank perspective, also evident healthy financial system contribute stability exchange rate particularly where, country like malta, fix exchange regime coexist absence capital controls. thus, situation concern robustness financial infrastructure, regulatory framework integrity financial intermediaries, external account may undermine sizeable outflow capital. in bi review 50/2004 1 words, start crisis individual institution could easily develop balance payment currency crisis, may, turn, trigger secondary effect throughout rest financial sector, disrupt sector economy process thus result full-blown financial crisis. in case central bank malta, consideration assume even great importance give maltese economy’s small size, openness lack natural resources, make highly dependent foreign markets. the small size domestic market, moreover, also implication save investment. thus limit pool save turn reflect low volume internally generate resource investment purposes, make country highly dependent external financing. this dependence evidence private save ratio, low international standards, around 22% gdp, also fall recent year public sector imbalance widen unsustainable proportions. the central bank malta’s approach financial stability against economic background, therefore, price exchange rate stability assume particular importance need stable financial environment become crucial. the maintenance financial stability accordingly recognize legislation set central bank malta 1968, pursuant 2002 amendment legislation bank’s responsibility make explicit.1 these amendment also recognize bank’s role preserve sound efficient payment system. the bank’s effort strengthen capacity area financial stability commence responsibility bank regulation supervision transfer malta financial service authority (mfsa) january 2002. in fact 2000, financial stability office set identify analyse potential systemic threat banks, also part financial system, insurance investment sectors, security market also select large corporation non-financial sector. the office since develop set financial soundness indicator model detect ass impact different type risks. it also introduce shock scenario technique stress-test resilience bank system. this year bank also start conduct bi-annual financial stability review whereby development abroad well domestic macroeconomic, regulatory operational environment assess one analytical framework design detect potential weakness devise appropriate remedial measures. these activity supplement work bank’s payment system office, responsible maintenance oversight payment system. this important function modern electronic payment system potential serve channel contagion transmit payment difficulty one, few, large financial intermediary others system. in 2002 retail gross settlement system base bank international settlements’ ten core principles2 introduce malta inter-bank domestic payment order transmitted, clear settle great efficiency previously. the bank also issue number directive seek provide participate bank adequate degree protection legal systemic risk associate participation systems. other directive seek ensure right banks’ client adequate information concern retail payment uphold intermediary render payment services. in way, credibility integrity infrastructure use settlement payment preserve wholesale retail level. the bank’s role financial stability recently enhance membership european system central bank (escb) may 2004. it start participate escb 1 the 1967 act refer bank’s role promote sound financial structure foster orderly capital market malta. article 4 (2) revise act specifically state shall one objective bank “ensure stability financial system.” 2 the core principle recommend committee payment security settlement system bank international settlement (bis). 2 bi review 50/2004 committee deal financial stability, bank supervision committee, eu level bank also participate economic finance committee financial stability table. the importance two-way cooperation mfsa the initiative i describe strengthen bank’s ability monitor analyse development financial system wide context. it nevertheless become increasingly clear carry role effectively, bank’s effort area need support activity overall supervisor financial field, mfsa. it is, therefore, reassure note good co-operation already exist bank authority. more specifically, authority’s focus health individual service provider complement bank’s macroprudential analysis financial system whole oversight payment settlement systems. in undertake respective tasks, institution access information may readily available other. thus, example, involvement payment system daily monitor banks’ foreign exchange exposures, central bank malta daily information amount liquidity extent foreign exchange risk prevalent inter-bank market. similar information, however, become available authority delay, monthly statistical report submit individual financial intermediaries. furthermore, bank’s macro perspective assessment financial development may identify general risk system may apparent prudential supervision individual financial institution undertaken. this may occur, example, risk profile institution question show high degree similarity, make system especially vulnerable particular type shock. supervision micro level, therefore, complement macro analysis interlinkages different segment domestic financial sector link payment system, rest economy counterpart abroad. on hand, also true bank’s macroprudential analysis may provide precise information individual institutions, particularly may brink insolvency. here, authority, regular inspection individual service provider in-depth knowledge health single intermediary market segments, include play peripheral role monetary policy transmission process bank’s relationship is, least one-to-one basis, rather distant. in sense, authority also contribute soundness bank’s counterparties. it also authority ensure sound institution license enter maltese market. furthermore, confidential supervisory information available authority could useful bank input overall analysis financial system, enable respond liquidity relate constraint could set negative ripple effects. the potential synergy two institution prompt sign two memoranda understand 2002 provide enhance co-operation, include establishment stand committee. this cooperation framework contribute general soundness stability financial system. the profitability banks, example, remain stable average return asset tax 0.8% 2003, level record european banks. furthermore, bank liquidity capitalization level remain strong. liquid asset hold percentage short-term liability close 53% end 2003, compare minimum threshold 30%. meanwhile, banks’ aggregate capital adequacy ratio, define ratio fund risk-weighted assets, currently stand 23%, compare minimum 8%. in insurance sector collective investment scheme steady growth continue registered. this positive performance notwithstanding, remain scope improvement framework bank authority seek safeguard health domestic financial system. it become increasingly evident, example, proper analysis system’s robustness require detail statistic entity data currently either available fragmented. this particularly case non-bank financial sector, also corporate household sectors, although latter area progress make joint effort bank, authority national statistic office. bi review 50/2004 3 another aspect warrant particular attention financial crisis management. while current institutional regulatory framework successful keep bay major systemic disturbance, progress required, example define specific role responsibility bank, authority government. in respect, joint contingency plan systemically important bank drawn-up bank authority already take account involvement ministry finance respect possible use public fund bank’s lender last resort function. this framework currently process refine further. the need improve cross-border cooperation on hand, matter concern whereas modality crisis management been, process formalise effectively jurisdictions, include malta, way forward resolution crisis cross-border nature, require prompt intervention central bank supervisor operate different time zone different day-to-day practices, yet clearly defined. some progress respect make eu level formalisation memoranda understand escb high-level principle co-operation crisis management situation payment system overseer bank supervisors. however, agreements, central bank malta mfsa also party, go far enough. the implication systemic crisis whose resolution would, example, require form fiscal input possibly also contribution entity span different jurisdiction yet articulated. this issue hopefully address forthcoming review eu bank codify directive march 2000. a two key institution financial stability responsibilities, bank authority direct interest future evolution international co-operative arrangements. such arrangements, moreover, also impact way two institution seek co-operate similar authority base abroad. in particular, activity institution bank authority expect monitor become complex number financial intermediary presence malta countries, either directly establishment branch subsidiaries, indirectly provision cross-border service via internet otherwise, continue grow light incorporation eu passporting right maltese legislation. the come effect basle ii and, eu level, cad iii significant factor regard. at time, tendency company seek multiple list different security market mean interest rate stock market valuation one country increasingly mirror countries, even though underlie economic fundamental country might warrant divergence variables. indeed, experience countries, trend towards consolidation merger activity various segment market, bank sell insurance investment fund provision payment service trade facilities, lead situation institution supervise vastly exceed financial resource technical expertise available supervisor central banks. this accentuate current trend whereby financial intermediary outsource activity domestic cross-border level, introduction european union directive european single company statute, call societas europea, present new regulatory financial stability challenge regional level. the implication international development malta these observation particularly relevant malta. first, whereas size complexity financial intermediaries, corporate entity exposed, grow disproportionately relative resource available regulator liquidity provider across globe, divergence magnify small jurisdiction ours. second, characteristic maltese economy make vulnerable development abroad, financial sector especially expose change perception foreign investor sustainability prevail economic policy capacity financial sector absorb external shocks. 4 bi review 50/2004 give ease fund move country, moreover, scope disparity size economy foreign institutional investors, need maintain confidence domestic financial sector assume particular importance. this risk accentuate fact sector economy operate competitive environment, many sector business remain concentrate among small set market players. the financial sector exception regard. furthermore, structure domestic financial sector evolve considerably time, level development still fall short advance eu member states. thus, example, although past year number player non-bank sector increase term number variety, financial intermediation malta remain largely bank-based. within domestic bank sector, moreover, two bank together account around 90% total loan deposits. a similar picture emerge capital market degree capitalisation, number market participant volume turnover still relatively low. in 2003, example, ratio stock market capitalisation gdp stand 37%. while high new member states, around half euro area average. annual turnover even lower, hover around 4% gdp 12% stock market capitalization. where, malta, performance financial sector hinge crucially fate small number player lack depth liquidity capital market often cause market value particular debt instrument deviate underlie fundamentals, risk contagion within system, well as, system accentuated.3this latter aspect might become le relevant financial service provider malta eu respond introduction financial service action plan eventual establishment single market financial services. on positive side, initiative provide good income-earning liquidity management opportunities, improve efficiency sector operate enhance capacity weather sector-specific shocks. on hand, advent liberalisation heighten level competition could well spur service provider domicile malta take new risk venture non-traditional line business. furthermore, result passporting rights, competition likely become acute. the ensue interdependence different sector country could well expose domestic system new vulnerabilities, include possible contagion systemic shocks. this especially case upon malta’s entry euro area move would provide momentum pace financial market integration. moreover, eventual linkage domestic payment system target also facilitate transmission certain risks, least operational nature. conclusion there clearly several good reason sound regulatory oversight practice remain vital stability financial system why, therefore, central bank malta mfsa must work effectively together. it also evident, however, two institution cannot provide full protection systemic disturbances, modality co-operation place locally need strengthen extend body comparable responsibility international, particularly eu level. 3 ecb. 2002. financial sector eu accession countries. bi review 50/2004 5 zhou xiaochuan: anti-money launder china - status quo prospect speech mr

future challenge let begin give brief glimpse reach today. the financial sector witness radical shift introduction reform process 1992. the focus reform deregulation liberalisation especially bank sector major component financial sector country. the bank sector reform guide primarily recommendation committee financial system (narasimham committee, 1991) related, among others, (a) reduction level statutory pre-emptions, (b) dismantle complex structure administer interest rates, (c) lay capital adequacy requirements; (d) introduction prudential norm (e) liberalisation entry norm domestic foreign banks. at macro level, firstly reduction level preemption banks’ resources. the statutory liquidity ratio (slr) reduce 38.5 percent 1991-92 25 percent. the average cash reserve ratio (crr) reduce 15 percent 1991-92 4.5 percent now. secondly, interest rate deregulated. the number administer interest rate bank advance reduce 20 1989-90 2 1994-95. interest rate loan rs. 2 lakh fully

financial asset enforcement security interest (sarfaesi) act, 2002 provide statutory support enforcement creditors’ right inter alia, pave way establishment asset reconstruction companies. fourthly, debt recovery tribunal set assist bank recovery loans. fifthly, scheme ombudsman introduce 1995, look resolve customer grievances. sixthly, state bank india act, 1955 bank nationalisation act 1970 amend enable bank access capital market debt equity. lastly, reform also introduce respect regional rural bank (rrbs) non-bank finance company (nbfcs). the measure together strengthen prudential norm market discipline adoption international benchmark suit india specific need serve make indian financial sector competitive, viable resilient. bi review 49/2004 1 financial crisis world reveal weak financial system supervision important factor contribute macro instability. a east asia discover painfully, health bank system underpin economy whole. financial market different product market therefore, great liberalisation go along deep supervision high degree regulation. any destablisation financial market affect even financial markets. on hand, financial market drive real economy. therefore, transparency, disclosures, prudential norm capitalisation must. this essential bank depositor security except bank well regulated. increase deregulation globalisation, great competition within country cross-border deal expose bank even great risk. diversification non-traditional product like insurance, derivative etc., add complexity bank business. further, internet banking, e-commerce, e-money information technology relate innovation add new dimension risk face bank sector. merger acquisition well outsource non-core activity undertake bank strategic objective - also enhance risk banking. consider speed bank changing, recognise need enlarge focus thrust risk-based supervision (rbs) able improve risk sensitivity supervisory approach. in view relevance improve risk management system change circumstance large emphasis place risk management system bank basel ii, essential rb stabilise early date serf important feedback management also supervisors. however, take account diversity indian bank system, stabilise rb effective supervisory mechanism daunt task. consolidation move towards universal bank we slowly surely move regime “large number small banks” “small

grindlays demonstrate trend towards consolidation almost accept fact. we also look sign respect number old private sector banks, many able cushion npas, expand business induct technology due limit capital base. come time may usher large bank institutions, development financial institution opt conversion commercial bank line recommendation second report narsimhan committee. in india, one large financial institutions, icici, take lead towards universal bank reverse merger icici bank. idbi also well way transform universal bank. this may lead logically promote concept financial super market chain, make available type credit non-funded facility one roof specialise subsidiary one umbrella organisation. the set bank financial institution non-banking financial company set insurance, merchant banking, mutual funds, house finance investment company either subsidiary joint venture bring focus need consolidate supervision. consolidate account supervisory technique would evolve appropriate firewall need build address risk underlie large organisation bank conglomerates. supervision/regulation financial conglomerate the financial landscape increasingly witness entry big bank financial segment like merchant banking, insurance etc., make financial conglomerates. emergence several new player diversify presence across major segment possibility non-banking institution financial sector acquire large enough proportion systemic impact make imperative supervision spread across various segment financial sector. in direction, inter-regulatory work group constitute member rbi, sebi irda. the framework propose group complementary exist regulatory structure wherein individual entity regulate respective regulator identify financial conglomerate would subject focus regulatory oversight mechanism inter-regulatory exchange information. 2 bi review 49/2004 risk management capital adequacy financial sector reform current millennium go focus set rule game financial intermediary way risk take adequate level capital. in words, financial intermediary free engage asset liability management allow diversify risk long support level capital sufficient cushion risk profile. the first capital accord 1988 evolve basel committee provide framework fair reasonable degree consistency application capital standards. however, method use determine capital charge credit risk accord sufficiently sophisticate perceive risk sensitive. keep view financial innovation grow complexity financial transactions, need felt broad base flexible framework capital adequacy. towards end basel committee formulate new framework, popularly call “basel ii” attempt formulate precisely level regulatory capital bank must hold cushion credit risk bank take. cross-border supervision this would involve great focus overseas operation indian bank information share arrangement overseas supervisor firm formal footing. in context money launder concern raise supervisors, need ensure branches, especially compliant anti-money launder principle financial action task force (fatf), cause serious operational reputational risk parent bank india. money launder although i touch upon issue brief early discuss cross border supervision, i would like dwell little bite issue engage attention governments, regulator international financial community quite time. and exaggeration i call big challenge supervisor today. post september 11, issue bank supervisor world grapple “how root menace money laundering?” until recently, government talk tough problem, little it. all change three year ago. the fatf conceive g-7 country helpful mechanism persuade government combat money launder offer technical assistance so. the law enact typically require bank “know customer” confident money obtain legitimate means, report suspicious activity. this involve herculean effort, thank part, growth “correspondent bank relationships.” in effect, mean bank must know customers’ customer well. bank supervision world achieve delicate balance respect customer privacy make bank report suspicious transactions. this raise tough question: what exactly effort money launder try achieve? so far, country free define regard illegal source money. some include drugs, racketeer dark crime definition illegal money. some, france, consider tax evasion money laundering. others like switzerland flexible laws. however, recently last week, switzerland agree principle dismantle veil secrecy govern bank activity order comply anti-money launder requirements. this landmark development. corporate governance i would also like touch upon area, go focus next generation financial sector reforms. one late initiative rbi aim enhance level corporate governance banks. in view special status enjoy bank whereby freely accept deposit public leverage fund credit creation, legal prescription ownership governance bank lay bank regulation act, 1949. these supplement bi review 49/2004 3 regulatory prescription issue reserve bank time

financial services, u house representatives, washington, 8 september 2004. * * * introduction thank chairman oxley rank member frank, invite discus matter significant importance country: protect financial infrastructure. a approach september 11, i would like take moment honor memory lose life honor support one another september 11, 2001. although financial sector year experience deal operational disruption cause weather, power, critical infrastructure outages, september 11 attack profound effect industry think physical cyber security well business-continuity planning. after crisis subsided, sector participants, include federal reserve, reflect lesson learn incorporate daily business process business-resumption planning. my remark today highlight action federal reserve take september 11 immediately follow maintain confidence restore operation financial system. i also focus numerous step financial regulator take since september 11 improve resilience - protect - financial infrastructure. response september 11 on tuesday, september 11, terrorist destroy portion critical infrastructure support u.s. financial markets, disrupt communication networks, force numerous market participant move contingency sites. these challenges, along tragic loss employee major financial firms, complicate trading, clearing, settlement number financial instruments. operational disruption cause uncertainty payment flows, make difficult reserve market channel fund need most. depository institution hold reserve balance prefer difficulty place deliver excess market; hand, depository institution await fund scramble cover overdraft positions. a result, market participant experience significant liquidity dislocations, demand reserve grow rapidly. the federal reserve accommodate demand reserve variety means, relative importance shift week. on tuesday morning, shortly attacks, federal reserve issue press release state “the discount window available meet liquidity needs,” thus reassure financial market federal reserve system function normally. borrow depository institution surge record $45.5 billion wednesday. federal reserve discount loan bank meet liquidity need drop sharply thursday return low level friday. separately, overnight overdraft tuesday wednesday rise several billion dollars, handful depository institution account federal reserve force overdraft position reserve accounts. overdraft return negligible level end week. like u.s. counterparts, foreign financial institution operate unite state face elevate dollar liquidity needs. in cases, however, institution encounter difficulty position collateral u.s. branch secure federal reserve discount window credit. to position help meet enhance need funds, three foreign central bank establish new expand arrangement federal reserve receive u.s. dollar exchange respective currencies. these swap lines, last thirty days, consist $50 billion european central bank, $30 billion bank england, increase $8 billion (from $2 billion $10 billion) bank canada. the european central bank draw line week channel fund institution need dollars. bi review 49/2004 1 during week, disruption air traffic cause federal reserve extend record level credit depository institution form check float. float increase dramatically federal reserve continue credit account bank check deposited, even though ground

exclusively overnight transaction several days. the injection reserve open market operation peak $81 billion friday. the combine infusion liquidity various source cause level reserve balance federal reserve bank rise $100 billion wednesday, september 12 - ten time normal level. in addition accommodate heighten demand reserves, federal reserve take several step facilitate market function wake september 11 attacks. for example, hour fund security transfer system u.s. government agency security operate federal reserve significantly extend week attacks. from september 11 21st, federal reserve reduce eliminate penalty charge overnight overdrafts, largely overdraft almost entirely result extraordinary development beyond control account holders. for four week attacks, federal reserve bank new york liberalize term would lend security system portfolio, amount security lend rise record level second half september. the federal reserve work national communication system (ncs) also assist market participant restore telecommunication services. the market financial market authority work hard restore operations, market activity resume relatively quickly attacks. by week follow september 11, financial system largely begin function normally, although activity address aftermath attack continue time. step take since september 11 protect financial infrastructure within week september 11, initiate self-assessment contingency arrangement across federal reserve embark forty initiatives, classify five broad headings: • ensure continuity federal reserve operations. • ensure market liquidity crisis. • ensure effective communication coordination crisis. • improve resilience private-sector financial system infrastructure. • improve resilience telecommunication infrastructure support critical financial services. some key step federal reserve take improve infrastructure delivery critical central-bank financial service include following: • we develop plan ensure critical

immediate step work together identify new vulnerability expose september 11. these effort coordinate umbrella president’s work group financial markets, financial bank infrastructure information committee (fbiic), and, depository institution specifically, federal financial institution examination council (ffiec). the agency implement duty officer program develop communication protocol deal staffs, regulate financial institutions, public. we also develop test facility secure communication among agencies. the agency participate fbiic, include federal reserve, direct supervisory regulatory responsibility financial sector assess potential system vulnerabilities. we share information department homeland security (dhs). indeed, i would like commend dhs work share information coordinate

prime minister minister finance chairman board director ioib chief executive staff ioib lady gentleman good afternoon i please midst open goodlands branch indian ocean international bank ltd. i understand indian ocean international bank quite sometime implement plan strengthen financial stand also process enhance corporate image. the bank far make good measure progress endeavour. i would like urge board director maintain speed progress zeal vigour finish. poor corporate governance major cause weakness bank bank failure mauritius. to board director indian ocean international bank board director bank operate mauritius, i would like say adherence good corporate governance principle indisputably key maintenance sound solid financial stand financial institutions. a bank, however small, good corporate culture far strong big bank poor corporate governance principles. in past year bank mauritius issue bank comprehensive set guidelines, include corporate governance principle require adhere to. while virtually banker dispute necessity impose principle guidelines, many industry view cumbersome demanding. it true relative way bank business use conduct recently mauritius, regulatory requirement indeed demanding. we cannot, however, overlook fundamentally important fact regulatory requirement serve best interest depositors. and bank mauritius, regulator industry, protect interest depositors. regulation design shape good behaviour bankers. they aim establish discipline conduct bank business promote corporate habit fair also transparent market participants. in process, regulation also help create condition conducive sound development financial markets. often come across rogue shareholder rogue board members. company commonly face typical problem; it’s agency problem sit heart corporate governance. certain board member bank industry, rather guide principle best serve interest banks, often use authority advance agenda. this attitude anathema principle good governance. in bank industry, integrity palpable mark distinction. by integrity i mean board member make decision quick buck. it mean board member solely transaction-driven; long-term benefit company well clients. it also mean that, thing go well, board member stand client thing go well take unfair advantage it. while profit make remain principal motive enterprise capitalist system, usurious attitude bank business quite often bring seed self-destruction. the good banker formulate educate view execute decision professional life. i receive many complaint bank customer last five years. few complaint i receive seem reasonable. most complaints, investigations, find unreasonable. it common feature borrower pay sufficient attention content contract sign borrowing. often borrower tend swallow chew. it’s panic banker finally apply sword. my appreciation situation lead believe bi review 49/2004 1 banker borrower share blame. to borrower i would like say: refrain borrow sum money beyond repayment capacity. to bankers, i would like reiterate should, right outset, ensure borrower repayment capacity disburse fund them. some bank it; don’t. we contemplate anti-collusive measures. lately, various interpretation give monetary policy stance bank mauritius. five year ago, bank mauritius tighten monetary policy stance rate interest gradually rise high levels. the prevail condition warrant tightening. it commonplace economy undergo cyclical changes. the set policy appropriate particular phase economic cycle may necessarily appropriate different phase cycle objective bank’s policy achieved. that bank mauritius re-oriented policy stance bring reduction rate interest last two years. the successive reduction rate interest help alleviate financial burden enterprise export process zone (epz). to extent monetary policy go accommodate interest various economic sector without compromise mandate bank mauritius clear enlighten observers. there limit monetary policy bank deliver. the problem epz mostly management market-related. the emerge problem sugar industry also market-related. the problem definitively root exchange rate rupee. it inappropriate speculate deliberate step cause rupee depreciate policy agenda bank mauritius. this perception incorrect. world price oil attain unprecedented levels. it evidently impact domestic price level. a depreciation rupee, trigger oral stimulus, would exacerbate inflationary pressure economy. lady gentlemen, say let reiterate support board director management ioib effort put far steer bank troubles. i wish best success. thank you. 2 bi review 49/2004 zdeněk tůma: the importance statistic - central banker’s view introductory speech mr zdeněk tůma, governor czech national bank, conference “statistics - investment future”, prague, 6 september 2004. * * * good morning, lady gentlemen, let join distinguish colleague, head czech statistical office, mr fischer welcome conference czech national bank’s congress centre. one reason czech national bank co-organising event involvement statistical field consequently close co-operation czech statistical office. statistic somewhat overlook general public perceive area primary significance, unlike matter privatisation, corruption, bankruptcies, problem bank sector, function courts, law enforcement major transformation issues. the le statistic subject attention-grabbing article report media, systematic work requires. work often demanding, particularly regard data consistency detail profiles. indeed, level detail subject sensitive evaluation. that why, one difficult task statistic strike balance amount information require burden lay respondents. statistical information use passive monitor past development disclosure statistical publications, also basis real-life decision-making economic agents. statistical data use various negotiations. there many examples. wage bargain strongly affect evolution prices. so-called “inflation clauses” form part many agreements, example rental contracts. statistical data also serve basis decision various authorities. central bank specific category. they significantly affect economic environment. to able perform duty properly, central bank need high-quality statistical information. “nothing important monetary policy good statistics”. this alexander lamfalussy, former president european monetary institute, predecessor european central bank, characterise importance statistic successful monetary policymaking. this year mark fifteenth anniversary path transformation centrally control economy market economy. all area life undergo dramatic changes, statistic exception. in early 1990s, czech national bank work close co-operation international monetary fund. individual mission visit u several time year. statistic one first area co-operation established. this entirely logical, since without creation basic statistical framework would possible communicate monetary policy matters. among important outcome creation monetary survey. this survey make possible compile monetary credit aggregates. one precondition influence money supply establish know “monetary base”. the ongoing liberalisation process mean long important divide balance payment statistic koruna foreign currency transactions. this classification replace standard breakdown transaction resident non-residents. numerous statistic link regulation gradually abolish individual area economic activity liberalised. these example merely illustrate central bank’s entire statistical system rebuild scratch. let move recent past. in 1999 begin co-operate closely european institutions. the main topic include monetary bank statistics, balance payment statistic recently also financial accounts, government financial statistic general economic statistics. the development statistic influence need standardise area ensure compatibility eu member state candidate countries. hand hand contacts, begin work much closely czech statistical office. in area statistic czech statistical office natural close partner czech national bank, since two institution major producer statistical information czech republic. the czech statistical office conduct far wide range statistical surveys, provide aggregate information national economy, territory, climate, environment, population, election area life activity country. the czech national bank user economic bi review 49/2004 1 statistic collaborate closely area. a user partner, affirm quality office’s statistical output increase immensely transformation period. example include publication national account accord international standard compilation data government debt deficit. the czech national bank focus mainly monetary bank statistic balance payment statistics. the harmonisation monetary statistic european standard recently complete main component - balance sheet statistic interest rate statistics. monetary credit aggregate interest rate methodologically comparable data eu member states. speak harmonisation, i must mention calculation another convergence criterion - long-term interest rates. this calculation base long-term government bond yield secondary market. the czech national bank thus provide statistical foundation assess criterion. international standard imf’s 5th balance payment manual also observe compile balance payments. the balance payment publish every month require item also break geographically. in recent years, much attention devote category foreign direct investment, data publish detail geographical sectoral breakdowns. the balance payment perhaps best example co-operation czech statistical office czech national bank. co-operation essential many areas, since basic indicator country’s economic performance, example gross domestic product, cannot compile without data trade services, supply czech national bank, and, conversely, balance payment cannot compile without data foreign trade goods, supply czech statistical office. however, work contact run much deeper, among thing exchange information maintain up-to-date register collaborate eliminate duplication effort collect statistical data respondents. there close co-operation field methodology. one recent example joint preparation new method monitor real estate price ensure data up-to-date possible. daily contact also maintain area data publication, example present information special data dissemination standard project, imf standard adopt czech republic end 1990s. there enough time forum list joint activities. i think, however, czech national bank’s involvement organise conference prof co-operation two institution fruitful. lady gentlemen, i wish statistical conference every success hope session live expectations. i also wish pleasant stay czech national bank well prague. 2 bi review 49/2004 philipp m hildebrand: ten theory economic relationship switzerland - europe summary speech dr philipp m hildebrand, member

4 bi review 48/2004 bandid nijathaworn: regional financial cooperation - think way forward speech mr bandid nijathaworn, deputy governor bank thailand, apec finance development program annual forum, sanya, china, 28 november 2004. * * * thank mr chairman, i would like begin thank ministry finance people’s republic china afdp secretariat invite speak afternoon sanya. it pleasure honour here, especially presence many distinguish expert policy maker region. today, i ask speak regional financial cooperation. this subject know well one many u spend lot time work past years. give limitation time, i would like focus talk today make two points. the first highlight key achievement make regional financial cooperation. next, i would like share think way forward, especially measure take strengthen process financial cooperation region. first, achievement i think doubt lot progress make regional financial cooperation past years. this progress drive combination factors, important asian financial crisis itself, prompt policy maker region recognize potential benefit financial cooperation mechanism allow region prevent good manage risk financial crisis. since 1997-98 crisis, regional financial cooperation strengthen three main ways: the first strengthen liquidity arrangements, second introduction regular policy dialogue surveillance, third coordination effort develop region’s bond market. so far, progress make include expand network bilateral swap agreement asean plus three country chiang mai initiative provide short-term liquidity. there also formal informal asean+3 finance central bank meet exchange information discus policy issues, well discussion apec platform. also, new development asian bond market initiative apec forum also launch develop region’s bond market. my point achievement important realization would possible without awareness determination authority concern make happen. but notwithstanding progress made, definitely do bring regional financial cooperation level par region’s economic financial potentials. this say although economy east asia recover path sustain growth, regional financial cooperation need continue substantially move forward. the rationale clear: first, financial cooperation lead fast pace comprehensive development region’s financial markets. such development crucial sustain momentum intra-regional trade investment, factor instrumental region’s recent economic success. go forward, momentum intra regional trade investment potential become major source growth region, promotion region’s domestic demand. second, globalize flow finance capital, maintain financial market stability key condition preserve macroeconomic stability. to achieve this, addition pursuance sound economic financial policies, asian region also need financial arrangement. such arrangement help ensure orderly stable financial environment emerge vulnerability would pose serious risk region’s financial market 1/3 economies. important context, i believe, region finance facility draw region’s financial strength resources. with facility, would great confidence amongst policy maker region capability capacity look market economy major financial distress. on basis rationale, view regional financial cooperation move progressively forward, process strengthen work become focused, aim produce tangible results. let spare think way forward. on issue, i say outset point i go make new, probably already familiar you. the first chiang mai initiative cmi. cmi create conceptually short-term finance facility help participate member manage balance payment shortfall time financial distress. although economy east asia much strong five year ago, cmi continue remain key pillar regional financial cooperation. this important region liquidity arrangement call upon need arises. with crisis behind us, time think best improve exist facility. and, one way approach look way credibly turn exist arrangement facility emphasize great level resource commitment participate members. this say request member position count facility need arises. look improvement angle, i think three way reflect upon. the first make size arrangement large meaningful respect possible need members. the second simplicity activation process, especially first tranche. this important give assurance participate member liquidity make available timely manner. and third objective turn cmi multilateral facility late stage. this last feature, realized, provide region financial arrangement help expand region’s capability safeguard financial stability. lt go without say move emphasize great resource commitment member entail substantial strengthen current regional surveillance process. this development welcome. strengthen surveillance process fact key prior condition expand cmi help make cmi process credible reduce risk moral hazard. cmi currently review. i hope point i touch upon explored. but whatever outcome review may be, i confident signify another important step forward regional financial cooperation. my second think region’s bond market. economist region long make know view asia region surplus savings, financial surplus asia effectively utilize benefit economy asia. this clearly miss opportunity. to bridge shortcoming, region’s financial market need substantially expand develop region’s market effectively allocate surplus save within asian region. the current focus regional bond market development therefore step right direction. but point today develop bond market important, two additional area market development tandem work bond market also look ensure balance development financial infrastructure asia. the first human resource: need build steady supply high quality financial personnel serve asian financial markets. in short term, issue partly address promote great role asian financial institution cross-border transaction business within asian market. the expand role asian financial institution enhance experience asian financial firm cross-border transaction help transfer financial skill technology among market participant region. for long term, think establish regional finance institute aim specifically train develop financial personnel asian market. to me, type initiative look practical economically feasible asia’s large domestic market always call substantial demand train financial personnel. such institute also play important role 2/3 support development financial market asia, well produce next generation asian financiers. the second area also consider harmonization streamline exist rule regulations. this especially important cross--border capital movement region’s financial resource flow smoothly economy region. streamline rule regulation help reduce unnecessary barriers, low transaction costs, allow efficient allocation resources. for example, measure protect domestic market outside competition may need relaxed. along line, room harmonize tax capital market transaction tax implication neutral act constraint efficient resource allocation. lady gentlemen, my last think today way proceed expedite pace regional financial cooperation. at juncture, disagreement would like see fast progress regional financial cooperation. and, ensure progress, see policy maker asia ready prepare take bold important policy actions. my view also same. i also want see fast pace development rather slow one. but one also need underscore that, achieve long term sustainability continuity, process development need market drive rather policy driven. this important ensure resource would allocate efficiently direction development would line need markets, reflect private sector’s priority expectations. at initial stage development, case asian bond market, government policy effort important spearhead process growth development. but momentum take off, market mechanism take ensure pace focus development consistent market expectations. and, level, role policy support facilitate market development streamline rule regulations, facilitate cross-border trade investment flows, provide necessary financial infrastructure. this approach help ensure region’s financial environment remain conducive private sector activity participation. let take opportunity stress that, juncture financial market development asia, i think support authority still important remain crucial factor. but order leverage impact government’s support involvement fullest, important authority clear firm commitment develop markets. government involvement also focus concentrate issue cannot tackle private market participants. importantly, authority engage private sector early process market development direction policy development align need private sector. most issue i raise today new, important ones. again, i surprise many also thoughts. such convergence idea good help advance interest work regional financial cooperation. i confident move forward rapidly direction beneficial economies, share common vision great prosperity economic well-being region. thank attention. 3/3 ardian fullani: monetary policy challenge framework approximate bank albania european central bank greet speech mr ardian fullani, governor

governor south african reserve bank, year-end medium cocktail function, johannesburg, 14 december 2004. * * * 1. introduction over past decade, south africa establish well-developed bank system compare favourably many develop country set south africa apart many emerge market countries. at end 2004, find mature bank sector, moderate level private-sector indebtedness respectable first-rate regulatory legal framework. south african bank well manage utilise sophisticate risk-management system corporate-governance structure conduct business bank. south africa’s bank regulate accordance

sector currently hold 31 banks, exclude two mutual banks. initially, number medium small local bank increase steadily past decade. during, latter part 1999, however, bank face liquidity pressures, lead many medium small bank exit bank system. this downward trend reach low point placement saambou bank curatorship february 2002 subsequent integration boe bank nedbank. from last quarter 1999 end march 2003, 22 bank exit south african bank system. it said, however, phenomenon due consolidation broad bank sector failure medium small bank sector. currently, small local bank constitute 3.1 per cent total bank sector assets, comparison 21.7 per cent 1994. a result political isolation south africa mid-1980’s, international bank terminate operation south africa. immediately prior advent

time, international bank expand operation south africa. besides add depth sophistication south african market, foreign bank begin tap south african labour market. consequently, arrival predominantly resourceful experience bank pose formidable challenge local banks. in quest survive excel, south african bank devise mean adapt new terrain. a result increase competition, lend margin place great pressure, several bank expand business enter market slightly high credit-risk profiles. currently, major bank offer wide range service individual corporate customers. one-stop relationship banking, emphasis universal banking, instead isolate services, gain importance past years. nevertheless, several banks, especially small local foreign bank continue service niche markets, hold form competitive advantage. 4. trend south african bank past decade generally, south african bank sector remain fairly stable past decade. the first part past decade characterise global financial turbulence bank crisis many countries. in general, south african bank sector show remarkably resilient crisis experienced. the latter part decade characterise significant depreciation south african currency and, 2002, experience bank instability. fortunately, owe particularly solid foundation upon bank system based, 2003 2004 mark great stability. (i) balance-sheet structure the aggregate balance sheet bank south african bank sector grow r344.6 billion end december 1994 r724 billion end december 1999. by end october 2004, total asset grow record high r1.436 trillion. loan advance grow continuously past decade, r270.8 billion end dec 1994 r 1.104 trillion end october 2004. domestic deposit public remain main source fund bank sector past ten year amount r888 billion october 2004 (as oppose r241.9 billion end december 1994). (ii) profitability the efficiency bank sector determine express operate expense percentage total income. currently, international benchmark efficiency 60 per cent. in past, south african bank able keep ratio close international benchmark. the ratio, however, increase 60.2 per cent 1999 67 per cent 2002. the high volatility efficiency 2002 indicate south african bank sector indeed experience problem profitability first six month 2002. this deterioration confirm return equity 5.4 per cent (smoothed 12-months) return asset 0.4 per cent (smoothed 12-months) end june 2002. since 2002, however, efficiency ratio improve and, end october 2004, efficiency bank sector 65.2 per cent. by end october 2004, return equity return asset bank sector similarly improved. (iii) capital adequacy the change focus regulatory authority direct control market-based approach accompany emphasis proper capitalisation, sound risk-management procedure great disclosure. south africa adhere capital-adequacy guideline bank promulgate basel committee bank supervision. the requirement maintain capital equal full ratio 8 per cent risk-weighted asset change rate 10 per cent 2/7 registrar bank 2001. by end october 2004, bank sector whole capital-adequacy ratio 13 per cent (up 9.5 per cent december 1994). (iv) non-performing loan of great significance decrease growth total non-performing loan past decade. after reach peak r29.2 billion march 1999, growth total non-performing loan decline r23.8 billion end december 2003. during 2004, total non-performing loan continue decrease level r20.9 billion. provision bank remain adequate throughout past decade despite non-performing loan high late nineties, mention earlier. 5. reaction regulator small mid-sized bank crisis it common cause south african bank sector experience certain mini-crises past decade. none concern instability experience small mid-sized bank period saambou problem. saambou bank experience liquidity crisis, emanate negative market perceptions, profit-warning announcement sale saambou share two bank’s executive directors. at time, saambou seventh large south african bank large retail deposit base well-established branch network. in order prevent crisis confidence small mid-sized bank sector, saambou place curatorship. unfortunately, lead withdrawals, small bank also large banks. this loss confidence significantly affect sixth large bank time, boe bank, indicate lack confidence could move scale scale. since trend could supported, south african reserve bank enter consultation national treasury, ultimately issue guarantee depositor government would fund withdrawals. this action send signal market authority serious maintain stability bank sector. several lesson learn small mid-sized bank crises. first, owe special nature banks, key players, including, example, external auditors, analysts, medium rat agencies, appreciate nature bank act responsibly deal bank sector. second, regulatory authority must also mindful fact actions, combine separately, constitute signal market great problem may result bank distress handle manner provide certainty. third, regulatory authority also learn treat circumspect institution apply bank licence, interest individual shareholder interest depositor base mind make business decisions. an institution long allow register conduct business bank and, then, simply ride coat tail name “bank”, whilst time conduct deposit-taking business act responsibly interest depositor base, rather interest unobtainable share price. fourth, registrar bank need mindful “boutique” bank fulfil definition “acceptance deposit form general public” and, asset side balance sheet, act “in interest general public”. fifth, result problem prevalent small mid-sized bank sector past decade, especially towards latter part decade, south african reserve bank adopt policy framework deal bank distress. this policy framework serf provide clarity process place deal bank distress, also prevent problem one bank spread banks. it is, however, framework guide approach taken, particular approach decide case-by-case basis, depend specific circumstances. sixth, addition policy framework deal bank distress, registrar bank emphasise importance sound corporate governance banks. in order investigate standard corporate governance within south african bank sector, registrar appoint adv j f myburgh sc conduct review status compliance sound corporate-governance practice within five large bank group south africa 2002. 3/7 among adv myburgh’s find that, generally bank investigate commit adherence application high standard corporate governance; bank initiative review corporate-governance principle time time; corporate governance bank generally sound vigilance require ensure continue compliance best practice corporate governance evolve south africa internationally. myburgh’s recommendation were, inter alia, board bank consist 16 members; bank’s board four executive directors; majority non-executive director independent director immediate effect; bank aim majority director independent director within five years. the registrar bank accept recommendation make adv myburgh dedicate review commitment sound corporate governance bank sector ongoing basis currently review corporate governance remain “non-big five” banks. it need stressed, however, objective regulatory supervisory authority world wide never avoid failure financial participants, and, that, sound system, failures. instead, objective strive optimal balance between, one hand, cost control intervention order address market failure and, hand, anticipate benefit regulation supervision. the need sound relationship proper coordination fiscal authority regulator also overemphasised. 6. emergence “four-pillar” policy the four pillar policy relate minimum number substantial bank (so call “pillars”) domestic bank industry rely discourage merger four banks. the primary reason policy relate maintenance minimum level competition, interest prudential systemic stability, order avoid spread risk promote reliance broad platform institutions. currently, australia rely heavily “four-pillar” policy, originate 1990 previous “six-pillar” policy. new zealand, effectively major bank australia, protect australian policy. the australian “six-pillar” policy discourage merger four major bank two major life insurance companies. the australian government determine would anti-competitive four big bank two big insurance company merge. in 1997, however, australian government scrap “six-pillar” policy wallis inquiry conclude increase competition would achieve low costs, good service high efficiency consumers. nevertheless, australian government determine insufficient competition allow merger among big four bank thus “six-pillar” policy become “four-pillar” policy. accord south african minister finance, responsibility national financial policy, south africa also follow “four-pillar” policy. recently, minister state south africa maintain “four-pillar” policy four big, locally own bank regulate office banks. the “four-pillar” policy south africa lay heart consider nedcor bank bid stanbic. the argument advance conclusion draw time conform principle. current indication number international bank interest acquire one two four pillars. even interest approved, seem important reserve bank still remain four pillar upon bank system rests. the presence internationally-owned bank certainly introduce competition theory benefit consumers. the authority therefore examine application buy one four pillar case case basis. the world change fast regulatory authority cannot see stand way globalisation rapid changes. these change welcome indicative increasingly positive outlook south africa. the authority therefore face task anticipate keep abreast change meet new challenge opportunities. ‘nothing stable except stability’ progress measure ‘constantly change circumstance change’, great philosopher old would say. 4/7 7. current challenge bank policy, especially view international banks’ interest acquire local bank closely relate consideration four-pillar policy country consideration whether international ownership “pillars” permit and, so, conditions. in regard, bank system new zealand serf good example country that, whilst predominantly non-resident own banks, maintain sound financial system decades. should international interest local bank culminate international ownership, supervisory regime would follow internationally agree framework “home-host” bank supervision. this already operation south african-owned bank presence abroad internationally-owned bank presence south africa. the success system rely largely home-country host-country regulator ensure compliance basel core principle effective bank supervision various guideline flow therefrom. in regard, regulator seek ensure requirement obstruct home-country requirement and, consistent meet responsibilities, dovetail much possible requirements. maintenance sound efficient financial system ability respond crisis effectively crucial prerequisite country’s economic social welfare. therefore, host-country supervisory arrangement essential, structure coordinate home host supervision. home-country host-country supervisor able rely support one another times. when bank group international shareholders, important host-country supervisor able rely shareholder reference time need. 8. challenge go forward three important challenge face south african bank system, include bank supervisors, forthcoming number years. these challenge implementation new capital accord, basel ii, accord commonly known; provision broad access bank services; full implementation anti-money launder measures. (i) basel ii the principle basel ii intend align capital-adequacy requirement closely key element bank risk provide bank enhance risk-measurement risk-management capabilities. the revise capital framework furthermore attempt adapt new development instrument neutral towards financial innovation. although aim stifle innovation, framework also intend encourage capital arbitrage. basel ii evidently bring high supervisory compliance burden, accord’s great complexity. the office bank embrace principle contain within basel ii opinion basel ii suitable application g10 non-g10 countries, since provide menu approach suitable sophisticate least sophisticate banks. implementation basel ii one high-priority strategic focus area registrar bank forthcoming number years. basel ii implement within south african bank sector 1 january 2008. parallel run take place 2007. the office bank continue direct resource towards develop supervisory framework involve approach offer new accord. basel ii significant impact banks, also supervisors, re-engineer process tailor organisational structure meet basel ii standards. in collaboration supervisors, office bank currently develop basel ii implementation strategy. this process requires, amongst things, thorough understand provision basel ii, design appropriate supervisory process development complementary tool discharge supervisory duties. ultimately, new capital-adequacy framework potential improve risk management bank align economic capital closely regulatory capital. co-operation bank supervisors, supervisor different 5/7 country different bank therefore essential successful implementation basel ii. the accord implementation forum establish registrar bank represent bank various stakeholder function well assist bank sector regulator identify address risk may arise prior implementation system design ensure compliance basel ii. there continue amendment regulatory framework supervisory process procedures, well development complementary tools, order cater requirement basel ii. (ii) broad access bank facility one topical issue current south african financial landscape need extend access bank facility wide basis currently case. in south africa, regulation provision financial service poor largely base exemption notice bank act. the south african reserve bank announce bank supervision department’s 2002, annual report, envisage amend regulatory framework order allow establishment different class bank institutions, second-tier third-tier banks. draft legislation publish national treasury form dedicate bank bill co-operative bank bill, mean provide access bank sector interest participant thus ensure flow-down bank service wide community. it essential, however, new legislation ensure business institution conduct safe sound manner, conducive orderly growth financial sector, whilst contribute poverty reduction rural urban areas. comment dedicate bank bill co-operative bank bill may provide end january 2005. (iii) anti-money launder the financial intelligence centre act, 2001 (fic act), impose duty certain institution introduce anti-money-laundering measures, train employees, report suspicious transaction financial intelligence centre (fic) retain client information. the bank sector therefore begin concert campaign comply fic act fulfill sector’s obligation term local legislation international guidelines. in may 2002, south africa apply membership financial action task force (fatf), intergovernmental body develop promote policies, nationally internationally, combat money laundering. south africa grant fatf membership june 2003. a february 2003, bank several institution report suspicious transaction may involve money launder fic. bank make detail report unusual and/or suspicious transaction fic. in addition, bank report number report registrar banks. although challenge banks, result additional system resource requirements, bank show commitment comply duties. the bank supervision department obligation monitor compliance bank fic act anti-money launder guidelines. in order ensure compliance requirement fic act, circular issue december 2002. the circular provide guideline type measure bank implement order prevent use launder proceed crime. in term circular, bank furnish bank supervision department detail plan, time frame bank intend achieve full implementation compliance fic act fic regulations. the initial deadline 30 june 2004 bank verify identity 17 million client extend range new deadlines, start 31 october 2004 high-risk client end 30

december 2004. * * * it task swiss national bank (snb) contribute stability financial system. implementation rest three pillars: macroprudential oversight bank sector (financial stability report), oversight systemically important payment security settlement system (system oversight) crisis management measures. this i talk last press conference. today, i would like give look behind scene system oversight. then i turn regulatory environment, also oblige critically monitor shape. system oversight: look behind scene in last months, define payment security settlement system systemically important. only system comply minimum requirement stipulate national bank ordinance. to class systemically important, sufficient system significant national economy, ie merely consider number volume transaction settle system. rather, focus whether failure system jeopardise economy’s supply liquidity. this case particularly participant flaw payment security settlement system alternatives. the few alternative available, serious liquidity bottleneck counterparty risks. an additional aspect relate network. it come play system connect link systems, case central counterparty si x-clear, link trade platform virt-x security settlement system secom. the failure connect link significantly affect operation upstream downstream systems, even link minor direct relevance market participants. our analysis lead conclusion follow system classify systemically important: interbank payment system swiss interbank clear (sic), security settlement system secom, central counterparty si x-clear multi-currency payment system continuous link settlement (cls). postfinance class systemically important. this may surprise give economic significance postal payment transactions, direct result existence alternatives, ie bank payment transactions, instantly available postal payment system experience serious problems. of systemically important systems, cl exempt minimum requirement already adequately oversee federal reserve bank new york exchange information new york feed national bank run smoothly. by strictly avoid duplications, reduce burden oversight, ie density regulation, also case secom si x-clear. the operator system supervise bank swiss federal bank commission (sfbc). cooperation sfbc snb facilitate provision bank act requirement stipulate national bank ordinance partly similar, authority wish minimise regulatory burden. this also interest system subject oversight. i add sfbc, evaluate system opportunity comment classification. the classification finalise begin next year. basel ii: never-ending story? the national bank involve implementation recommendation international convergence capital measurement capital standards, know basel ii. the national bank provide member serve basel committee bank supervision. a authority commit system stability, also share responsibility adequately implement committee’s recommendations. the sfbc’s fundamental hypothesis undisputed, namely current provision need reform recommendation basel committee implement 1/2 moderation, time dilution capital adequacy requirement aim reduce insolvency risk avoided. we confident party directly involved, ie sfbc banks, succeed agreeing, within give time frame, pragmatic acceptable solutions. with view future, i note current reform increase complexity capital adequacy requirements. although potential capital adequacy regulation yet exhausted, possibility also investigate future. complement capital adequacy approach improve liquidity management bank seem particularly promise measure. shortcoming liquidity management may give rise problem cannot resolve adequate capitalisation. it surprise consideration make primarily central banks. after all, liquidity concern typical central banks. on macro level, maintain supply liquidity monetary policy task. on micro level, however, task bank bring solvency line risks. this require liquidity risk correctly assess managed, assets, necessary use collateral, make available. the central bank supervisory authority g-10 country should, therefore, increasingly focus attention minimise liquidity risks. this particular relevance bank systemically important internationally active. integrate financial market oversight: now? in meantime, federal council decide procedure regard federal act financial market oversight (finma act). the federal department finance prepare statement end next year submit federal council. the statement shall comprise first two part report zimmerli expert commission (on creation integrate financial market oversight sanctions). the third part project (examination expand prudential oversight) deal late point time. the federal council take various concern national bank account. a regard division task supervisory board management board particular, federal council move close view hold national bank, belief important power disposition remain management board. a non-professional body, supervisory board inevitably face conflict interest, could prove obstacle individual dispositions. however, experience know-how supervisory board fully exploit regard deliberation question principle, budget important staff issues. furthermore, support increase budgetary autonomy federal financial market oversight authority (finma), convince financial centre complex significant swiss financial centre require authority supervisory management board whose power equal correspond body bank insurance companies. the national bank back project regard finma act. we continue view integration financial market oversight mean improve oversight rather end itself. should emerge course work - either regard sanction prudential oversight - plan reform become cumbersome jeopardise present level bank supervision, reserve right reassess project. conclusion my explanation clearly reflect national bank’s wish adopt moderate stance regard public interventions. we please federal council request finma act regulation consequence new project assessed. the ongoing reform capital adequacy requirement drive international standard (basel ii). it responsibility sfbc bank find correct acceptable solutions. everything beyond must prepare g-10 bodies. the call moderation directly affect national bank regard oversight payment security settlement systems. we contribute minimise regulatory burden interpret term “systemically important” line law, closely cooperate sfbc take account activity foreign oversight authorities. we continue path future, too. 2/2 jens thomsen: brief overview danish economy statement mr jens thomsen, member board governor national bank denmark, meet danish economic council, copenhagen, 30 november 2004. * * * the cyclical analysis chairmanship danish economic council line analyses: danish economy upswing, drive strong growth domestic demand. this contribute bring unemployment raise labour force participation. the late national account figure indicate growth slow down, figure often revise significantly thus uncertain. it go without say prerequisite danish economic development international cyclical scenario weaken markedly. danmark nationalbank agree chairmanship fiscal relaxation required. fiscal policy must formulate medium term, base 2010 plan. short-term fiscal adjustment tend unwanted effects. obviously, structural measure must take keep surplus public finance 1½-2½ per cent gdp. here, report point lack new employment-policy initiative give cause concern. chapter 1.4’s discussion wage competitiveness scarcely touch issue productivity development. how danish wage rise fast competitor number year effective krone rate risen, employment level high, recently begin rise again, enjoy sound (and rising) surplus current account? this combination worthy comments, include issue productivity growth, even obvious cause effect. a far excise duty concerned, emphasise highly sensitive cross-border trading. therefore, change relative price may great consequences. the apply duty pesticides. a ban pesticide would effective accompany similar ban neighbour countries. the proposal introduce tax allowance maintenance repair one’s home seem conflict effort expand tax base reduce tax rates. the view advance stability growth pact pertinent. clearly, task increase incentive consolidate good time order avoid ease fiscal policy see germany france 2001 2002. introduction exception certain expenses, investments, add already significant technical calculation problems. moreover, investment equally appropriate strengthen future potential growth. while proposal tradable deficit permit interesting, may difficult put operation. 1/1 zdeněk tůma: education czech republic - case miss generation speech mr zdeněk tůma, governor czech national bank, occasion graduation emba programme cmc graduation school business, prague, 4 december 2004. * * * in recent year i hear many strong statement knowledge base economy. today’s graduation obviously excellent opportunity yet another speech issue i fear would general therefore “empty”. instead, i would like contribute personal experience observations. we almost forget 15 year ago czech slovak educate modern economics business. economic program focus central plan marxist theory socialism 1990. nobody - one exception - allow study abroad since 1960s. when friend martin kupka return geneva 1989 studies, bring textbook macroeconomics dornbusch fischer. he tell me: “we translate czech”. at time, another group work translation “economics” paul samuelson. late on, translate textbook corporate finance brealey myers. in words, start scratch. it two - though interrelate - aspects. first, limit knowledge economics business program look like. and second, people well-founded experience run lecture programs. there generation problem - one generation - still - missing. where stand today cop drawbacks? there magic solution i dare say today almost overcome problem miss generation economic education close gap u develop world fast. i see three important factor contribute development. on first place i would put new generation young strongly motivate people. they create enormous pressure - limit know-how - start prepare new economic courses. this second point respect learning-by-doing process create new courses, mostly design along recent trend economics business education. despite fact experience courses, roughly know direction go. last least, czech education system receive strong support abroad, term visit lecturer money. in cases, two aspect interconnected, completely new program gradually build up. among all, let name center economic research graduate education, u business school prague cmc graduate school business. i offer another illustration far gone. i czech national bank six years. but academician i contact central bank already begin 1990s. at time, staff struggle basic issues: new statistic data newly bear market economy, way economy analyse kind theory model apply etc. the czech national bank receive lot help foreign central bank international institutions. today, level state-of-art receive provide foreign technical assistance. we assist directly number country well expert invite imf mission around world. and yet staff base primarily people educate czech republic. i consider good signal reach significant achievement economic education problem miss generation soon cease exist. i hope continue process catch cmc keep contribute it. what i wish personally? let recall recent visit bank israel occasion 50th anniversary. we lunch finance minister benjamin netanyahu discuss necessary fiscal reforms. mr. netanyahu say push reform through, one need three things: vision, political power. i add combine ingredient - vision, power knowledge - form leader, regardless whether talk politics, managements, science. have mind education network gain 1/2 emba course best assumption succeed. i wish best professional carriers. 2/2 david dodge: financial system efficiency - canadian imperative remark mr david dodge, governor bank canada, empire club canada canadian club toronto, toronto, 9 december 2004. * * * good afternoon. it privilege address joint meet empire canadian clubs, i thank opportunity so. i particularly please speak today bite red-letter day bank canada’s calendar. today, release late edition semi-annual financial system review (fsr). this publication, couple year old, examine issue relate canada’s financial system. each edition fsr take look recent development trend financial system, well issue impact efficiency, safety, soundness. this overall role bank financial system area promote safety, soundness, efficiency. today’s edition contain number article focus promotion financial system efficiency stability. and issue financial system efficiency i talk today. i begin brief discussion bank canada contribute efficiency financial system macroeconomic level. then, i spend time discuss improve efficiency canadian financial institution markets; is, microeconomic aspect efficiency. but i that, i start define i mean “financial system” “efficiency.” then, i explain critically important canada improve area. when i talk “financial system,” i refer financial institution markets, infrastructure, laws, regulation govern support operations, macroeconomic framework within operate. my message improve efficiency canada’s financial system imperative. but efficient financial system? in economic terms, efficient financial system one help allocate scarce economic resource productive uses, cost-effective way. the ultimate goal canada’s financial institution market match investor save appropriate, productive investments. put directly, canadian want sustainable economic growth prosperity, financial system must function efficiently possible. let explain efficiency important. with efficient system, investor get high risk-adjusted return investment borrower minimize cost raise capital. inefficiency drive wedge borrower pay investor receive. i’ll give example inefficiency interfere save investment process crucial economic growth. if adequate information isn’t available, potential investor can’t tell whether particular investment fit tolerance risk. if finance cost high inefficiencies, borrower won’t able secure fund need expand. if competition isn’t encouraged, various player financial system won’t right incentive innovate. this it’s critical financial system work efficiently. efficiency bank canada i would like spend minute bank canada’s role promote efficient financial system. in order system, need supportive framework macroeconomic policy minimize uncertainty enhance confidence future value money. this include prudent fiscal policies, responsibility minister finance. it also include effective monetary policy, bank canada’s responsibility. we achieve effective monetary policy system inflation targeting. one key benefit regime inflation expectation become well anchor 2 per cent target, short term, also long term. a result, borrower pay much small 1/4 premium compensate investor inflation risk. this particularly important long end yield curve. reduce uncertainty lead low cost borrower efficient allocation resources. the promotion safe sound financial system reduce uncertainty systemic risk also contribute efficiency. we work partnership federal provincial agencies, regulators, market participant area, order actively foster safety soundness financial system. we also number unique responsibilities. it role, example, oversee payment, clearing, settlement system could pose systemic risk. these system design provide certainty large-value payment security transaction settle real time. in addition, design operate use relatively small amount liquidity compare system countries. this free resource put productive use elsewhere. the bank canada also “lender last resort” - ultimate provider liquidity financial system. indeed, we’ve conclude review role, detail find fsr release today. there also international element efforts. the bank canada work partner country initiative strengthen international financial system. the goal minimize risk financial crisis one part world spread across borders. but that’s topic whole speech. so summarize, canada’s macroeconomic prudential policy generally job suppose support efficiency. but let clear - complacent; always look way improve. continuous improvement essential. efficiency financial institution market now, i want talk specifically microeconomic aspect efficiency financial institution markets, include promotion competition provision appropriate legal regulatory framework. competition drive innovation efficiency gains. and appropriate legal regulatory framework give investor fair access necessary information, minimize cost raise capital. the evidence show canada’s financial institution market generally efficient compare countries. but past decade, market financial institution elsewhere become - become - efficient. to stay competitive environment, canada’s financial system must also constantly increase efficiency. if don’t make effort, canadian economy suffer. the status quo won’t cut it. so priority be? i’ll talk financial institution first financial markets. efficiency financial institution in term financial institutions, quick look backward may show u way forward. i want go back 40 years, 1964, recall royal commission bank finance, otherwise know porter commission. the porter commission well ahead time, groundbreaking analysis policy recommendations. in post-world war ii environment, extensive government control economy still think desirable, porter come strongly favour great competition, free markets, effective regulation serve enhance efficiency. in wake porter commission, canada revise financial legislation crucial ways. canadian bank respond new competitive environment innovate enhance efficiency. canadian institution become world leaders, financial institution many country still operate restrictive less-efficient regulatory regimes. over next three decades, canada continue lead world. successive revision legislation cover financial institution encourage great cross-pillar competition areas, lead low cost improve efficiency. but past decade, country catch forge ahead. during time, two trend change global environment financial institutions. first, expansion world trade, national market become truly global. financial institution find way provide enhance service customer worldwide. second, country - particularly unite state unite kingdom - begin align regulatory framework 2/4 competitive philosophy porter commission. the regulatory barrier hold back competition, geographically among different type institutions, begin fall rapidly. out open competitive environment come consolidation - among institution across pillar jurisdictions. a result, foreign institution good place exploit new technology order enhance efficiency, offer new instrument combination service clients. these two trend lead great benefit consumer worldwide, continuing. in circumstances, canada face difficult policy challenge. how enhance policy framework provide great incentive innovation encourage competition while, time, give institution scope improve efficiency? this challenge canadian consider mergers, within across pillars, removal barrier foreign competition. the question best way enhance competition - balance incentive efficiency legitimate public policy concern - complex. and i don’t simple answers. but efficiency must heart debate. because, end, efficient financial system key future - institutions, canadian economy whole. financial market efficiency let turn financial markets. when come competitiveness global financial markets, size, depth, liquidity matter. so canadian financial market - whether equity, fixed-income, derivatives, foreign-exchange - inherent disadvantage compare new york london. to compensate, canadian financial market relatively even efficient. so canada improve efficiency markets? one area receive lot attention, canada many countries, security regulation. the key issue reduce economist call “information asymmetries” much practical. what mean regulatory framework aim - general - market price reflect relevant information, party transaction fair access information. we enhance efficiency reduce information asymmetry point cost additional compliance would outweigh benefits. follow event enron, parmalat, livent, become clear investor always receive sufficient accurate information. corporate scandal prompt many investor say: “there oughta law!” - law make publicly trade company disclose information. but rush write law regulations, much attention pay detail rule govern company disclose information, rather focus disclose. we see large increase cost provide information - particularly unite state - without commensurate progress towards improve relevance information disclosed. the concept relevant disclosure particularly important country like canada, public company range size small large multinational. the precise nature constitute relevant information differ depend size complexity firm. corporate disclosure regulation recognize this. for large, complex firms, complex rule require order investor receive appropriate information. but small firms, less-complex disclosure regulation - low cost compliance - may result best cost-benefit balance. the canadian security administrator recognize point put forward new proposal guideline corporate governance base firm’s size. there another consideration, need company access global capital markets. firm want list international exchange follow disclosure rule apply markets. and large canadian firm want raise capital abroad need regulation recognize meet international standards. but smaller, less-complex firm - make vast majority publicly list company canada - may want raise capital abroad. so may make sense canadian regulator force small firm comply kind detail rule would appropriate large firms. let clear. the principle heart canada’s regulatory framework must good as, good than, country. but keep mind company consider mid-sized term capitalization canada would regard micro-capitalized international standards. historically, canada’s public market do well fund small company 3/4 efficiently. this continue future. so clear regulatory framework take account differ level size complexity establish rule disclosure. the rule require ceo sign-off financial statement case point. the principle behind rule try make sure investor sufficient accurate information. hold ceo accountable good way go this. the principle work equally well large small firms. but need careful. for large complex organizations, set detail rule term procedure may helpful. however, need whole raft complex rule tell ceo small firm procedure must follow put signature financial statements. we need careful write rule govern input come ceo sign-off. rather, need focus get output right, document ceo sign actually give investor sufficient accurate information. efficiency dictate canada uniform security law regulations, base principle apply everyone. some take idea advocate single, pan-canadian security regulator. i’m today weigh debate. but i want stress that, whatever structure regulator, must strive efficiency regulation - best regulation, low cost. now let talk briefly another important information issue, issue price transparency markets. here, i refer timely, public disclosure transaction details, price volume. it difficult see information lead good resource allocation. the appropriate level transparency may vary market market. generally, liquid market, high level transparency support. however, world move great transparency market spread technology. the bank canada conduct research work market participant regulator way increase transparency canadian markets, due regard liquidity, equitable access, fair play. together price transparency, ingredient help create efficient, well-functioning markets. it important get transparency regulation right. but also need devote appropriate time effort make whatever rule write, include exist ones. this mean focus range small initiative enhance efficiency. for example, provincial territorial legislature need make uniform security transfer act priority. such act would provide sound legal basis hold transfer right security hold book-entry form, would replace current patchwork legal rule area. another initiative canadian capital market association’s focus trade-matching support progress towards straight-through processing. there’s one area absolutely critical canada continue improve, enforcement. there widely hold perception canadian authority aren’t tough enough punish fraud enforce insider-trading rules. that’s encourage see step toughen enforcement taken, provincial security commissions, investment dealer association, law-enforcement agencies, federal government. these kind step improve enforcement must continue. conclusion let conclude. to improve economic financial welfare canadians, need efficient financial system. the bank canada contribute goal enhance canadians’ confidence value money reduce risk safety stability financial system. our financial system review part effort. but effort must extend far beyond central bank. i’ve raise issue today i think critical enhance efficiency financial system. none issue new. they study analyze thoroughly. but canada study analyzing, rest world acting. it’s time u act, too. we get job improve efficiency. the future health economy prosperity canadian depend it. 4/4 panayotis thomopoulos: post-olympic greece 2004 - infrastructural development financial innovation speech mr panayotis thomopoulos, deputy governor bank greece, euromoney conferences, athens, 24 november 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it rare opportunity able address distinguish audience one topical issue future greece post-olympics era. in everyone’s mind question whether greece sustain relatively high level growth achieve recent year demand stimulus come preparation olympics come end. this important change greece indeed, come top difficulty face world economy oil shock, geopolitical uncertainty threat disorderly resolution global imbalances. try forecast future always perilous activity today’s circumstance one might incline take pessimistic view. i would like diverge pessimist i use time explain greece continue path strong growth address forthcoming challenge adopt sound market-friendly policies. to use sport metaphor, 1960s 1970s greece european gold medal fast gdp growth, afterwards successive coach failed, since 1994 come discipline excellent coach, german inspire maastricht treaty finally 2004 european champion football cup (euro). indeed, greece’s annual rate gdp growth 3.7% 1997 2004 second high eu, ireland, one-half big euro area. i believe retain position near top put best effort it. year 2005 difficult one, necessary fiscal adjustment high oil price constrain growth. however, medium-term, i see danger severe slowdown recession. of course, cannot continue grow extend period rate 4%, deceleration expect may u good help contain inflationary pressures. our growth rate may regress back long-term potential, i estimate around 3½%. i want note oecd medium-term scenario recently reach broad conclusion - estimate average growth rate 3½% per annum end decade, 1?% percentage point high scenario present euro area whole. of course, international economic environment improves, especially eu growth turn much high 2% greece also reach high growth path. on demand side, private consumption investment continue strong. the continuation community support programmes, though decline trend, help support public private investment quite years. the go investment infrastructure, especially peripheral regions, continue underpin fast rate productivity growth, olympics 2004-related investment do athens area. businessmen ordinary citizen last appreciate fruit endeavour forget discomfort cause various work head completion, i sure many visitor today benefit renovate athens area. the list project underway planned, eg egnatia highway, highway link northern neighbour beyond, essential provide necessary complement private investment, business investment also respond announce tax relief. despite fear contrary, i see danger private consumption. private indebtedness indeed increase fast level still quite low european standards. compare increase private wealth greek households, reflect rise asset price house stock, net private indebtedness increase much. recently, start see gentle deceleration credit growth, which, i believe, sign responsible behavior borrower banks. despite horror story newspapers, far position indebtedness would threaten growth. a long growth remain robust, household see reason cut back consumption habit drastically, although temporary minor adjustment cannot rule out. indeed, phase disinflation, one expect next couple year aim narrow inflation differential vis-a-vis euro area, small adjustment consumption trend may take place. bi review 74/2004 1 the external sector able assume prominent role. after couple disappoint years, already indication tourism pick up, help positive image greece project olympics assist improvement transport infrastructure upgrade hotel tourist resort general. moreover, price fever associate olympics seem subside hotelier appear scale price competitive levels, book 2005 rise. in general, tourism remain buoyant source growth greek economy, especially government decide allow shop stay open week-afternoons extend open hour archaeological site museum late afternoon make city centre attractive. the authority make cost/benefit analysis order ass significant overall economic gain could derive if, rest civilise world, museum archaeological site open also afternoons. ship go upswing, relate balance payment receipt probably reach record €12 billion 2004, exceed wide margin travel receipts, immediate prospect ship remain favourable. however, note although ship may year become large net export earner, multiplier effect rest economy small tourism. and employ 80% few people tourism and, owe high revenue per caput shipping, save rate much high correspondingly le spend home products. the emerge upturn europe also help export good services. on supply side, huge investment recent year start bear fruit, forget contribution immigrant supply demand. immigrant become essential part production system, - i would also add - society, while, time, become unique economic political link neighbour countries, originate. they undoubtedly help integration balkan country contribute economic development wide region. much say fact greece laggard implement lisbon strategy. this partially true, look side, much still achieve embark implementation lisbon agenda. this priority policy makers. liberalise labor product market bring benefit even short-run. allow great labor flexibility induce entrepreneur and, especially, foreign investor enter market. remove oligopolistic practice spur growth help contain prices. flexibility labour market mean le protection protection workers. the strict labour laws, are, sometimes, unfortunately, interpret even strict judges, important factor behind big underground economy. unregistered labour job protection also le well pay register workers. the insider/outsider issue, reach big proportion greece, also important factor behind record high unemployment rate, especially affect young people. the relatively small proportion register worker also undermine capacity pension system pay future full pension entitlement to-days work population. accordingly, insider may even well end day think. more flexible labour law bring surface unregistered labour concomitant increase social security contribution also help establish sound pension system deliver commitments. accordingly, authority move right direction also benefit reform dividend. one thing clear future different past. growth recent year base domestic demand, fuel construction, overall easy monetary condition large deficits, recorded. these favourable factor play small role future, fiscal position move gradually balance surplus real interest rate increase, reflect decline inflation rise nominal interest rate, ecb change monetary policy stance. so give prominence external source growth structural measures. we must adopt “extrovert” policy give priority improve role world economy. sometimes i hear argument import substitution source growth. let u frank; small, country-based economy, greek one, firm also export critical mass production remain viable highly competitive global economy. it good delete import-substitution greek vocabulary. in reshape economy, focus area already enjoy comparative advantage, i mainly service mind. this mean neglect agriculture industry. i simply want say two sector cease pillar growth. 2 bi review 74/2004 the greek agricultural sector follow international trend shrink le 7% gdp, probably decline close european average. manufacturing’s share gdp stagnate may follow slow downward trend. we fool trend reversed, try engage intervention distort market incentives. in particular, ongoing reform common agricultural policy final liberalisation textile trade next year put pressure sectors. greek farmer entrepreneur certainly improve quality product move high value-added product lines. they use window opportunity offer unusually low interest rate embark necessary investments. but clear greece advance economy, high per caput income international standards, cannot expect remain competitive labour-intensive low value-added industries. the high productivity growth recent past transform greek economy also bring along new challenges. in recent study oecd 10-year period 2003, 30 oecd countries, greece rank fifth, ireland, korea, luxembourg czech republic, productivity growth table, 2.8% annual rate increase labour productivity, 40% fast oecd average. we invest quality develop distinctive image greek products. we also exploit geographic location traditional orientation trade toward country south-eastern europe middle east. we long complain difficult geopolitical position, reflect condition neighbors, enjoy neighbor south-east europe middle east become market economy grow fast. our industry quick seize opportunity re-oriented greek export toward region, whose share greek export rise le 15% early 1990s 25% last year. i amaze see bulgaria fourth big customer, turkey move sixth place. greece occupy advantageous geographical position; especially northern greece port thessaloniki bind become indispensable transit link trade travel balkan countries. fyrom sea outlet, thessaloniki also close sofia bulgarian port black sea, apply large region south-east romania, south serbia etc. company establish region find convenient use thessaloniki trade port sea outlets. especially, one take account queue time need cross bosphorus, economic advantage greek port evident. this even eu co-financed trans-european transport networks, open aegean port northern neighbour beyond, reach maturity phase towards end decade. can thessaloniki become rotterdam balkans? keep proportion i would reply yes, expansion recent year especially 2007 road link turkey west (the egnatia highway) finish guarantee thessaloniki along northern greece restore past trade economic glory, say nothing fact pleasant, many respect athens, city live in. greece special position export service far exceed export goods. in fact, non-oil good export somewhat le tourism receipt even le shipping, total receipt service cover four-fifths total non-energy good imports. many foreign observer indicate, source concern, greece’s trade imbalance forget -in world live in- service grow faster. we build success areas. it well know greece major world power ship far important ship nation european union and, basis new orders, may increase even world market share medium term. for economic geopolitical reasons, europe need strong merchant fleet, lie greece’s important contribution union. greece, ship tradition three thousand years, maintain comparative strength area benefit european union’s whole. ship sector subject practically unhindered international competition; is, therefore, necessary impose measure regulation could impair competitiveness, apart require environmental reasons. we also look way enhance role piraeus international ship center. from previous remarks, become clear greece play significant role bridge industrial country europe one hand south east-europe middle east other. we aim attract direct investment foreigners, use greece regional headquarter high-end activities, labor-intensive bi review 74/2004 3 phase production locate neighbour country abundant labor supply. greece well place role. our labor force well educated, significant part work knowledge foreign language. both quality life infrastructure improve enormously last years, especially athens region result major work undertake olympics, now, government announced, attention direct thessaloniki. undoubtedly, many country region, notably turkey, may aspire i think edge. greece open society, accustom work within international environment. indeed, many greek spend year abroad work studying, asset country. many also tie country south east europe former soviet union, well middle east country live whose language business environment know. don’t forget long ago 300,000 greek live egypt. the important advantage often cite relate greece’s membership eu nearly quarter century. greece offers: 1. legal certainty, rule law apply similar industrialise eu countries; 2. macroeconomic stability strong currency euro area member; 3. friendly business environment; 4. resilient economy society prove worth normal condition also turbulent economic period (e.g. oil shocks, speculative attack drachma, abrupt rise decline stock exchange would force many economy bend knees). 5. sound bank system, extend network balkan countries. bank oil mechanism capitalist system oil good quality sooner late engine come stop. turkey’s bank crisis relate foreign exchange crisis year ago reminder. from early 1990s bank greece, supervisory authority, lay rule bring pressure bear modernization strengthen bank sector. to-day coordinate effort commercial bank promote necessary adjustment line basel ii. the new international report financial standard account standards, make bank system even flexible, strengthen capital base improve internal control risk management systems. give also significant presence greek bank balkan country bank greece sign memoranda understand cooperation supervisory authority countries. greek firm also rise task respond globalisation adopt defensive strategy, embrace globalisation themselves. there significant direct investment greek firm abroad, especially balkans. this particularly evident financial sector, greek bank occupy top position neighbor countries. about 5,000 greek firms, mostly small medium-size enterprise also large ones, operate balkan country greece three big investor region. this inevitably entail delocalisation part greece’s manufacture trade units. however, long retain greece high value add activity (their headquarters, commercial research activity etc), delocalisation long run help host home country economy. i always try give example: the uk lose 3.5 million industrial job (50% decrease) 1978

repeatedly stress example london financial center, factor favour athens become regional financial center, balkan even country away. likewise, athens thessaloniki become trade center company operate wide area. attract foreign firm form central part future strategy. in foreign direct investment league, especially manufacturing, greece unfortunately come close bottom europe. but hide fact many foreign firms, either completely alliance greek firms, operate greece, usually trademark original greek owner, even die long ago. this special partnership develop further, side complement 4 bi review 74/2004 cross border alliance essential support growth, especially case small countries. though, i said, even greece’s performance area foreign direct investment quite disappointing, i believe thing change. after many year sustain effort new, pro-business mentality, evidence wide political consensus need promote market-friendly reform recent low corporate taxation right direction. above all, need reduce bureaucracy combat decisively case improper practices. on latter issue, adopt policy “zero tolerance.” we establish clear simple rule conduct business, amenable interference politician public servants. the “rules game” transparent all. in recent oecd study business sector, greece, though bad performer, unfortunately rank among country bureaucratic impediments: large number license certificate require different authority order open new business also even operate years, big delay issue them, lengthy judicial procedures, retroactive tax controls, sometimes go back 10 year etc. i believe that, authority tackle efficient pro-business manner problem simplify system, big obstacle success overcome. to end, authority weigh suppose political cost, since medium-term political cost inertia much greater. even mistake inevitably make try change long establish practices, reform always pay medium long run. i don’t underestimate cost, since reform meet resistance well-organised body every interest perpetuate anomalies. against resistance, expect benefit reform militant organized, since represent broad spectrum people low benefit per person. besides, benefit reform always

caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, 2nd green accord medium forum, rapolano, italy, 3 november 2004. the reference speech find bank zambia’s website. * * * 1. introduction the world community face unprecedented ecological challenge twenty-first century. many political business leader embrace idea sustainable development, call economic growth without destroy natural environment deplete natural resource future generation depend. yet concept remain controversial, implementation difficult. the task policy maker corporate leader find way meet economic environmental goal come decade, without sacrifice either (post-lawrence-weber, 1999). in africa, environmental issue also frequently sideline policy makers’ agenda due insurmountable economic social problem continent continue face. notwithstanding economic social hardships, africa constantly strive towards attain economic development, environmental sustainability remain key area concern (unep, 2003) although usually remote economic policy makers. in addition, environmental sustainability hardly see many africa underlie factor economic development yet critical that, adequately promptly addressed, positive secondary effect crucial area pertain economic development people’s welfare. in paper, i attempt examine interrelationship environmental growth sustainable economic growth african perspective. the paper organise follows; section 2 examine current economic disposition africa, attempt determine relationship environmental developments. prominence give component affect environmental sustainability, namely (i) pollution (ii) degradation. the latter prove present relatively high risk environmental sustainability africa. section 3 present analysis effect environment economic growth, economic growth environment. section 4 tackle issue africa world economy environmental prospects. section 5 provide current solution aim mitigate and/ reduce various negative externality relate environmental pollution degradation national, regional, international environmental management policies. recommendation consider necessary foster environmental friendly economic development also give input improvement environmental management africa. 2. economic disposition africa with estimate total population 835,479 thousand people represent 13% world’s estimate 6,395, 557 thousand people,1 span 53 country africa, continent face numerous challenge predominantly economic, social, political fronts. despite difficulties, africa record growth rate 3.6% 2003, increase 2.7% record 2002. the increase trend economic growth expect continue 2004 [african development bank (afdb), 2003]. yet challenge remain meet target set millennium development goal (mdgs) aim reduce number world’s poor half year 2015. unfortunately, improvement economic indicator may sufficient enough enable majority african country meet mdgs targets.2 specifically, single digit economic growth rate sufficient tackle widespread poverty continent. accord african development bank, algeria, egypt, libya, morocco, tunisia, mauritius attain specify targets. the majority population africa locate rural area agriculture dependence natural resource remain predominant mean livelihood [united nation 1 a 10/22/2004, source: encyclopedia britannica book year 2004. 2 unite nation environment program (unep) fact sheet, global environment outlook – 3, africa, geo 3, nairobi, kenya, 2003. bi review 74/2004 1 development programme (undp), 2003]. soil, grasslands, freshwater sources, ocean play critical role sustain crop cultivation, graze land livestock, fisheries. the energy sector equally play important role african economy due dependence national economy oil production activities. on one hand, significant dependence oil export country angola, chad, equatorial guinea, nigeria libya become increasingly pronounced. consequently, rise oil price contribute towards augment revenue oil-producing nations, hand threaten revenue nation use produce oil. in spite energy obtain largely hydro geothermal solar source africa, population continue lag behind rest develop world term access electricity. approximately 77.5% sub-saharan population access electricity, majority population rely biomass (dung firewood) domestic energy need (oecd/ adb, 2003). to large extent, economic growth africa still largely drive production raw material hardly subject meaningful industrial processing. this source economic growth direct dependence use natural resource mainly agriculture mining. the lack value-adding process largely underpin historical low level economic growth. 3. effect environmental growth african economic growth 3.1 environmental issue african economic growth environmental issue ought important area concern leader policy makers, make policy decision human development economic welfare, especially develop world. many growth sector effect directly indirectly relate environment. a study jha whalley (1999) argue main environmental issue generally affect develop world degradation, oppose common belief pollution principal factor environmental decay predominantly applicable industrialise countries. degradation comprise follow key areas; soil erosion, decline soil quality due pesticide residue, exploitation open access resource due ill-defined property rights, congestion traffic. other perverse form degradation deforestation desertification. while africa continue suffer economic stagnation, factor result environmental degradation continually increase. some factors, burn fossil fuel release carbon dioxide, possible cause global warming, although less extent compare emission greenhouse gas industrial activities. specifically, predominant way factor affect ecosystem follows; soil erosion involve wash away tract land due mainly human activities. such activities, provide source livelihood many, safeguard preserve land long-term use. typical activity include clear land crop grow animal grazing. relate soil erosion decline soil quality due pesticide residue. this turn lead clear virgin land fertility reduce exist land. exploitation open access resource due ill-defined property right present environmental management africa tremendous challenges. most natural resource africa tend view common good entire population. a consequence open access especially land commonly refer traditional system land tenure. it rampant clear tract land go unrestricted hence result degradation. in urban areas, ill define land ownership responsible mushroom shanty compounds, illegal dump waste, etc. congestion traffic relate population growth rate urbanisation. in africa, modern economic activity concentrate urban centres. these tend export enclave support african economies. with obvious economic tendency population gravitate towards point maximise economic welfare, urban area find face congestion, turn overstretch utility service facility result poor sanitation rampant epidemic respiratory diseases, cholera, etc. in addition, general increase 2 bi review 74/2004 population imply increase pressure natural resource also carbon dioxide release human respiratory process. deforestation currently serious concern africa, forest lose annual rate 5 million hectare (united nation environmental programme [unep], 2003). the grow demography africa result clear land order accommodate house area cultivation due significant dependence majority population agriculture. accord unep 2003, 60% tropical forest area clear africa whole 1990 2000 convert permanent agricultural smallholdings. the cut replace tree contribute global warming. bad still burn forest clear land graze agriculture also release carbon dioxide. desertification another area concern continent. over 45% africa affect desertification, 55% high-to-very-high risk erosion (unep 2003). desertification compound major environmental concern deforestation. in fact, study show mortality rate, maternal health, girl child education region directly link environmental change deforestation. in rural areas, household rely female fetch firewood, therefore, continue deforestation imply long walk distance woman girls. these result complication pregnancy, ailments, well le time girl school work. study also show woman girl africa spend average three hour day fetch water, hence expend third daily intake food (undp 2003). although 26% oil produce africa use locally 2003, energy consumption increase 44% northern african country (adb unep, 2003). however energy consumption liquid fuel come cost. the carbon dioxide (co2) pollution result energy consumption africa approximately 3.5% global emission co2, (unep, 2003). growth demand fish sector ultimately result threat sustainability particular coastal marine populations. to-date per caput fish catch worldwide remain static since 1972, however, measure southern africa decline significantly (unep 2003). globalisation result specialisation economy area comparative advantage. the prevalence cheap labour cost lead african country primarily move towards role produce good labour intensive sector agriculture mining. the demand cash crop export african country develop world equally soared. however use pesticide cash crop production order maintain certain international standard potential reduce soil quality due toxic residue build up. future population growth, expansion agricultural sector, general economic expansion africa see heighten competition water resource among sectors. competition water resource households, industry, agriculture expect increase future, currently 25% population live area already face severe water stress (unep, 2003). although africa’s export global level small 2%, concentration export extraction sector cause concern environment. it mean africa integrate global economy consequence extraction activity environment become pronounced, unless mitigate measure taken. in addition, multinational business quickly realise existence le strenuous environmental standard african countries, desperately seek foreign direct investment (fdi). a result, business rush invest economy realise profit may never available attend possible redress negative effect business activity leave environment. in respect, african policy maker stakeholder pursue economic growth, important appreciate benefit present natural ecosystem diverse form wildlife species. despite economic benefit construct roads, mine areas, farm blocks, exist real threat destruction large area natural habitats. the emergence industry effect urbanisation africa, largely contribute towards increase air pollution many town cities. the incidence smog respiratory disease area increase (unep, 2003), set continue trend foreseeable future. africa contribute significantly emission pollutant arise mainly combustion complex chemical process industries. this low industrialisation characteristic continent, whose economy still trap shackle economic stagnation. sadly bi review 74/2004 3 rate, industrialise nation emit especially greenhouse gases, imply africa also soon begin experience effect global warming. the effect global warming, include floods, hurricane general weather change also affect agriculture production, prospect damage material wealth property negate little gain african economy attain thus far. to complicate situation further, majority african economy buff resource enable rebuild infrastructure may damage effect global warming. consequently, respect effect global warming, tendency africa increase poverty, exacerbation poor sanitation outbreak epidemic. ignore environmental sustainability, even lead short-run economic gains, hurt poor people undermine long-run poverty reduction (undp, 2003). the two areas, economic growth environment interrelated. therefore development one coexist development other. the exclusion account value nature economic indicator gross national product (gnp) human development index (hdi), give subordinate role nature promote growth; addition this, property right natural capital frequently difficult establish (dasgupta, 2002). dasgupta’s analysis world bank estimate genuine investment countries, discover account use incomplete, include measure water resources, air water pollution, biodiversity among measures. in addition, dasgupta point shadow price strategy aim measure social worth good service economy questionable. despite setbacks, author appreciative price model. dasgupta state gnp human development index measure economic growth time provide contradict evidence. evidence support find dasgupta show change sub-saharan net save rate positive negative year 1976 2000, cost environmental degradation natural resource depletion take account (undp 2003). another measure environmental deterioration case pollution, undps global environment monitor system (gems), however system take degradation account (jha whalley, 1999). the relationship economic growth impact environment ably demonstrate kuznets curve. the kuznets curve state invert u-shaped relationship economic growth environment. negative environmental externality increase steadily proportionately economic growth turn point initial stage economic development (see chart below). once turn point reached, economy begin place emphasis importance environment, devote resource negate negative effect environment. a consequence, environmental pollution degradation begin decline since country capacity invest environmental friendly technology. similar result find grossman kruger (1995). source: robert t. deacon catherine s. norman*, doe environmental kuznets curve describe how individual country behave? university california, santa barbara april 5, 2004 4 bi review 74/2004 however critic model [common, 1995, shafik 1994, selden song, 1994, lopez, 1994], argue may irreversible environmental damage top curve reached, model hold environmental indicators. elasticity substitution factor production, pollution consumer utility must take account. empirical evidence south korea (lim, 1997) show relationship economic growth environment cannot simply explain trade-off invert u-shape relationship. the result attribute worsen (increase) indicator co2 industrial waste per caput income increase contrast indicator water quality domestic waste experience u-shaped relationship. other factor pollution due transportation find possibly low people live close together (selden song, 1994). globalisation result spill technology knowledge develop country several middle-income many industrialise economy via foreign direct investment (fdi) research development (r&d) efforts, thereby leave develop country lag behind (panayotou, 2000). panayotou note failure provide evidence occurrence lax environmental standard emerge economy lead fdi, account fact investment decision manufacture plant multinationals invest country base factor political stability, favourable economic policy, labour quality, infrastructural developments. it therefore clear economic development without costs. in fact, much desire economic growth carefully balance need protect environment may result permanent adverse effect environment country world. specific africa, application model research find lend caution. with continental economy still face numerous problem extent national economy yet provide sufficiently nationals, unlikely point would soon reach africa’s economic growth, adequate resource become available commitment environmental concerns. in words, think need give social background utilisation resource economic growth depend. the various human social challenge poverty epidemic confront continent may well explain relatively low emphasis policy maker environmental concern compare western counterparts. that said, however, must recognise respect ecosystem, globe one benefit accrue one corner due environmental preservation, accrue entire globe. in regard, measure need develop quickly put africa’s high potential economic growth path environmentally sustainable. deliberate action need take successfully transfer environmentally friendly technology africa. a case point use solar technology, achievement thus far promising. most africa endow solar energy, transform usable energy would substitute widespread use wood fire energy majority continent’s population. in addition, prove technology resource need devote research development. further, solar energy circumvent cost relate generation distribution yet another clean source energy, hydro-energy. in addition generation, distribution hydroelectricity present africa unique challenge supply network grid due vast landscape constitute rural set majority population resides. this part wide infrastructural constraint continent yet overcome. 4. africa world economy in real sector, number african export experience overall increase price 2003. international gold price increased, much benefit continent top producers, south africa ghana. likewise, oil price increase period lead high revenue country nigeria, equatorial guinea, chad (adb, 2003). the development middle east, iraq particular result soar oil price reach high us$50 per barrel, due insecurity uncertainty pertain global oil supply. both gold oil price expect maintain high price throughout 2004. increase foreign asset obtain export earn real sector effect improve capability oil export african country release fund towards achievement environmental goals. in line expectation heavily indebted poor country (hipc) initiative, many heavily indebted african state cut fiscal expenditure focus stay within set targets. attainment hipc initiative completion point, lead much need debt bi review 74/2004 5 cancellation paris club member result overall improve financial position economies. failure reach target however prolong reduce fiscal expenditure. despite long-term economic benefit hipc initiative achieve mdgs, short medium-term growth strategy development concern environment area constricted. 4.1 prospect economic growth the prospect economic growth africa remain bright. the african union (au) currently make effort towards ensure political stability continent aim promote foreign domestic investor confidence. international support new partnership africa’s development (nepad) lead increase aid 2002; trend expect continue 2003 (oecd, adb). the future outlook performance real sector set improve due to: • low production cost (labour, electricity, water, among inputs); • comparative advantage area specialise agricultural production; • numerous investment opportunity available mine sector, remain largely untapped, despite richness variety mineral africa. the scope improvement environmental sustainability africa, hence economic growth extremely vast; • expansion market regional integration within africa necessary network facilitate increase capacity utilisation among exist potential productive businesses; • additional area improvement include expansion hydroelectric power facility along major river nile, congo zambezi provide viable source clean energy majority population, presently primarily rely biomass fuel.3 for african continent embrace potential benefit globalisation, vital african country implement supportive fiscal monetary framework promote investment. prudent policy area provide important contribution macroeconomic stability, key prerequisite economic growth. in addition, african country must commence process add value export product compete interact global market. 5. environmental protection due high dependence rural community common property, necessary local government implement environmental policy order protect right poor, affect quality environment worsens. data village zimbabwe estimate proportion household income common property high 40% (dasgupta, 2002). a number environmental protection campaign currently execute several african countries. one campaign national soil fertility action plan, currently prepare 23 countries. in addition development, 15 national action plan submit within unite nation convention combat desertification (unccd). natural resource need maintain order provide livelihood largely communal rural communities, part depend forests, open natural resource survival. it show tanzania poor derive much half cash income sale forest products, charcoal, honey, firewood wild fruit (undp 2003). this true sub-saharan african country in addition, method use purify mineral gold small-scale rural people involve pollution river toxic chemicals. regional institution africa work towards implementation development programme aim reduce pressure natural resource various area continent. general concern region africa primarily encompass problem deforestation, scarcity water resources, access clean water sources, access non-pollutant energy source electricity. primary concern northern part eastern, western, southern 3 the world summit sustainable development (rio +10), african preparatory conference world summit sustainable development nairobi, 15-18 october 2001. 6 bi review 74/2004 sub-regions

worth note rich country 16% world population emit 51% world green house gas (undp, 2003). the kyoto protocol yet implement due non-ratification key develop countries, happen emitter substantial amount world greenhouse gas (russia ratify protocol september 2004). a unite nation forest forum (unff) establish 2000 promote management, conservation, sustainable development forests. the institution effectively serf monitor national, regional, global development forests. unite nation organisation unite nation environmental program (unep), unite nation development programme (undp), unite nation convention combat desertification (unccd), world bank do commendable job implement multiple project aim promote environmental sustainability africa. these organisation provide financial technical support programme design promote environmental sustainability africa. african government pledge support programmes. 6. recommendation from foregoing, clear environmental protection goal realise order achieve sustainable economic growth. effective environmental protection policy relate primarily effect degradation depletion environment need implement maintain institution individual level society namely, local government national, regional, 4 environment canada, international relations, international agreements, 1998 http://www.ec.gc.ca/international/multilat/ ozone_e.htm5 kyoto protocol,

constraint rapid urbanisation, poverty, poor legislation inadequate capacity implement enforce legislative control exist. the trend population growth develop countries, estimate 95% total world population growth occur africa, latin america, asia next 30 year (post-lawrence-weber, 1999). the result increase strain natural resource due imminent population boom africa checked, cause many setback economic growth human development. it therefore advisable strict environmental policy implement country offset encounter negative developments. the anticipate future demographic pressure urban area due shift expand population city town search job ultimately result increase level air pollution, pressure transportation facilities, urban sanitation, access clean water supply, waste disposal. the total population africa project reach 1,941 million year 2050, approximately 885 million 2004 (ashford, 2004). accord statistic collect un-habitat 2002 un 2002, indicate world total 923,986 thousand urban slum dwellers, 869,918 thousand (94.1%) develop countries, africa account 187,563 thousand 20% (undp, 2003). it important local government ensure adequate plan policy order accommodate predict rise population. local government must also ensure implementation effective policy mean regulate activity arise globalisation african economy expansion number urban industries, need land cultivate commercial crops, well support need increase area subsistence farming. another fundamental aspect need urgent attention issue collect accurate data environmental pollution degradation relate statistic environment. item farm method employed, pace clear land settlements, charcoal burning, presently include exist statistics. appropriate measurement provide precise indicator weight quantitative value negative environmental externality economic development africa. chinese policy maker adopt use “green gdp” (the economist, august 21st 2004), take account environmental cost economic development. a well-defined weight system role environment economic growth ultimately result attention confer environmental sustainability development appropriate policy necessary effective environmental management support sustainable economic growth. 7. conclusion while pollution largely affect develop countries, environmental degradation pertinent feature develop nations. study show environmental sustainability link factor economic development. therefore advancement one cannot occur without advancement other. environmental degradation africa exacerbate poverty due reliance majority poor natural resources. in world today, 900 million people live absolute poverty rural area depend consumption natural product livelihood (undp, 2003). unfortunately, activity method use derive economic value natural resource environmentally sustainable. moreover, resultant economic benefits, instances, accrue current consumption sustainable development resource address negative consequence environment could drawn. in africa, activity include unplanned quarrying, spontaneous trench dig small-scale mining, shift cultivation, indiscriminate cut tree energy, inappropriate small-scale mineral process use water poor waste management, include indiscriminate kill wild animal (poaching) game parks. the way forward address issue relate implementation supportive government policy regard environmental management environmental sustainability. regional international policy environmental management, governance, conservation important role play area, environmental decision one economy may adversely affect economies. the achievement environmental goal facilitate achievement mdgs. equally important transfer technology friendly environment globalisation take root. 8 bi

fund madam manage director - m muyenga distinguish invite guest lady gentleman good evening! i wish thank manage director zambia state insurance corporation limit - m muyenga, invite wife guest honour end year cocktail party. despite fact bank zambia directly associate insurance industry, function give rare opportunity say something relationship bank zambia insurance industry. in past years, bank zambia take keen interest operation performance insurance company pension funds. this insurance company pension fund direct impact macro-economic variables, since lead player government security market. whenever government wish raise funds, institution together commercial bank provide them. lady gentlemen, many agree recent downward trend stabilisation macro-economic variables, interest, inflation, exchange rates, induce high level investor confidence economy. a many u aware, stable macroeconomic environment one critical ingredient achieve sustainable economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction, country. in regard, allow reiterate i say forum insurance industry play critical role economic growth development country. here zambia, insurance industry, gross annual premium approximately k273 billion life non-life business, k550 billion pensions, control colossal sum money could use investment locally; properly regulate could contribute develop strong financial sector zambia. however, problem insurance industry under-regulated many years. in respect, high time regulation put place harmonise operation important industry. i several time tell insurance act 1997 inadequate many area licensing, separation life non-life business investment outside country. i similarly tell pension scheme regulation act 1996 equally deficient. to make matter worse, zambian public insufficient knowledge insurance matters. in addition, industry fail co-operate enable handle mega risk stop externalisation insurance funds. unlike banker association zambia (baz), whose existence strength cement bank themselves, insurance industry loose arrangement promote common front. there neither write bind memorandum understand among insurance company foster cooperation thorny issue confront insurance industry today! however, i must acknowledge here, organisation call insurer association zambia (iaz), whose membership compulsory may strong guide membership. bi review 74/2004 1 lady gentlemen, observation, insurance pension industry zambia face many challenges. these include: 1) amendment insurance act 1997 pension scheme regulation act 1996 law regulation impose strict corporate governance practice structure institution manage pension insurance fund introduced; 2) the investment act must harmonise insurance/pensions act way insurance company form already form must local ownership/equity partnership. this would greatly contribute minimise capital flight huge repatriation dividends; 3) need establishment national re-insurance company avoid capital flight; 4) insurance company need harmonise operation client benefit fair competition. in words, data operation insurance company capture easily plan purposes; 5) along lines, insurance company focus core-insurance business, effect reduce outflow capital. if insurance company avenue co-operation amongst themselves, arrangement compensate fore-gone income cede commission could work co-insurance programme. in regard, i call upon counterpart pension insurance authority (pia) strictly supervise industry order ensure, among things, proper investment insure funds. on part bank zambia, would like assure continue support, door open consultations. a i want take much leisure time, i wish conclude thank you, again, accord opportunity share think you. to end, i wish merry christmas profitable new

danish bankers’ association, copenhagen, 1 december 2004. * * * at recent annual meet danish bankers’ association various speaker comment basel framework. this framework set international standard capital adequacy bank organisations. in 1970s g-10 country set basel committee, whose secretariat bank international settlement (bis). locate basel, bi often call central bank central banks. in 1980s basel committee start work formulate international standard capital adequacy bank institutions. in 1988 result basel framework - call basel i framework. this still basis requirement size structure capital bank organisation 100 country world. the strong expansion increase complexity financial market bank organisation since basel i framework draw make necessary formulate sophisticate framework. the basel committee therefore take draft new international standards, first proposal put forward 1999. this work prove complex expected. the committee several occasion issue consultative paper invite financial world, authority stakeholder comment draft put forward. this process quite comprehensive, also highly valuable, since give country party opportunity table suggestion constructive criticism. in way, number special circumstance could take consideration. the consultation mean make process le protracted, simplify proposal. nonetheless, 26 june 2004, basel committee close file reach decision new international standards. the framework fill 200 pages, basel i comprise 30 pages. on basis standard european commission put forward draft directive new capital adequacy framework. the directive expect adopt 2006, come force 2007-2008. the new standard course considerably complicate 1988 framework. a noteworthy departure current framework individual bank able choose two different principle compile capital require cover credit risks. large bank may base capital requirement internal risk model, others may opt simple standard method close current principles. the purpose allow difference small local bank large international institution apply sophisticate risk management tools. a always, bank’s board management responsible capital adequacy, include necessary buff ensure sound operations. basel ii set firmly clearly principle supervisory authority must perform overall evaluation individual bank’s need capital. the board management’s assessment need capital must discuss supervisory authority, end may require bank hold capital equivalent minimum requirement 8 per cent. finally, basel ii framework also include standard disclosure information relate risk capital adequacy. the idea behind disclosure requirement set standard soundness bank institution evaluate supervisory authorities, also market participants. monitor authority market combination enhance certainty sign weakness spot time, avoid potential crises. avoid financial crisis is, course, whole purpose exercise. bi review 74/2004 1 the bank play exceptional, central role society. this background extensive regulation bank activities. one sometimes hear remark regulation authority special burden impose banks. this lead argument uniform international regulations, ensure level play field. this purpose basel framework. often bank also point authority remember bank business enterprise need scope manoeuvre order competitive. one could pose theoretical question bank would behave absence regulation authorities. in time, question hypothetical clear answer. however, thought-provoking back day bank subject regulation - first danish bank act 1919 - capital adequacy generally far high today. around mid-19th century capital reserve approximately 40 per cent balance-sheet total, around 1900 good 20 per cent. in 1920s fall around 12 per cent. today, banks’ net capital average approximately 6 per cent balance-sheet total. a comparison nature naturally take literally, although may lead realisation regulation perceive burden, perhaps valuable asset! on 1 january 2005 eu’s new account regulation come force. it introduce international account standard (ias) also affect banks’ financial statements. the fact - special eu version - also pose particular problem mortgage-credit institute also mention here. with ias, previous danish account principle financial enterprise state security market value long apply every case. danmark nationalbank regret new rule element security portfolio subject cost measurement. so far agreement denmark market value regular principle. however, defer need uniform rule within eu, market valuation security consistently applied. the interplay ia rule basel ii especially significant danish banks. so far, apply prudent principle compilation loss provisions. instead, ia rule introduce neutrality principle assessment provision requirement. the term state case: bank must long quite prudent evaluation need provisions. this may require substantial provision carry back, reduce banks’ buff potential losses. to put another way, change principle may release substantial fund danish banks. add this, introduction basel ii rule reduction capital requirement danish bank expected, since loan household well small medium-sized enterprise subject low risk weight new framework. these loan weigh relatively heavily denmark. in overall terms, considerable relaxation capital requirement provisions. so important board management various bank consider carefully much capital need order ensure appropriate buff case unforeseen adverse events. in order promote process, current bill financial business act anticipate basel ii framework. already 2005 requirement introduce bank must ass need capital engage dialogue danish financial supervisory authority respect. the bill require disclosure result deliberations. since provisional rule prior full implementation basel ii framework argument disclosure. the year involve perceive running-in period previous dialogue bank authority concern provision supplement dialogue capital adequacy. danmark nationalbank would like emphasise, however, assessment need capital disclose full basel ii framework implemented. 2 bi review 74/2004 the financial market financial product become technically advance

stability-oriented monetary policy necessary condition long term growth speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, unice competitiveness day, brussels, 9 december 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it pleasure today address distinguish audience, best represent european entrepreneurial capacity dynamism. today i would like discus first general role policy institution develop market economy. i shall dwell specifically conduct monetary fiscal policy euro area contribute foster high sustainable output growth job creation. finally, i shall stress importance structural reform labour product market ensure economy endow degree flexibility need firm worker able withstand successfully challenge contemporaneous, highly interrelate world economy pose us. the determinant sustainable long term growth the determination factor increase individuals’ standard live main issue scholar analyse since economics bear modern science 250 year ago. the evolution economic theory greatly further deepen understand issue. nevertheless, one core conclusion remain today important late eighteenth century: amount good service produce give economy grow high possible rate rule market economy applied. we learn prescription cannot possibly translate pure laissez-faire doctrine, production exchange good service carry without proper legal institutional framework potential economy would fully exploited. for reason, society need equip right framework, enhance collective welfare clearly define ensure property right ensure efficient supply public goods. this mean particular economic policy must ensure individual necessary incentive earn income work produce good service individual need. it also mean enterprise must take decision basis market signal without rely subsidy protect competition. this foster accumulation human physical capital high level employment, determinant long term growth. to fulfil objective, economic policy must create maintain “stable” macroeconomic environment, ensure appropriate level flexibility economic system provide incentive work invest physical human capital order maximise employment output growth. in europe particularly euro area, stability macroeconomic framework flexibility economic structure two guide principle economic policy enshrine treaty lisbon agenda, respectively. how principle best apply practice? the role stability orient monetary policy let start illustrate role ecb’s monetary policy play foster long term output growth euro area. the eu treaty establish maintenance price stability primary objective ecb. this objective refer general price level euro area ecb make clear aim keep inflation (as measure harmonise index consumer prices) close 2% medium term. the ecb necessary credible delivery price stability - line definition - time, include medium long term. by credibly maintain price stability, ecb bring decisive contribution long run output growth, several channels. bi review 74/2004 1 first, price stability ensure transparency relative price mechanism, thus enhance efficiency resource allocation. in environment price stability economic agent easily discern change relative value single good service produce well labour capital. in situation increase inflation, instead, resource could wrongly allocate production good service whose relative demand increased. furthermore, household may difficulty discern relative price good service thus choose consumption bundle turn suboptimal. preserve price stability also contribute foster private consumption. low inflation support private consumption via positive impact real value households’ income wealth. another important channel price stability foster economic growth consist reduction borrow cost individual firms. a know, inflation erode purchase power nominal return long term loan contract bonds. in case high uncertain inflation, saver lend liquid fund would require high rate return borrowers, order compensate high risk relate uncertainty future inflation. this inflation risk premium imply economy high inflation, le investment project rather high rate return profitable. in circumstances, capital accumulation low could situation price stability output growth rate consequently reduced. financial market development past year indeed testimony success ecb’s stability orient monetary policy secure low stable long-term inflation expectation thereby low interest rate euro area. over period 1995 1999, latter year euro replace national currency eleven eu member state ecb start run single monetary policy, long-term inflation expectations, measure consensus economic forecasts, swiftly converge towards “below 2 per cent level”, ecb’s definition price stability, level much high still mid-1990s. such high degree credibility reflect development euro area long term interest rates, begin 1999 decline around 4%, level prevail credible stable currencies, thus result number country economy decline around 9 percentage point since begin 1995. since 1999 ecb’s stability-oriented monetary policy and, overall, ecb credibility deliver price stability remarkably successful contribute maintain finance cost - short term long term 30 year - historically low levels. inflation expectation remain low level significantly affect short-term development actual euro area headline inflation. furthermore, period since start single monetary policy, fluctuation key macroeconomic variable decline significantly. in comparison average level first half nineties, volatility long-term inflation expectation (as measure consensus economic forecast) decline one half. from long term perspective, compare average level record 1980s first half ninety observe volatility inflation long term interest rate decline around three quarters. furthermore, latter period decline volatility real gdp employment figure one quarter also associate contribution successful stability-oriented macro-economic policy euro area. the ecb manage monetary policy systematic transparent manner private agent best possible condition gauge likely evolution interest rate response economic developments. first all, ecb clear monetary policy strategy. in addition, ecb inform public monthly press conference hold first govern council meet month economic monetary diagnosis ecb decision take govern council display explain almost real time. the ecb pioneer domain follow central bank keen increase transparency action decisions. this transparency one element contribute macroeconomic stability long-term growth. in environment predictability interest rate movement likely relation key macroeconomic development relatively high, firm good manage balance sheets. this reduce vulnerability economic shock risk management cost create condition good decision regard domestic foreign investment. finally, i would like stress importance maintain price stability enhance function labour market contribute sound nominal wage development competitive unit 2 bi review 74/2004 labour costs, foster firms’ competitiveness, growth job creation. in credible regime low inflation worker ask extra-wage increase compensate inflation risk firm trade union know ex-ante firm able pas high wage consumer prices. this help avoid excessive nominal increases, thus enhance ability firm efficiently manage production cost create new jobs. at current juncture, important second round effect wage price set arise recent increase oil prices. such effect observe till now. all economic agent know without doubt vigilant respect; trust vigilance credibility decisively contribute prevent second round effects. the role stability orient fiscal policy of great importance maintenance macroeconomic stability long term growth sound public finances. the stability growth pact, complement specify eu treaty, provide set rule national fiscal authority aim ensure fiscal soundness, avoid excessive deficit safeguard government finances, define attainment medium-term budgetary position “close balance surplus”. far straightjacket national policymakers, rule derive experience accumulate past decade show increase debt ratio - well implicit debt associate social security system age society - cast permanent shadow long term output growth constantly limit scope fiscal policy act stabilise instrument. although implementation far satisfactory, see stability growth pact bring significant improvement fiscal performance eu years. in major economy outside europe fiscal deficit reach high level recent economic slowdown, ratio debt gdp country worrisome path. in contrast, euro area public finance weather economy cyclical downturn aggregate deficit gdp ratio remain 2% 3% debt gdp ratio moderately rising. while le ecb - well council commission - hop for, significant achievement europe early 1990s average deficit gdp ratio 5% still recorded. the euro area good start position, term macro-economic policies, compare number major economy emerge phase economic slowdown. these achievement time time forget ongoing debate stability growth pact, demonstrate important europe weaken pact. a ecb repeatedly clarify several occasions, important stability growth pact excessive deficit procedure remain key cornerstone economic union. let u never forget cannot monetary union (mu) without economic union (eu), make coherent economically rational emu. this imply pact excessive deficit procedure respect current form. their implementation could improved, particular regard preventive arm pact, ie implementation rule aim avoid excessive deficit arise first place. experience show financial market uncertain future soundness fiscal policy, stage long term interest rate likely increase. this tend exert negative impact private investment physical capital formation. ultimately, unsound fiscal policy reduce production, output suffer permanent loss consumption possibility diminish long run. to sure, monetary union, like euro area, shield country expect follow unsustainable fiscal course sooner late force pay high credit risk premia government bond relative discipline country union. the treaty explicitly prohibit individual governments, run policy sustainable, bailed-out government ecb. in recent year budgetary development euro area fully satisfactory grow concern among market participant observer consensus importance fiscal discipline weaken euro area. while fiscal account euro area affect sluggish economic growth experience past two three years, undeniable that, general, resilience fiscal deficit euro area mainly due high - and, sometimes, high - structural public expenditure, which, definition, dependent cyclical developments. bi review 74/2004 3 it crucial importance euro area member state take advantage ongoing recovery focus pursuit balance budget surplus medium term. such policy would contribute ensure condition long-term growth euro area strengthen meet challenge arise age population. empirical evidence support conclusion comprehensive fiscal consolidation programmes, appropriately design credible, favourable effect confidence, investment condition thereby output growth even short term. notably, fiscal reform base consolidation public expenditure rather increase taxation, adjustment fiscal account would tend support private consumption investment - current expect tax disposable income household firm increases. comprehensive credible expenditure-based fiscal stabilisation programme would particular positive supply effect well. a number empirical study suggest two main reason case. first, low expect deficit reduce long term market interest rates, create opportunity invest increase productive potential economy. second, follow reduction labour taxation possible public expenditure reduced, expectation high after-tax income induce high labour supply mitigate wage increases, thus boost country’s international competitiveness job creation. the role structural reform a stability orient macroeconomic policy framework sufficient ensure high long-term growth achieved. when private agent take decision consumption, save investment, also impediment form unnecessary excessive regulations. a sound monetary fiscal policy framework complement structural policy make economy flexible dynamic. since march 2000, european council launch lisbon agenda, european national governments, parliament social partner become increasingly aware importance implement substantial, courageous far-reaching agenda structural reforms. the ecb, side, fully endorse lisbon agenda share objectives. we also agree main conclusion high level group chair wim kok - preparation mid-term review lisbon strategy - stress advantage sharpen focus key issue order revamp structural reform process europe. indeed, last decade, euro area country make tangible progress structural reform programs. competition product market due to, example, low level state aid de-regulatory measure increased, especially network industries. this result significant downward price effect sector like telecommunication. the ecb support strongly government courageously embark reform underestimate difficulty implement them. in particular prove difficult previously expect european government social partner implement labour market reform could strengthen positive employment trend record eu second half 1990s. break reform deadlock utmost importance, also light grow role play new economy international market place expose european firm new challenge competitive pressures. it intention today provide suggestion government, parliament social partner specific policy actions, clear area labour market reform, increase flexibility suppleness view maximize job creation augment capacity outsiders, like unskilled youth, enter job market essence. in another domain number country lengthen retirement age, allow worker work long hour per week reduction non-wage cost labour - like labour income taxation social security contribution - necessary increase labour supply demand, thus raise productive capacity economy. recent event involve number important euro area company demonstrate social partner aware collective benefit induce good management resource utilisation, worker employer could agree measure would preserve competitiveness consolidate jobs. moreover, measure facilitate worker reallocation, reduce employment trap - due generous unemployment subsidy high marginal income tax - cost relate adjustment 4 bi review 74/2004 labour force often useful increase resilience economy unforeseen shocks. a flexible economy make easy corporate sector maintain competitiveness without large cut employment. finally, flexible cost structure increase expect rate return private investment physical capital research education labour force. hence, productivity quality labour force employ increase, thereby set stage virtuous dynamic lead high output growth. conclusion all policymakers call play role make euro area dynamic economy. by maintain price stability, credible deliver medium long term, ecb make indispensable contribution foster growth euro area. the rate potential economic growth much depend also policy actors. it require fiscal policy sound sustainable, require reform ensure structure economy flexible supple enough augment growth potential europe allow economic agent respond smoothly economic shocks. in rapidly change environment, new technological advances, it area, extremely powerful seem comparable start industrial revolution, creativity conceptual innovation flourish economic sectors, particularly global financial system, economic globalisation rapidly transform structure world economy, euro area 306 million fellow citizen call adapt order take advantage opportunity offer new world respond new challenges. a lot do europe last 20 years: combination bold single market endeavour start mid eighty single currency start end ninety perhaps strike historical set structural reform level continent peace time. we prove able move restructure. we still lot wim kok wisely strongly recommending. in respect, permit last remark: moment i speak reform necessary level continent implement success european economies, generally basis bi-partisan consensus large accord entrepreneur unions. benchmarking particular domain structural reform entire euro area european union best european performer might well powerful tool make necessary progress. let’s it! i thank attention. bi review 74/2004 5 ewart s williams: challenge face caribbean centre monetary study open remark mr ewart s williams, governor central bank trinidad tobago, thirty-sixth annual monetary study conference, jointly host central bank trinidad tobago caribbean centre monetary studies, st augustine, 1-4 november 2004. * * * on behalf management staff central bank trinidad tobago, i wish extend warm welcome participant (especially guest caribbean afield), thirty-sixth annual monetary study conference. the central bank especially please collaborate caribbean centre monetary study jointly host conference, 40th anniversary year. i note conference exist almost long central bank become important fixture conference agenda caribbean. it, fact start as, regional programme monetary studies, 1968, leadership sir alister mcintyre, (who then, director institute social economic research st. augustine campus university west indies). a dr. jackson indicated, first conference really intend focus implication new sterling agreement follow devaluation pound sterling currency pegged. the agenda also include topics: (i) financial account caribbean; (ii) operation insurance companies; (iii) development eastern caribbean currency area; (iv) design ideal account framework plantation economy. it’s interesting, many continue burn issue today. for many year conference continue staged, process close collaboration regional central banks, university west indie university guyana, essentially administer university. and need pay tribute “essentially unpaid co-ordinators” yeoman work keep programme alive: professor compton bourne, maurice odle, adlith browne ramesh ramsaran. in may 1995, uwi regional central bank sign formal agreement establish caribbean centre monetary study (the ccms). the core mission centre provide caricom central bank timely economic intelligence well monetary financial policy advice by: (i) conduct relevant research; (ii) develop regional repository monetary, financial economic information; (iii) disseminate research find seminars, conference workshop including, course, annual monetary study conference. it widely recognize monetary study programme ccms serve region well. perhaps one endure contribution programme provision train grind many regions’ note economists. in fact, several prominent regional well national policy maker “cut teeth”, programme. over years, ccms, part, develop impressive range publication cover theoretical policy issues. the caricom economic performance convergence report one main outputs, provide important comparative information regional economic performance, prove quite useful deliberation committee central bank governors. the centre also establish network research associates, draw regional international community. the relationship cultivate network allow provision joint research relevance caribbean region. bi review 73/2004 1 ccms break new grind year ago annual senior level policy seminar provide important forum discussion practical issue importance business community. these seminar tremendous success. globalisation rapid evolution regional financial environment create new challenge caribbean central bank quest maintain monetary financial stability. it view ccms critical role play help u address challenges. and i think ccms could provide critical support number ways. firstly, i think ccms could contribute economic financial intelligence regional level expansion regional database provide up-to-date information financial sector performance. secondly, i think ccms must get involve joint research regional central bank urgent issue confront u - issue conduct monetary financial policy different exchange rate regimes: exchange rate management: issue monetary financial sector policy co-ordination context csme. of course, i fully aware kind challenge ccms faces, least financial resource constraint. the central bank trinidad tobago strong supporter ccms i feel regional central bank prepare finance center level facilitate recruitment maintenance high-quality staff. uwi strong supporter ccms university may also maintain high quality center monetary research. and finally, time may come need look private financial community - banks, insurance company - contribute finance ccms, even pay research. let’s face it, stand benefit work could emanate well-staffed, well-resourced high quality regional center monetary financial studies. with words, mr. chairman, i would like wish participant stimulate successful conference. 2 bi review 73/2004 jean-claude trichet: testimony committee economic monetary affair european parliament introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, committee economic monetary affair european parliament, brussels, 30 november 2004. * * * madame la présidente, membres de la commission economique et monétaire, j’ai l’honneur de paraître devant votre commission aujourd’hui dans le cadre de notre dialogue régulier. je réjouis beaucoup de ce dialogue qui place l’union economique et monétaire européenne au premier ring parmi le économies industrialisées en ce qui concerne la fréquence et la profondeur du dialogue entre le parlement et l’institut d’emission. je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire actuelle. ich möchte außerdem zu aktuellen themen d fiskalpolitik und zum fortschritt im bereich d strukturreformen stellung nehmen, insbesondere im hinblick auf den lissabon prozess und jüngste produktivitätsentwicklungen d wirtschaft de euroraums. 1. economic monetary development after positive development first half 2004, recent data indicate growth dynamic moderate somewhat second half year. real gdp growth third quarter 2004 estimate 0.3% quarter quarter, follow growth rate 0.7 % 0.5 % previous two quarters. although difficult interpret certainty estimate third quarter give lack breakdown components, appear contribution net export negative, inventory build strong private consumption growth remain sluggish. these development seem relate particular effect increase oil prices, reduce real disposable income euro area also dampen global economic growth. despite adverse impact oil prices, number condition remain place euro area continue grow 2005, albeit somewhat slow pace previously anticipated. on external side, global growth moderating, nonetheless remain robust. in context, euro area export continue benefit favourable global demand conditions. on domestic side, investment support global environment, favourable finance condition euro area, solid profit great corporate efficiency gain business restructuring. finally, scope private consumption strengthen, particular uncertainty surround extent pace implementation structural reform reduced. the outlook economic activity, globally domestically, continue surround uncertainties, particular result present possible future development oil market dampen strength recovery inside outside euro area. in event, important second-round effect wage price-setting avoided. in addition, would essential refrain take measure would prolong necessary adjustment process. finally, monetary policy must remain firmly commit objective maintain price stability medium term. over recent months, oil price development also significant impact consumer price inflation. in november, annual hicp inflation estimate eurostat 2.2%, 2.4% october. in addition, increase indirect tax administer price early year notable effect consumer prices. look ahead, inflation rate likely remain 2% come months, moderate thereafter absence additional upward shocks. the information available suggest strong underlie inflationary pressure build euro area. wage increase remain moderate recent quarters. in context moderate economic growth, trend continue future. there number upward risk price stability. such risk mainly associate oil price developments, uncertainty regard future increase indirect tax administrative prices, potential second-round effect stem wage price-setting behaviour. in respect, bi review 73/2004 1 essential long-term inflation expectation remain solidly anchor definition price stability affect current upward movement hicp inflation. our monetary analysis also call vigilance regard upside risk price stability medium term. the shorter-term dynamic m3 growth strengthen recent months. this seem much relate low level interest rate euro area. this low level interest rate also fuel private sector demand credit. in particular, demand loan house purchase strong, support strong house price dynamic several euro area countries. the growth loan non-financial corporation also pick recent months. a result persistently strong growth m3 past years, remain substantially liquidity euro area need finance non-inflationary growth. this could pose risk price stability medium term. in addition, persistently high excess liquidity strong credit growth could also become source unsustainable asset price increases, particularly property markets. such development need monitor carefully. i would like make remark fiscal policies. many government currently process finalise 2005 budgets. while number country manage maintain sound budgetary position recent years, five euro area country expect commission deficit close 3% gdp year next. this disappoint development. it reflect insufficient commitment address exist structural imbalances. the current economic environment utilise embark comprehensive budget consolidation needed. this would send strong confidence-inspiring signal objective sound public finance growth-friendly environment pursued. turn european fiscal framework, remain convince need change text treaty stability growth pact. have say that, see room improvement way fiscal rule implemented. in particular, need ensure pursuit prudent fiscal policy good time strong focus public debt sustainability. in respect, commission’s proposal concern so-called “preventive arm” pact welcome warrant consideration. a regard so-called “corrective arm” pact, however, ecb concern proposal could undermine nominal anchor 3% deficit-to-gdp ratio. this anchor fiscal framework essential maintain expectation fiscal discipline. this contribute macroeconomic stability, economic growth employment creation. the excessive deficit procedure stability growth pact remain foundation trust confidence emu. in respect, reliable timely government statistic vital importance credibility budgetary surveillance process. the european account rule must fully respect record type expenditure revenue. this do manner consistent stable time homogeneous across countries. the procedure must vulnerable political cycles, state ecofin council. country consider quality integrity statistic matter priority. 2. the need structural reform euro area let turn lisbon agenda. the european council intend reinforce process structural reform 2000 onwards. however, almost five year later, european programme become “the competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world [..] 2010” implement promised. in regard, recent report high level group chair wim kok, provide independent assessment lisbon strategy contribute next year’s mid-term review strategy, express urgent call renew impetus. it propose strong commitment national government sharpen lisbon strategy’s focus place particular emphasis acceleration employment productivity growth “via wide range reform policy well wide macroeconomic framework supportive possible growth, demand employment.” the ecb welcome conclusion high level group well subsequent ecofin reaction, also supportive. concern role macroeconomic policy foster success lisbon process, i would like stress independent monetary policy aim 2 bi review 73/2004 deliver price stability credible delivery medium long term, together fiscal policy compliance stability growth pact maintain fiscal sustainability, best contribution macroeconomic policy make facilitate implementation reforms. price stability necessary condition effective foster sustainable growth well support employment social cohesion, thus support lisbon objective which, turn, another necessary condition enhance growth job creation. consequently, conclude ecofin council first reaction kok report, macroeconomic framework need supportive stability growth. a increase incentive implement reforms, ecb past point supportive role transparent effective benchmarking base sensibly define quantitative indicators. apart create peer pressure accountability side policymakers, benchmarking crucial driver public discussion eu, raise public awareness benefit european citizen could derive term growth job creation necessary reforms. this reasonable approach implementation lisbon strategy context structural reform responsibility member states. in absence sufficient progress structural reform, weak productivity growth contribute low growth performance observe euro area recent years. in 1980s, annual growth rate labour productivity per hour work average 2.3% euro area. it significantly decelerate 1990s reach average 1.2% period 1996-2003. a consequence, gap unite state widen recent years. more specifically, since mid-1990s, gap labour productivity growth unite state euro area average 0.7 percentage point measure per hour worked. however, nearly twice large measure per head due considerable divergence trend average work hour two economies. alongside progress reform direct towards high rate labour utilisation euro area, development recent year reinforce need implement policy aim specifically boost labour productivity. in respect, one main priority lisbon agenda encourage innovation technological diffusion, among key factor affect long-term productivity growth. first, policy aim ease regulations. regulation limit product market competition hind labour market adaptability negative repercussion innovation technological advancements. eu country make significant progress product market reform 1990s, significant barrier competition innovation remain, particular service sectors, urgently need tackled. the ecb would strongly back commission’s initiative respect. second, policy promote investment research development, also important driver innovation. third, policy aim improve human capital. technological advancement imply labour skill change time. therefore, measure favour continuous development human capital contribute innovation, facilitate use advance technology allow technical change translate jobs. to conclude, lisbon agenda incorporate relevant priority promote long-term productivity growth key condition make europe competitive dynamic. the ecb support governments, parliament social partner courageously implement necessary reforms. i ready answer questions. bi review 73/2004 3 hermann remsperger: research matter – sdge model financial sector speech professor hermann remsperger, member executive board deutsche bundesbank, workshop entitle “sdge model financial sector” host technical university darmstadt deutsche bundesbank, eltville, 26-27 november 2004. * * * i often ask role deutsche bundesbank play - five ten years’ time - eurosystem internationally well. my answer always same. over long term importance bundesbank large extent depend position field research. i say many distinguish researcher gather today. nor i say i responsible research centre. no, i want emphasise role research field monetary policy, face time new question call theoretically empirically found answers. at time familiar old problem stability demand money, continually re-analysed. this strive knowledge gain importance also influence national central bank within eurosystem depend predominantly weight arguments. the meet ecb govern council debate club dive hawk everyone know advance others go say interest rates. it precisely monetary policy meet one good idea wind blow term research. so come surprise two focal point research agenda closely tie monetary policy considerations. one dedicate “goals effect monetary policy”. in context monetary transmission process, instance, examine influence corporate heterogeneity effect monetary policy. in addition, concentrate role output gaps, exchange rate monetary aggregate monetary policy. the focal point concern analyse monetary policy influence several long-term development real sector economy. globalisation production one many example area. research paper labour capital supply well potential growth important examples. however, i want create impression central bank concern monetary policy next interest rate decision. a rule, central bank direct attention price stability stability financial system subject much intertwined. in opinion, simple observation far-reaching implication central bank’s research programme. if central bank’s research develop well-organised lines, “ top down”, objective primary focus. you know, price stability long establish first objective central bank therefore price stability remain first objective central bank research. a i see it, financial stability become second top issue central bank research. alongside cooperation departments, research centre take active role field. for example look implication change german financial system financial stability, implementation lend last resort function link soundness bank system credit supply. in addition, project dedicate role financial intermediary business cycle germany . furthermore, investigate best framework implement stress test financial system germany . on top doubt financial stability issue important international dimension, big challenge research. last least research concentrate refinement econometric model forecast methods. in regard, particularly interest promote development “dynamic bi review 72/2004 1 stochastic general equilibrium models” use within bundesbank. these model become backbone theoretical well empirical analysis. in modern economic research approach provide consistent framework connect theoretical foundation empirical evidence. we bundesbank aware necessity include method tool box economic methods. consequently, research programme contain several project use general equilibrium models. a example, base early paper jana kremer, giovanni lombardo thomas werner, interaction monetary fiscal policy, illustrate detail. another project deal cyclical behaviour belief dsge models. the sheer scope research topic constitute major challenge research management. essentially, matter research within central bank organised. i believe research centre like bundesbank essential create synergy effects. but let also emphasise much appreciate support external research professors. they professor jörg breitung bonn professor harald uhlig berlin. we already benefit lot advise hope fruitful collaboration. and also benefit research council follow work critical eye make valuable recommendations. among member research council jürgen von hagen, martin hellwig manfred j m neumann. both peter kugler axel weber leave council. peter kugler’s successor professor jürgen wolters berlin . and president succeed research council charles goodhart. give council membership i sure agree i end say research really matter bundesbank. against background, i please welcome workshop dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model financial sector. the workshop host economic research centre together economist technical university darmstadt. 2 bi review 72/2004 zeti akhtar aziz: global leadership development speech dr zeti akhtar aziz, governor

eurosystem latin american central banks, rio de janeiro, 26 november 2004. * * * let start say debate appropriate exchange rate regime surprisingly lively last years. my impression debate partly boost fact economic theory prove rather lame guide policymakers exchange rate regime choice many country experience severe foreign exchange crisis recent years. in connection, role free capital movement determine performance exchange rate regime appear core recent policy discussions. in 1990s, many economies, i believe, victim economic crises. the fall tightly manage exchange rate regime east asia, russia, brazil, turkey argentina result massive decline live standard countries. these crisis also bring issue optimal exchange rate regime core international policy agenda. while simple recipe optimal choice currency regime country, one safely emphasise importance consistency within exchange regime underlie macroeconomic policy economic fundamentals. it easy agree point regime ultimately substitute sound macroeconomic policies. in short talk i try argue that, current environment high capital mobility, sound fiscal policy choice exchange rate regime even important. i illustrate point highlight general development emerge market two example finland’s neighbour countries. i believe free capital mobility key factor underlie appropriate choice exchange rate regime, also understand recent crisis emerge markets. there broad consensus today sudden reversal capital flow play central role trigger recent crises. compare advance economy emerge market seem prone institutional financial sector weaknesses. consequently, le capable manage large capital flows. capital flow often depend domestic fundamental policy management, also external variables. high interest rate u crisis country bring abrubt change financial condition trigger crisis emerge markets. but domestic policy management important well. recent studies, include one make bank finland, show excessive borrow government private bank seem key reason recent crises. today - free capital mobility - high level indebtedness government domestic bank make country highly vulnerable change investor confidence may easily lead sudden capital outflow subsequent crisis. indeed, public debt, foreign indebtedness bank even m2 reserve important indicator crisis vulnerability. here i would like stress importance sustainable fiscal policy. to illustrate point, i would like discus positive development estonia. the country use succesfully currency board arrangement turbulent period 1990’s. in estonia, average budget deficit le 1% gdp period 1992 2001, public debt level 4% gdp. a appetite risk decline many emerge market country end crises, estonia practically asset sudden capital outflow able occur. indeed, estonia even navigate nicely crisis neighbour russia. interestingly, estonia - along two baltic country - able combine 1) fix exchange rate, 2) liberalisation capital account well-functioning financial system, 3) large current account deficits. at time go deep structural institutional change. this raise interest question. how able manage combination would usually regard inconsistent? in addition sound fiscal policy, small domestic financial market crucial. in baltic country hardly inter-bank markets. the bank sector sell foreigners, and, consequently, bank supervision outsource large extent. after boom bi review 72/2004 1 bust 1997, baltic stock exchange generally stagnated. not economy extremely small, degree monetisation low. a mentioned, public debt absent small. a result, asset market speculative capital flow baltic countries. partially, reflect sound fundamentals, mostly unintended consequence policy decisions. unfortunately, i don’t know easily baltic experience repeat countries. let continue fiscal policy discuss another interest example. namely, recent economic development russia. the crisis 1998 mainly cause excessive government borrowing. before crisis, budget deficit russia 5-12% public debt level exceed 50% gdp. again capital fly away government bond russian assets, crisis materialised. but since 2000, russian government run fiscal surplus debt level decrease le 30% gdp. today nobody seriously predict currency crisis russia, economy grow comfortably 5 7% per year. of course high oil price play important role. in fact russian authority use windfall oil revenue fairly wisely. for example, russian authority recently establish oil stabilisation fund. our beautiful host country seem follow similar path recovery. after crisis 1999, successive brazilian government run sizeable budget surplus public debt level decreased. maybe remarkably, authority improve institutional framework fiscal policy. the fiscal responsibility law voluntary fiscal commitment improve credibility fiscal policy nicely. consequently, interest rate fallen, investment rising, gdp grow satisfactorily around 5%. hopefully, tight fiscal policy continue capital inflow economic growth recovering. if fiscal consolidation continue imitate others, brazilian success story contribute positively stability whole region. give capital mobility need sound macroeconomic policy, emerge economy choose exchange rate regime? rigid exchange rate regime may enhance monetary policy credibility low inflation little cost particularly country low exposure international capital movements. but recent imf study indicates, economy often develop countries. nevertheless, emerge economy relatively large financial market large capital movements, rigid exchange rate system might quite risky choice. a seen, fix rigid exchange rate regime highly vulnerable sudden capital outflow crises. especially domestic fundamental perfect. nowadays many emerge market country choose regime currency float authorities, practice, still target exchange rate level. this fear float may well adequate exchange rate regime many emerge economies. in country credibility still low, dollarisation high intermediation monetary policy unstable. but country develop economically institutionally, flexible exchange rate proper inflation target may well represent le costly regime choice. to conclude, difficult nowadays isolate oneself totally external shock sudden capital movements. but authority emerge market render economy le vulnerable run sustainable fiscal policy choose suitable exchange rate regime. to build sound bank sector might challenging. again difficult isolate bank sector capital movements, authority demand large capital requirements. authority could also supervise currency mismatch bank sector properly. more capital le foreign currency liability might render economy le vulnerable sudden capital movement crises. 2 bi review 72/2004 klaus liebscher: conference european economic integration (ceei) open remark dr klaus liebscher, governor austrian national bank, conference european economic integration (ceei), vienna, 29 november 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure welcome vienna conference european economic integration (ceei). i happy welcome, particular, president european central bank, monsieur jean-claude trichet, go take floor minute deliver keynote speech, president deutsche bundesbank, prof. weber, hold evening’s dinner speech. jean-claude, axel - warm welcome you! i also would like welcome fellow governor follow invitation - let thank highly valuable contribution conference. it also privilege special coordinator stability pact south eastern europe, mr. erhard busek, give introductory statement late morning. we also glad attract many distinguish speaker renowned expert academia, national well international institutions, bank sector. lady gentlemen, about one year ago, i welcome last “east-west conference”. we come together debate “the economic potential large europe - key success” thus revisit important topic previous east-west conferences, human capital formation, financial stability, specification suitable policy mix structural reforms. i proud able say oesterreichische nationalbank follow transition process closely beginnings. already 1989, oesterreichische nationalbank start build international platform - comprise seminars, workshop conference - discus question relate transition process european integration. by 1995, east-west conference establish annual event oenb vienna highlight numerous aspect mutual interest year year. in set 2003 east-west conference, finally, pre-celebrated historic event eu’s enlargement towards east - truly major milestone european integration process. and one month ago process european integration take one step yet again: on 28 october 2004, head state 25 member state three accession country -bulgaria, croatia romania - sign treaty establish constitution europe, need ratify eu country. a result process integration second half 20th century today, european union reach high degree stability prosperity. one may safely assume first half last century people would dare dream period peaceful convergence across europe. despite successes, one acknowledge much remain do strengthen advance european integration. to single major challenges, march 2000, eu council head state government agree new strategic goal, so-called lisbon strategy, european union regard next decade - let quote - “to become competitive dynamic knowledge-based economy world capable sustainable economic growth good job great social cohesion.” however, lack clear decisive progress achieve objectives, recently point report write behalf european commission. the subdue pace economic recovery euro area put spotlight structural inefficiency friction labour product market. the eu single market fully implement order enhance productivity employment, overall, economic growth prosperity. the future european commission, european council government individual member state clearly embrace lisbon strategy speed structural reform order strengthen international competitiveness, foster economic growth support employment. bi review 72/2004 1 the eu, economic monetary union (emu) euro europe’s strategic response global competition associate challenge poses. emu represent key step complete single european market. today, euro area already establish stable monetary anchor global economy. however, essential rest laurels. it acknowledge work hard keep assure success emu future. several government euro area member state repeatedly difficulty fulfil responsibility obligation regard fiscal rules. for stability euro credibility monetary union, essential comply fiscal rule set stability growth pact (sgp), provide clear, transparent simple framework. today’s discussion make sgp rule flexible short-term remedy fiscal problem occur member state counterproductive odds maastrichtconsensus. in mind, sgp work is. the problem implementation. it pact disadvantage failed. it miss several government fulfil responsibility obligation - failed. thus, rule make exceedingly complex contingent many exceptional economic circumstances, clearly weak sgp implementation credibility. therefore, i would like stress return onto path long-term sustainable public finance necessary order foster public trust pillar emu stability architecture cushion possible effect lisbon structural reform agenda well moderate challenge age society europe. where central eastern europe enter picture? the deepen european union come along widen european union. since fall iron curtain 15 year ago, central eastern european country make impressive successful, often painful, experience transition market economies; effort crown accession eu. membership include commitment eventual adoption euro. the creation euro area base sustainable fulfilment maastrichtconvergence criteria, apply future euro area entrant way. these criterion form coherent package base set economic indicator neither negotiable subject change. from legal perspective, ensure continuity equal treatment, economic perspective, logic last convergence change important country different stage economic development. a point last convergence report ecb, new member state still way go nominal real convergence euro area differ considerably new member states. therefore, reform effort implementation sound policies, especially fiscal field, still require way monetary union. in light, weaken stability growth pact would certainly send wrong signal new eu country. i doubt success european integration past continue future. a mention before, oesterreichische nationalbank (oenb) closely track analyze process european integration central eastern european countries. to keep interest public inform economic topic pertain region, host “east-west conference” year year publish “focus transition” twice year. since process european integration permanently close divide use run across europeand since new central eastern european eu member state successfully complete transition step - therefore long label transition economy - good reason update name two important products. our conference publication complimentary products. therefore decide choose common name. this year’s conference first take place new name: “conference european economic integration (ceei)”, name reflect growing-together europe. in parallel, relaunched “focus transition” ”focus european economic integration”. the first issue publish recently. hand hand rename also renew structure content products, effort greatly aid result reader survey conduct year. we continue investigate economic topic relevant new central eastern european eu countries, adoption euro. furthermore, use opportunity extend geographical focus region south east europe. 2 bi review 72/2004 this year’s “conference european economic integration” entitle “south eastern european challenge prospects” dedicate especially part europe; comprises, understand it, country albania, bosnia herzegovina, bulgaria, croatia, macedonia, romania, serbia montenegro. since eight central eastern european country join eu, eu integration process clearly shift south east. apart romania, bulgaria croatia, next candidate accession, south eastern european country accession perspective, recently state european commission. the stability pact south eastern europe assist difficult catching-up process region. we hear pact late today. for completeness, let shortly mention case turkey. last month, european commission recommend start accession negotiation turkey. base report recommendation european commission, european council expect make decision december 17. lady gentlemen, let perhaps shortly illustrate oenb pronounce interest country central eastern europe, region south east europe. with enlargement, austria move close geographic centre european union. eu integration come along economic integration. economic financial relation austria central eastern european country substantially deepen since end cold war. central eastern european country develop one prime destination austria’s foreign direct investments. austria main foreign investor slovenia third large czech republic slovakia. austrian company situate eu’s new central european member state employ 220,000 persons. at time, austrian company business south eastern europe. austrian banks, particular, play major role bank sector part europe. in albania, austrian share total bank asset reach impressive 51%; bosnia herzegovina almost 50%; croatia share amount around 40%. due strong involvement austrian commercial bank south eastern europe impact financial stability austrian bank sector, essential oesterreichische nationalbank monitor analyze region closely. at time, aim provide good understand region, people, even expert central eastern europe, still “terra incognita”. so far, much research devote region. however, south eastern europe promise major focus european integration dynamic come year already among fast grow region continent. we much hope programme put together conference european economic integration offer new insight into, good understand region whose political economic perspective heterogeneous. this morning start presentation president european central bank, jean-claude trichet. we look forward profound inspire keynote speech, jean-claude, greatly appreciate participation conference. after that, idea first session give overview political economic situation south eastern europe. with introductory statement erhard busek expect get first-hand knowledge stability pact south eastern europe. the afternoon first conference day dedicate issue monetary exchange rate policy. today’s conference conclude president weber, give dinner speech change focus european economic integration. between two sessions, winner oenb’s olga radzyner award announced. this award establish commemorate olga radzyner, former head foreign research division oesterreichische nationalbank, die tragic flight accident august 1999. the olga radzyner award bestow young economist central eastern europe excellent research focus monetary finance issue economics. the second day start session fdi trade pivotal element catch improve competitiveness south east europe, follow session serious regional challenges: high joblessness, poverty brain drain. to highlight foothold austrian bank bi review 72/2004 3 region, last session dedicate bank south eastern europe lead role austrian commercial banks. lady gentlemen, we hope conference make important contribution set stage future interest in, research public awareness focus emerge europe. let pas distinguish key-note speaker, president trichet. jean-claude, floor yours! 4 bi review 72/2004 antonio fazio: regulation supervision financial market presentation antonio fazio, governor bank italy, frankfurt european

this mean traditional big user oil develop country compete resource way accustom past. a rise oil price could well seem quite like supply shock scenario - high price low output. hence, oil price

adverse impact energy price changes. either that, tension various markets, resolution fascinate watch. but main point still current level oil price mainly sign global demand strength - strength different place historical patterns. for australia, global growth situation strong enough exert upward pressure energy (and resource) prices, growth weight towards asia, seem moment quite favourable one. ***** accord national accounts, australia record moderate growth 2004. it look like gdp growth four quarter december le 3 per cent unless big surprise december quarter upward revision previous quarters. let leave aside apparent contrast picture paint various business surveys, considerably stronger, moment take figure given. that leaf growth run slowly anticipate early year. but output growth fell slightly short expectations, due apparent lack demand. growth domestic final demand run something like 5 per cent past year, average rate nearly 6 per 3/7 cent per year past three years. and growth global demand thing australia produce has, past year two, generally strong time past decades. graph 3 click view largerif demand growth strong, hasn’t economy grow faster? have hit capacity

domestic demand, producer may present opportunity sale easy market foreign alternatives. it might reflect rise exchange rate (ie demand rather supply), though export weakness date time exchange rate much lower. so leave us? there hard fast answer, reasonable grind think australian economy operate close full capacity time. we don’t want overstate this: could claim physical limit reach across board

misinterpret remark indicate current account deficit is, per se, something address monetary policy. so i shall state clearly not. actually, whether current account position objective policy obvious -

quality dwell stock owner-occupier enhance flow dwell services, receive cash. these household confident future income would sufficient afford high consumption dwell services, pay form high debt servicing. we can’t know yet whether judgement correct. be rise current account deficit associate this, itself, problem? to ass that, helpful ask two questions: • risks? • run them? in cross-border capital flows, main complication someone bear exchange rate risk. if current account deficit turn problem, usually domestic entity borrow foreign currency unhedged. at point exchange rate falls, leave financial position borrower strain, principal value debt service cost loan high term local currency borrower earn income. but case borrowers’ obligation australian dollars, foreign currency, true intermediary fund loan (and hedge risk). foreign supplier capital are, fact, bear exchange rate risk. so problem here, australian household borrow foreigners, particular, fund investment dwell stock, borrow anyone so. the risk run exchange rate risk, simply future income may high expected, leave hard anticipate 6/7 service australian dollar borrowings. this another way say say number times: position high leverage leaf household vulnerable would otherwise negative shock income. how serious risk ultimately remain seen, degree concern would, view, regardless state current account. in say this, i mindful bear foreign exchange risk might wish change exposure, slow rate accumulate it, one reason other, time other. what would implication change view? it fairly extreme assume would total ‘sudden stop’ capital flow, occur periodically emerge market country operate fix exchange rate become unsustainable. in australia’s experience float exchange rate past two decades, never occurred. even day great concern external account 1980s, substantial capital inflow australia continue - equivalent 3 6 per cent gdp per annum. what occur, occasion, cost foreign capital rose, mainly form decline foreign currency price australian asset - ie fall exchange rate. be concern current account position emerge point future, similar result might expected. have say that, one know adjustment occur, let alone when. but occur, experience past decade suggest would able cope. we absorb substantial exchange rate movements, without economy derailed. so seem rather fret current account deficit per se, sensible focus underlie imbalance economy. the current account outcome may point imbalance - indeed high current account deficit past couple year point house story - behaviour drive imbalance, rather nationality supply funds, issue. conclusion at time year, often tempt think year full unexpected. but thing go, 2004 especially exciting. despite various risks, global economic growth go pretty well. it derail geopolitical uncertainty, sars, financial crisis “global imbalances”. in fact, offer external environment australia seldom bettered. at home, economy turn steady performance. unemployment low year ago, confidence profit high, inflation contained. even growth seemed, official data, little low expected, want demand, suggest focus supply-side improvement - always important - come even fore. the significant imbalance - credit-funded boom purchase house - begin unwind benign fashion one would dare imagine. one hope 2005 turn similarly uneventful, home abroad. no doubt something unexpected come road. in time shall see is. but now, i wish merry christmas, prosperous (and uneventful) new year. 7/7 ardian fullani: bank-business relationship - new chapter speech mr ardian fullani, governor bank albania, meet organise bank albania cooperation business community country, tirana, 13 december 2004. * * * honor participants! i regard today’s meet special opportunity communities, bank one business one, open new communication cooperation, new relationship base reciprocal trust benefit. from naïve viewpoint, seem final goal, price stability country’s financial stability would appear different goal, maximization profit activity exercise. however, go details, would notice community represent hall decision achievement make work easier, towards indisputable idea economic growth could exist without economic-financial stability. it easy make important decision grow business stabilize economic environment inflation rate low. otherwise, would feel insecure, especially concern perspective business. also, case country’s financial stability presence consolidate bank sector, would feel convenient naturally flow free financial fund would address qualitative growth businesses. on hand, fragile financial system, insecure unsupervised segment would increase potential powerful shocks, one way another would affect business also overall savings. below i treat complicate theoretical issues. simultaneously, i would like offer apology make propagandistic declarations. along purpose i introduce recent initiative bank albania viewpoint new vision, i briefly treat awareness community enhance cooperation bank system, include bank albania, institution i govern. i hope recently chance hear debate cash reduction economy, acute need bank system creation important information registers, i also hope share opinion bank system make obvious progress recently. i take advantage opportunity declare right begin propagandistic campaign concrete projects, make bank business useful, naturally overall population large. protection value save constant commitment. allow briefly treat issue i mention above: 1. lend economy last week i meet bank sector directors, discuss development perspective lend economy. it agree much space direction, bank request specific information term economy sectors, investment make project made. of course, information would assist bank process deal requirement time would assist even project future business. view context, i would strongly encourage address bank absorb financial funds. but, time, transparency, clarity need relationship bank business successful. 1/3 2. credit information bureau the establishment credit information bureau program initiate albanian bank association, accomplishment much work institutional coordination need actor interest, business, banks, public institution bank albania. the credit information bureau expect facilitate information problem exist bank businesses, also interbank information much important viewpoint use scale economies. the bank albania facilitate condition accomplishment project. 3. automate electronic clear house system after successful implementation real time gross settlement system, bank albania recently inaugurate initiation implement important project relate automate electronic clear house system. the operation new system lead significant

among others, reach international standard atm po per number population. the challenge bank system businesses, well bank albania, remain public encouragement use them. 4. cash reduction economy some above-mentioned step imply contribute directly indirectly reduction cash economy. but bank albania plan undertake step respect, collaboration important institution like ministry finance, ministry

philipp hildebrand, member govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 16 december 2004. * * * 1. development international financial market look back year go by, become evident two oppose price movement dominate markets: strong depreciation u dollar one hand sharp rise oil price hand. development bond equity market were, comparison, rather restrained. in past weeks, dollar continue downtrend commence three year ago, time greenback still worth chf 1.70. give structurally inflate u current account deficit, sustain downward revision come surprise. however, fact revision date relatively one-sided vis-à-vis european currency canadian dollar problematic. major asian currency either remain completely peg dollar, chinese renminbi, join dollar slide - least extent - like japanese yen. this possible, however, price, namely huge dollar-buying effort part central bank government question. a result asymmetric trend, european exporter currently bear brunt additional competitive pressure stem weak dollar. the swiss export industry understandably especially keen see franc expose revaluation euro. sudden precipitous adjustment exchange rate also undesirable monetary policy perspective. the unrelenting rise oil price surprise many market analysts. since begin 2004, dollar price west texas intermediate crude oil climb 50%. in real terms, however, ascent nearly sharp early oil price shocks. in europe, hike cushion erosion dollar. the reason behind bullish oil price manifold. the main trigger, however, likely structural increase demand come emerge economies, particularly china india. in addition, supply flexibility currently quite weak, investment spend drilling, transportation storage oil somewhat neglect year oil price low. potential geopolitical risk also push prices. last least, raw material - gold traditionally - play ever great role international investors’ asset allocation, also tend generate increase demand. that notwithstanding, influence financial player price oil overestimated. the development long-term future price crude oil indicate price spike primarily trigger sustain increase consumer demand. the price five-year future contract west texas intermediate crude almost double last three years. follow sudden rise last spring, u capital market rate since drop back year-earlier level. the temporary increase capital market rate europe slightly le pronounced. a result oppose movement u european interest rate past weeks, long-term dollar interest rate exceed correspond interest rate euro area approximately 50 basis points. on one hand, general interest rate development capital market reflect market participants’ misgive concern strength economic upswing. on hand, historically low nominal interest rate testimony markets’ confidence ability determination central bank ensure price stability. moreover, interest rate structure u characterise sizeable dollar investment asia. international equity market trend sideways much year, although emerge market index particular able generate significant profits. 2. manage national bank’s asset the national bank manage monetary reserve slightly excess chf 60 billion, two-thirds hold foreign currency investment one-third gold. in addition approximately 25-30 billion swiss franc asset form balance repo transaction 1/2 money market bond investment domestic capital market. the monetary reserve swiss franc asset combine make monetary assets, require monetary policy. in addition assets, national bank also manage proceed sale surplus gold reserves. the portfolio so-called free asset amount slightly chf 20 billion. in management monetary assets, monetary policy objective restriction priority. in compliance primacy monetary policy, investment optimise accord security, liquidity return. important regard concentration liquid investments, word readily marketable investments, great possible risk diversification hold different currency investment categories. the national bank’s leeway investment extend considerably since entry force new national bank act may 2004. risk diversification option particular also increase result. the concrete investment structure different portfolio yield publish quarterly update appendix investment policy guideline swiss national bank. the current investment structure risk/earnings profile national bank’s assets, particular foreign currency reserve free assets, summarise follows: the portfolio adjustment make new act aim increase diversification term currency investment category. within context 2004 strategy, dollar share reduce favour pound sterling yen. the weaken u currency result decrease dollar’s share foreign currency reserves. recently, effort prevent dollar’s share drop low view rebalancing, buy dollar number occasions. furthermore, part 2004 strategy, proportion government bond also reduce favour borrowers’ bonds. the require minimum rat bond investment low a2 bbb, thus cover entire “investment grade” range. corporate bond also add national bank’s investment universe, albeit foreign companies. currently, roughly 4% foreign currency reserve free asset invest corporate bonds. the credit quality investment still high. borrower top rat aaa account 70% investments. close 20% bear aa rating. the remain investment a bbb. the average residual maturity (duration) bond hold national bank keep 4-5 years. the first investment equity issue exclusively foreign company make begin 2005. the addition equity corporate bond likely improve degree diversification investment contribute achievement slightly high return medium term. the main difference investment structure foreign currency reserve free asset currency profile. in case free assets, foreign currency investment diversify also partially hedge exchange rate risks. around half free asset currently expose currency risks. the risk relate national bank’s asset primarily assess monitor use value-at-risk method. moreover, number different stress analysis increasingly carry out. in risk measurement, take account investment horizon, particular monetary reserves, long-term one. where monetary asset concerned, gold price exchange rate risk - notably dollar - play decisive role. interest rate risks, significant right, quite small comparison. the overall risk free asset considerably lower. on whole, credit risk relatively small. the national bank’s investment value daily market prices, thus make possible form up-to-date impression earn situation. owe high degree risk exposure gold price, exchange rate interest rate level, earn situation change dramatically quarter quarter year year. in year alone, quarterly return total asset fluctuate +2.7% -3.2%. so far year, national bank’s asset yield 1.3% overall. give long-term investment horizon, short-term fluctuation generally present problem national bank. the long-run yield great importance. in past five years, national bank achieve average yield 2.9%. this le correspond earn forecast underlie agreement swiss confederation national bank regard distribution profits. 2/2 jean-pierre roth: the swiss national bank’s new inflation forecast introductory remark mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, end-of-year medium news conference, zurich, 16 december 2004. * * * economic growth switzerland lose momentum. for year, however, still anticipate economic growth close 2%. in come year, expect economy expand 1.5% 2%. on assumption three-month libor rate remain unchanged 0.75%, expect annual inflation rate 1.1% 2005 1.3% 2006. le dynamic growth, weak u dollar decline excess liquidity dampen anticipate inflationary pressure somewhat. the target range three-month libor rate therefore leave unchanged 0.25-1.25% rate keep middle range. the national bank’s monetary policy continue expansionary effect. should unexpected development push swiss franc sharply, take appropriate action. allow explain decision. it base outlook price development come three year summarise new inflation forecast. the graph depict current previous inflation forecasts. the dash-dotted green curve reflect september forecast. like current forecast, base assumption three-month libor rate remain unchanged 0.75% follow three years. we see graph (blue line) inflation third quarter year insignificantly high forecast september. the dash red curve represent new forecast. it begin fourth quarter 2004 end third quarter 2007. the new forecast differ previous one three points. firstly, project inflation high third quarter 2005. secondly, inflationary uptrend set half year later. and thirdly, inflationary pressure decrease long term, evidence lower-lying curve. there significant economic fact behind three deviations, i would like comment on. 1. slightly high inflation 2005 the increase anticipate inflation third quarter 2005 predominantly attributable rise oil prices. at september assessment, price brent london stand usd 41. by end october, price surge usd 50 drop back around usd 40. high price oil product main cause rise inflation last months. annual inflation may september hover around 1%. a fresh spurt oil product price october november trigger rise annual inflation 1.3% 1.5% respectively. accord new inflation forecast, annual rate inflation increase 1.5% average first quarter 2005. we presume oil price tend go down. consequently, inflationary pressure subside somewhat, particularly towards end 2005. with unchanged monetary policy, likely see inflation rate 0.9% first quarter 2006. 2. continue recovery in order ass inflation medium term, economic prospect paramount. during phase economic recovery, currently experiencing, rapidly capacity utilisation rate increase important monetary policy perspective. even though gdp growth fourth quarter 2004 likely low project september assessment, expect swiss economy expand close 2% year. the upswing continue next year. we anticipate growth rate 1.5% 2% whole 2005. the fact economy brave oil price hike strong franc testimony robust recovery. there le uncertainty inflation prospect next year. utilisation economic resources, slowly increasing, lead additional pressure price 2005. a glean new inflation forecast, improve capacity utilisation likely impact price development course 2006. 1/3 the current inflation forecast medium term, ie come two years, characterise similar course one chart september. in new forecast, point inflation begin climb postpone half year. if monetary policy remain unchanged, annual inflation 1.1% 2005 1.3% 2006. 3. low inflation long term after discuss medium-term inflation prospects, allow move long-term prospects. the assessment inflation prospect long term depend number factors, development monetary credit aggregate different asset prices. long-term forecast fraught high degree uncertainty. in spite this, central bank must make sound assessment effect monetary policy long term. the need forward-looking stance due fact monetary policy strong effect price lag two three years. m1 5.4% year-earlier level november; m2 approximately 3%. m3 increase 1.4%. although still ample provision liquidity, dwindle result late developments. compare september assessment, therefore make downward correction inflation projection year 2006 2007. accord september forecast - base unchanged three-month libor rate 0.75% - inflation would climb 2.9% second quarter 2007. with unchanged monetary policy, current forecast predict increase 2.3%. at end new forecast horizon third quarter 2007, inflation would stand 2.6%. the low long-term inflation forecast suggest currently room manoeuvre maintain expansionary monetary policy course. 4. exchange rate the dollar plummet since october. it lose 7.9% vis-à-vis swiss franc. notwithstanding sharp fluctuation dollar, franc remain virtually unchanged euro. the depreciation dollar direct impact swiss economy undermine price competitiveness export industries. moreover, weak dollar also exert indirect influence cloud growth prospect europe, large sale market. the appreciation franc tighten monetary conditions. at time, weak dollar dampen effect import price and, consequently, inflation prospects. 5. continuation expansionary monetary policy i come conclude remarks. the inflation forecast show process normalisation monetary policy yet ended. in light comment nevertheless difficult understand decision leave three-month libor rate 0.75%. since inflationary pressure expect ease long term, need take step toward normalisation interest rate point time. in addition, strong franc already result restrictive monetary conditions. with decision keep three-month libor rate hold, adhere current monetary policy course: make use monetary policy leeway support growth without jeopardise long-term price stability. every forecast every decision fraught uncertainty. should unexpected event delay economic recovery push swiss franc sharply, shall take appropriate action. for cases, swiss national bank keep option open. 2/3 observe inflation december 2004 inflation forecast september 2004 libor 0.75% december 2004 libor 0.75% 3/3 michael c bonello: the maltese lira interview mr michael c bonello, governor central bank malta, the malta business weekly, 9 december 2004. * * * i must first point decision regard external value maltese lira take minister finance recommendation central bank malta consent prime minister. decision complex, technical issue far-reaching economic social implication understandably take lightly. they must, reason, make basis fact supposition. have say that, i must make equally clear point time bank cannot responsibly make recommendation sense simple reason conclusive evidence change warranted, still le would deliver expect benefits. nor bank aware anybody else make credible case change value currency. the conclusion bank’s study equilibrium exchange rate share several local foreign experts, include imf mission malta last may. subject caveat equilibrium exchange rate currency cannot estimate precisely, common agreement exchange rate maltese lira appear significantly misalign reason economy’s slow growth lie elsewhere address directly. indeed, i cannot detect economic rationale sudden attention give exchange rate. the export community, sector directly concerned, knowledge make formal proposal foi. it also significant change exchange rate feature among 55 mcesd recommendation restoration competitiveness. devaluation improve competitiveness work. unless accompany cut real wages, serf raise inflation. this bear experience several countries, include malta’s 1992. a concept “gradual depreciation”, clearly defined, near instrument know economic theory crawl peg. since involve change exchange rate regime, require announcement currency depreciate give interval dictate movement anchor, retail price index. this method create uncertainty offer speculator one-way bet. experience indeed show crawl peg regime often end crisis. the lesson recent economic history ignored. change exchange rate resort everything else failed. they measure last resort. besides, produce desire result accompany comprehensive set complementary policy implement control environment. speculate exchange rate without produce conclusive proof root cause economy’s difficulty is, therefore, inappropriate serious repercussions. the national interest require u concentrate rather immediate, well documented, reason economy’s slow growth. i elaborate aspect recent interview carry another local newspaper. 1/1 t t mboweni: the state south african economy remark mr t t mboweni, governor south african reserve bank, annual dinner honour ambassador high commissioner republic south africa, pretoria, 7 december 2004. * * * your excellency, dean diplomatic corp your excellencies, ambassador high commissioner your excellency, chief state protocol your excellencies, head international organisation represent republic south africa deputy governor south african reserve bank senior management south african reserve bank spouses/partners medium representative lady gentleman welcome annual dinner honour ambassador high commissioner accredit republic south africa. my colleague i always look forward bat breath even end every year. this dinner represent u highlight every year gather break bread discus issue common interest relevance various countries. 2004 indeed momentous year global economy. one distinguish feature year oil price. when i join central bank 1998, north sea brent crude oil price $9 per barrel. since then, oil price shoot quite considerably. the price north sea brent crude oil around $38 per barrel indication might come opec target level $22 - $28 per barrel near future. the future price also indicate oil price stay near $40 per barrel level. the behaviour oil price change global economic outlook real way. estimate international monetary fund researcher oil price average $37 per barrel 2004, global growth slow ½ percentage point, inflation advance country increase 0.3 percentage point trade balance advance country deteriorate 0.3 per cent gross domestic product. the estimate south africa economic growth might decline 0.6 percentage point, inflation increase 1.6 percentage point trade balance worsen 1.4 per cent gross domestic product. clearly cause concern all-round. at core oil price development seem concern supply constraints. these arise, part, result supply problem iraq, uncertainty possible tension unite state iran, production uncertainty nigeria, continue problem experience russian government yukos oil company, management trade union tension norway damage production cause hurricane ivan gulf mexico. although development mention significant, would, however, seem u oil market player run ahead term pricing. time again, large producer oil world, kingdom saudi arabia, make know sufficient reserve capacity ensure global supply meet demand. on many occasions, kingdom saudi arabia actually increase supply le million barrel per day. they indicate sufficient reserve next 50 years. and stability return trouble oil-producing country, supply surely guaranteed. it maybe time market pause reflect perceive supply constraints. certainly, global economy expect le oil market. despite risk global economy recent past, substantial global economic growth record 2003 prospect whole 2004 look promising. the global economy record impressive 3.9% growth 2003, unite states, japan, india, china many emerge market economy make impressive contribution global growth. 1/5 growth rate china india remain envy country 2003. although chinese authority attempt slow growth country, growth rate around 9%, country continue amaze. it forecast global growth 2004 likely region 5%, slow somewhat 2005 4,3%. base forecasts, safely say, without fear contradiction, world economy still good state growth. the oil price notwithstanding, global economy show resilient face many constraints. there remain, however, number challenge tackle world economy improve medium long term. at recent g20 meet berlin 20 21 november 2004, challenge global growth summarise follows: “the unite state need urgently address fiscal current account deficit result major negative adjustment part world; latin american country need continue broad base structural reform pursue prudent

heart-warming common global agenda growth begin emerge amongst world’s 20 large economy outside traditional washington consensus. come back development south africa, also please note hard work put policy formulation plan past decade begin bear fruit. i know familiar economic situation south africa i therefore wish highlight key feature recent economic financial developments. statistic sa recently rebased revise economic growth numbers. this acceptable international best practice. the south african reserve bank endorse endeavour. a result extensive exercise, development mention observed. firstly, south african economy large previously thought. previously, level gross domestic product estimate r888 billion (2000), r983 billion (2001), r1 121 trillion (2002) r1 209 trillion (2003). the revise figure show level gdp much high r922 billion (2000), r1 020 trillion (2001), r1 165 trillion (2002) r1 251 trillion (2003). these revision fairly substantial! the statistician general comment “the level revise gdp current price 0.5 3.9 percent high previous estimate period 2/5 1998 2003. the gdp year 2003 3.5% high previously reported”. in summary, mean level economic activity south africa indeed significant. secondly, gdp per caput current price improve significantly base revision one make use late available 2001 population estimates. previously, think gdp per caput r20,3 thousand (2000), r22,1 thousand (2001), r24,5 thousand (2002) r26,2 thousand (2003). the revise figure mean much better-off thought, r21,1 thousand (2000), r22,9 thousand (2001), r25,5 thousand (2002) r27,1 thousand (2003). thirdly, revision confirm observation many people make south african economy. it clear many economy large grow much fast official data stats sa previously suggested. the challenge ahead maintain momentum focus amongst others g20 urge south africa do. of particular importance absolute fully dedicate focus education skill development south africa high growth path. although employment creation still low levels, nonetheless encourage see pick number people employed. accord late official data available march 2004, total employment south africa 11 984 million, mark improvement total 11 652 million september 2003. the number unemployed people remain high south africa despite improvement. accord stats sa, total unemployed 4 611 million march 2004 compare 4 627 million september 2003. so lot work still lie ahead far employment creation concerned. but encourage number people unemployed come down. a indicate past, south africa introduce inflation target year 2000. the inflation target specify consumer price index le mortgage cost, co-called cpix. the numeral target cpix remain average 6 3 percent. now, little change specify target must meet twelve-month continuous basis. we happy central bank report even since september 2003, inside target range. this achievement also begin influence inflation expectation positive way. the expectation business, trade union household well within target levels. this important inflation outcome go forward. in inflation target monetary policy framework, important commit inflation target target intermediate variable. so whilst variable exchange rate, monetary aggregates, unit labour cost oil price play important part inflation process, become intermediate target must however watch carefully systematically central bank. the exchange rate rand determine supply demand development foreign exchange market. the central bank target level exchange rate take rate give forex market. due importance attache exchange rate inflation process, competitively price exchange rate prefer outcome central bank. we neither prefer weak rand overvalue exchange rate. we prefer competitively price exchange rate. from time time, exchange rate tendency over- undershoot market. this case if, instance, global imbalance lead depreciation appreciation significant currency american dollar. indeed current level dollar occasion main large american current account deficit balance payments. for long rest world will finance deficit buy american assets, current account deficit easily finance market seem become somewhat doubtful recently. we share view american dollar collapse. yes, gradual adjustment result current account deficit hope adjustment measure orderly disruptive global currency markets. extreme volatility forex market helpful us. one therefore expect current period near term, rand show strength dollar. but rand alone this. indeed euro, australian dollar, japanese yen many significant currency show sign strengthen american dollar. this expected. 3/5 but central bank lose focus. and indeed never lose focus. we business target inflation intermediate variable. we take advantage current condition forex market purchase significant amount foreign currency market part process build foreign exchange reserves. you might recall 1998 negative net open foreign currency position $23 billion. that difficult time u bank. through carefully plan processes, eliminate negative net open foreign currency position positive $14,4 billion gross gold foreign exchange reserve account. the build reserve see fundamental stability foreign exchange market. we therefore hope see much stable exchange rate go forward. i know stable foreign exchange market also significant importance diplomatic corp bring stability certainty budget processes. we glad eliminate negative nofp could assistance you. the competent macro-economic management, include fiscal monetary discipline, lead country’s improve economic outlook well enhance sound economic fundamentals. international investor recognise progress achieve recent year change sentiment towards south africa. the positive sentiment towards country high level confidence future progress also support numerous rat upgrade major international rat agency last years. these rat support stable transparent macro-economic policy framework; record fiscal prudence result moderate public debt levels; much improve external liquidity position closure forward book. the credit rat continue upward path. currently moody’s review country upgrade, could see south africa’s foreign currency rat move current baa2 (lower investment grade) baa1 (higher investment grade). towards end october 2004 fitch revise outlook south africa’s bbb rat stable positive. inflow south africa’s bond equity markets, largely elusive 2002/2003, witness significant turnaround 2004. fast economic growth combine low inflation environment interest rate multi-decade low see non-residents return equity market. for 2004 date, equity market enjoy inflow value r25,9 billion. while net basis, bond market experience outflows, remain small comparison outflow experience 2003 (-r1,7bn compare -r8,1bn) . in fact, bond market register inflow r3,9 billion november alone, yield domestic government bond continue move fresh low month. these capital inflow reflect low risk perception justify improve credit ratings, clearly indicate high level confidence south africa’s macro-economic future. positive sentiment also reflect spread south africa’s foreign currency denominate bond relation u treasuries. the spread south african sub-index u treasury narrow significantly. for first time since launch, sub-index close 100-basis-points level, ie 94 basis points, 4 november. the improvement support country’s positive credit rat outlook, performance rand sound economic fundamentals. at levels, south africa compare favourably poland, malaysia thailand, whose credit rat upper level investment grade. on 30 november, south african sub-index narrow 92 basis point u treasuries. the spread south africa’s us-dollar denominate bond mature 2009 2012 narrow 102 72 basis point u treasury respectively 14 october 30 november 2004. the 10-year u dollar global bond issue may year similarly tighten 195 basis point u treasury launch may currently around 103 basis points. a rat upgrade moody’s would put south africa scale thailand whose ten-year us-dollar denominate bond spread currently trade around 52 basis point u treasuries. this suggest south africa’s ten-year u dollar denominate bond, currently 85 basis point u treasuries, could rally further. another clear indication south africa’s improve creditworthiness also see increasingly narrow margin pay international syndicate loans. whereas 2001 pay 85 basis point p.a. libor three-year loan, 2003 margin come 67.5 basis point p.a., early year able improve term negotiate margin 47.5 basis point p.a. libor. 4/5 the relation south africa many country rest global village, evidence number embassy high commission station south africa, bear testimony confidence. my colleague senior management staff table hopefully clarify amplify remark i make evening. meanwhile, welcome thank accept invitation annual dinner honour ambassador high commissioner post republic south africa. your friendship take granted, highly valued. thank much. 5/5 jean-pierre roth: international monetary policy 2005 summary speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, 19. internationale zins-forum - zinsen 2005, frankfurt main, 6 december 2004. the complete speech find german swiss national bank’s website (www.snb.ch). * * * the major central bank react lacklustre global economy 2002 relax monetary policy. the low money market rate 2002 2003 appropriate recession. they not, however, indicate sustain global upswing. this several central bank begin steer monetary policy back normal course 2003 2004. the tempo monetary policy normalisation obviously depend progress economic recovery, lead different reaction country. in rather favourable climate, oil price begin soar 2003. however, reason fear repeat dire consequence witness past oil crises. on one hand, rise oil price come time economic environment much stable back then. on hand, strong global economic growth drive oil prices. in order ensure price stability, normalisation economic activity must accompany normalisation interest rate policy. the late oil price hike bear basic premise. the constellation weak growth dynamic high oil price could, however, delay get monetary policy back track. since central bank commit goal price stability, lot depend transmission oil price increase inflation expectations. in industrialise countries, inflation expectation give cause concern time being. low inflation expectation flexible monetary policy concept allow central banker carefully adjust monetary policy 2005, provide seem appropriate business cycle reasons. 1/1 susan schmidt bies: it’s model - recognise importance qualitative factor effective risk-management process remark m susan schmidt bies, member board governor u federal reserve system, international center business information’s risk management 2004 conference, geneva, 7 december 2004. * * * good afternoon. i delight join today. i spend much career field risk management, course federal reserve keen interest topic. for u spend year business, easy see recent progress quantitative scientific aspect risk management bring improve database technological advances. these increase capability open door mind new way measure manage risk. these advance make possible development new market product widely rely upon financial nonfinancial firms, turn help promote adoption best risk measurement management practices. they also make practice risk management far sophisticate complex. these change come good risk-measurement technique potential, i believe, substantially improve efficiency u world financial markets. although importance quantitative aspect risk measurement may quite apparent - least practitioner art - importance qualitative aspect may le so. in practice, though, qualitative aspect le important successful operation business - event continue demonstrate. some qualitative factor - experience judgment - affect one model

risk measurement management process essential effectiveness processes. finally, i want raise issue around account disclosure risk. if single theme remark today, simply this: keep improving, refining,

industry practice without create new framework. the designer intend build straitjacket, policymakers insist characteristic, colleague vice chairman ferguson refer basel ii’s “evergreen” aspect. enterprise-wide risk management within financial institutions, good great focus risk measurement help bridge gap perspective traditional credit risk officer “quant.” this small accomplishment,

asset/liability committee, alco. this committee include old finance committee member new alco staff also, important, add business-line manager responsible major corporate retail bank activities. for first time, price loan deposit move silo business-line management, recognize enterprise whole coordinate balance sheet usage order maintain net interest margin around target level. while enterprise-wide approach market risk evolve vary pace different depository institutions, latter part 1980s basic element place and, 1990s, process matured. the alco process widely recognize critical element management board governance processes. this discipline emerge good asset-liability risk measures, also new risk measurement management technique computer technology facilitate rapid innovation financial instruments. the industry turn new securitization technique pool mortgage remove interest rate risk balance sheets, technique eventually expand loan type well. interest rate derivatives, structure investment securities, callable debt allow financial institution meet customer demand effectively manage liquidity interest rate risk exposure relationship entail. enterprise-wide market-risk management become value-added activity widely accept critical element governance strategic process financial institutions. the example i present effective asset-liability management committee process support business-line strategy well governance, intend illustrate effective enterprise-wide risk-management process build comply regulations, bank regulation sarbanes-oxley requirement unite states. rather, process add value become integral part strategic tactical business-decision processes. corporate strategy often focus “most likely” future scenario benefit strategic initiative. a sound governance, risk-management, internal-control environment start stretch strategic plan exercise consider alternative outcomes. that is, strategy developed, management board consider risk exposure change part plan process. then, appropriate control build process design, cost error rework initial rollout reduced, ongoing initiative successful monitor process signal activity result miss intend goal corrective action initiate promptly. accord global survey governance financial institution conduct pricewaterhousecoopers (and report april), one reason financial institution make grade equate effective governance meet demand regulator 2 bi review 74/2004 legislators, without recognize sound governance also good business.1 in words, tend look another compliance exercise. the study go state compliance mentality limit institutions’ ability achieve strategic advantage governance. i agree institution view corporate governance merely compliance exercise miss mark. over years, corporate manager learn focus good process management quality enhance financial return customer satisfaction. they learn correct errors, downtime critical systems, undertraining staff result high cost lose revenue opportunities. i challenge consider corporate governance structure appropriate bank’s unique business strategy scale important investment, consider return investment term avoidance cost poor internal control customer dissatisfaction. a know, organization get lax approach corporate governance, problem tend follow. we experience regard. some may recall time attention management u bank devote section 112 federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act, first require bank management report internal control auditor attestation early 1990s. then process become routine, delegate low level management unresponsive change way business run. unfortunately, organization weak governance, try change culture meet sarbanes-oxley requirement take exceptional amount senior management directors’ time - time take away build business. the challenge, therefore, achieve proper control environment one point time, also maintain discipline and, indeed, ensure corporate governance keep pace change risk face come years. one weakness see delegation management development assessment internal-control structure risk-management, internal-control, compliance group. it important emphasize line management responsibility identify risk ensure mitigate control effective - leave assessment group independent line organization. manager expect evaluate risk control within scope authority least annually report result process chief risk officer audit committee board directors. an independent group, internal audit, perform separate assessment confirm management’s assessment. credit risk management the evolution portfolio approach credit risk management follow path similar asset-liability management. it begin late 1980s, aftermath serious credit-quality deterioration. model database default credit spread since become sophisticated, loan review committee evolve committee consider broadly various aspect portfolio risk management. a result, loan price good reflect vary level risk, syndicate securitized mitigate lenders’ risk, credit derivative create limit credit-risk exposure retained. on last topic, i would remiss draw attention recent consultative paper credit-risk transfer issue joint forum october. this consultative paper focus credit derivative relate transaction - outgrowth good risk measurement - open public comment january 2005. it document remarkable growth innovation credit products, aggregate notional value $2.3 trillion 1,200 regularly trade reference entity “names.” the paper emphasize much growth likely, product still early phase life cycle, important issue face market participant continue development risk measurement management capabilities. 1 pricewaterhousecoopers economist intelligence unit, “governance: from compliance strategic advantage,” (436 kb pdf) (april 2004). bi review 74/2004 3 in context, consultative paper respond three questions: whether transaction accomplish clean transfer risk, whether participant understand risk involved, whether undue concentration risk developing. overall, paper offer seventeen specific recommendation improve practice supervisory oversight credit risk transfer activity, draw heavily discussion sophisticate market participants. i encourage review paper consider recommendation seriously. let discus two briefly. one recommendation firm understand fully apply discipline credit model order ensure quality manage usage model appropriately. correlation assumption receive special attention here, include grow presence “correlation trade desks” observation several market participant may much commonality assumption across market participants. insufficient diversity view could lead kind turmoil occur market longer-term treasury instrument mid-2003. in case, unexpected increase rate lead large number similarly position financial institution seek take side transaction simultaneously. another recommendation participant properly understand economic mean external rat apply credit risk transfer instruments, especially collateralize debt obligation cdos - compare rat give traditional obligations. identical rat across different type instrument guarantee identical risk characteristics, particular may imply equal probability loss event unequal severity loss. it important understand specific methodology use rat agency - agency make available extensive detail, include default correlation address - structure specific transaction order properly ass contribution portfolio’s risk profile. data integrity, broadly define even best process suffer data use measure risk performance flawed. in understand driver good risk management, qualitative factor critical influence reliability characteristic “data” use evaluate risk performance. in broad sense, “data integrity” refer consistency, accuracy appropriateness information data base model, also process produce utilize measures. use way, “data integrity” include quality credit files, track key customer characteristics, internal process controls, even train support all. when one say “data integrity” risk-management circle days, people think qualify standard internal-ratings-based approach credit risk capital basel ii. i think broad concept, let spend moment subject. the propose timetable u implementation basel ii reflect requirement rulemaking process need bank supervisor prepare introduction new standards. a probably know, u bank agency envision formal release propose regulation mid-2005, parallel run basel i basel ii 2007 full implementation 2008. even timetable, regulatory community recognize substantial data limitation may prevent bank develop viable robust parameter estimate near term - even probability default cases. for reason, bank supervisor wait data accumulate bank estimate validate parameter input reliable, robust manner. in interim, bank supervisor rely heavily qualitative validation approach - although entirely. supervisor across country work together address validation issues, and, i believe, develop useful guideline bank supervisor alike. in early years, weight may need place qualitative review bank’s internal policy procedures, include internal validation documentation. but expect that, soon implementation, bank ability generate need parameter actual data, supervisor want see positive step take bank organization develop good database provide sort data integrity i discussing. qualitative quantitative benchmarking studies, compare methodology parameter estimate across banks, important tool validation encourage diffusion best practice throughout industry initial, qualitative late quantitative, intervals. but, i noted, high-quality data important strong risk management, basel ii. data need model risk measure use financial services, include credit score models, market-based measure kmv, value-at-risk economic capital 4 bi review 74/2004 models. a know, economic capital model key element pillar 2. the broad concept data integrity also apply development maintenance well-controlled process include measure risk performance. if environment model operate appropriate - institution consider internal control checklist - risk measure provide performance hope achieve. accounting, disclosure, market discipline strong risk measurement discipline maintenance data also improve communication institution investor counterparties. this sense data integrity relate well information provide parties. i would like, now, turn recent account issue surround complex instrument role financial disclosure promote risk management. some may experience earn volatility result use credit derivatives. under u generally accept account principles, credit derivative generally require recognize asset liability measure fair value, gain loss result change fair value must record earnings. most credit derivative qualify hedge account treatment, imply great earn volatility hedge portfolio security carry historic cost bank book. a bank supervisor, i concern account treatment discourage use new risk-management financial instruments. you may wonder answer volatility issue fair value accounting. if hedge asset measure fair value, change value hedge item credit derivative would offset other, reduce volatility arise derivative mark market, depend course effectiveness hedge. but volatility likely remain, since lack close correlation prevent hedge account treatment. the iasb develop new “fair value option” international account standard (ias) 39, firm could mark market credit derivative hedge position report change fair value current earnings. while first glance fair value option might view solution address problem current account model, also raise number concerns. without observable market price sound valuation approaches, fair value measurement difficult determine, verify, audit. report would become le comparable across institutions. moreover, entity’s creditworthiness deteriorate significantly, potentially peculiar result. in circumstance, financial liability would mark fair value gain would record entity’s profit loss statement. in dramatic case, insolvent entity might appear solvent result mark market deteriorate credit risk. many concerns, well recommendation address them, include july comment letter iasb basel committee.2 a heavy user customer investor corporate financial statements, banker also consider fair value measure may mask underlie reason change fair value. a institution use iasb standard consider use fair value option financial report purposes, aware certain relate complexities. for example, loan report use fair value option, change fair value would presumably affect loan loss allowance thus regulatory capital, important asset-quality measure like nonperforming assets, even net interest margins. one area improve disclosure bank organization need involve credit risk allowance loan losses. a know, high degree management judgment involve estimate loan-loss allowance, estimate significant impact institution’s balance sheet earnings. expand disclosure area would improve market participants’ understand institution’s risk profile whether firm adequately provide estimate credit loss consistent, well-disciplined manner. accordingly, i strongly encourage institution provide additional disclosure area. example include breakdown credit exposure internal credit grade, allowance estimate break key components, more-thorough discussion allowance component change period period, 2 a copy letter, date july 30, 2004, find www.bis.org/bcbs/commentletters/iasb14.pdf (59 kb pdf). bi review 74/2004 5 enhance discussion rationale behind change more-subjective allowance estimates, include unallocated amounts. thus, user preparers financial statements, banker encourage transparency account disclosure risk positions. conclusion in remark today, i seek encourage continue effort support evolution risk measurement risk management practice heighten degree professionalism every effective risk manager demonstrate. i want leave remind become catch late technical development lose sight qualitative aspect responsibilities. model alone guarantee effective risk-management process. you encourage continuous improvement aspects, include data integrity, legal clarity, transparent disclosures, internal controls. for risk manager conference, i hope message hear actively engage manager throughout organization, talk merit consistent, sound enterprise-wide risk management culture. in so, help manager see risk-management process allow good understand inherent risk activity turn effectively mitigate risk achieve profit goals. 6 bi review 74/2004 caleb m fundanga: the role operation bank zambia close remark dr caleb m fundanga, governor bank zambia, end bank zambia lecture series member university zambia business economics association (unzabeca), lusaka, 24 november 2004. * * * chairperson bank zambia director member unzabeca distinguish lady gentleman a come end series lecture present bank zambia, sincere hope unzabeca member gain good understand appreciation central banking, general, role operation bank zambia, particular. lady gentlemen, amply explain course lecture series, i would also like reiterate central bank play critical role monetary financial operation country. through lectures, learn primary responsibility central bank includes, among others: • issuance currency; • act banker government; • banker commercial banks; • management country’s foreign exchange reserves; • lender last resort; • management public debt. although central bank carry responsibilities; • collection interpretation statistics, particular, financial monetary statistics; • implementation monetary financial system policies. through lecture series, successfully end today, highlight central bank, like rest economy, adapt change market environment. in case bank zambia, prior 1991, bank numerous roles, include promotion economic growth provision credit critical sector agriculture, manufacturing, mining, etc, well issuance export guarantee exporters. a expected, multiplicity function lead conflict interest. for instance, one hand, bank expect control growth money supply while, hand, require inject money system provision credit select sectors. the introduction economic reform government begin end 1991 therefore bring enormous challenge bank zambia. to meet new challenges, bank’s operation need focused. in respect, bank zambia act amend 1996 reflect change nature operate environment. by amend act, bank’s primary role solely “to formulate implement monetary supervisory policy ensure maintenance price financial system stability”. this deliberate, experience world-over show achieve sustain high economic growth economic environment characterise low stable inflation. thus, work ensure price stability well maintenance safe, sound efficient financial sector, bank contribute achievement sustainable economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction. in nutshell, follow amendment bank zambia act 1996, bank’s main responsibility comprise price financial system stability. the bank ensure financial system stability licensing, supervise regulate activity bank non-bank financial institution promote safe, sound efficient operation development financial system. bi review 74/2004 1 lady gentlemen, i trust that, member unzabeca, actively participate series lecture expand knowledge function bank zambia. on part bank zambia, strongly encourage investment education, demonstrate sponsorship lectures. in regard, i wish take opportunity call upon institution support university either sponsor series lectures, like bank zambia done, render financial assistance. a many may aware, company zambia benefited, one way other, service offer universities. a bank zambia, management member staff, include myself, graduate university member unzabeca. therefore, token appreciation unzabeca, make generous donation sum k9.5 million. this donation, i hope, go long way support unzabeca programmes. however, may i caution manage fund prudently ensure apply towards attainment intend unzabeca objectives. please, wasteful unzabeca coffer liquid! in conclusion, patron unzabeca, i look forward involve unzabeca activities. in regard, i undertake promote activities, slight opportunity, institutions, would benefit services. with remarks, honour privilege declare bank zambia unzabeca lecture series officially closed. i thank you. 2 bi review 74/2004 r basant roi: monetary policy objective mauritius operational framework since 1994 address mr rameswurlall basant roi, gcsk, governor bank mauritius, bank mauritius’ annual dinner major economic stakeholders, flic-en-flac, 3 december 2004. * * * honourable chief justice distinguish guest lady gentleman good even i please welcome bank mauritius annual dinner. in last six address i deal mostly regulatory supervisory issue business community public large need aware of. the address purport enhance transparency bank’s policy decision-making. the theme address even is: a perspective monetary policy objective evolution operational framework since 1994 exchange control act suspended. let start remark - remark generally valid. often, commentator make observation framed, either unwittingly intentionally, lend impression monetary policy, own, capable achieve economic objective time time. this indeed unrealistic demand monetary policy. monetary policy, though important arm macro-economic policy, one several element economic panorama. we need realistic appreciation monetary policy policy field reasonably expect deliver. it’s fact life cannot want time, time circumstances. whether it’s monetary policy, fiscal policy social policy, choice make conflict potentially conflict objective short term. between choice make short term choice available long run economist call long run opportunity cost. policy choice make today often constrain range choice available long run. those u outside economics profession even economics profession frequently tend overlook long run opportunity cost suit them. whenever expectation particular sector met, emerge press demand intervene set right sectoral problem dismiss long run adverse implication intervention economy whole. in dynamic society ever change priorities, relative importance single objective vary time. a switch one policy another demand particular economic sector unrealistic expectation best serve exclusive interest likely cause unintended damage long term objectives. high level employment desire policy objective. but simultaneously want low stable inflation rate. consumer protection warrant way investor protection warranted. but also want free-market competition. the rupee depreciates. exporter silently happy. consumer not. the rupee appreciates. exporter angry. consumer silent. and go story interest rate changes. we “expectations gaps” time. there “trade offs”. however, policy maker constantly strive strike right balance compete ends. sound mind people cannot reasonably expect conflict objective meet time. if bank mauritius meet everybody’s expectations, policy would swing, quite often violently, one extreme other. the end result would much le success achievement longer-term objective. prior 1980s, monetary policy precisely define role overwhelm majority country across world. monetary policy expect achieve number objectives: price stability, balance payment equilibrium, promotion economic growth full employment. these objective conflict short term. with one major policy instrument, central bank expect achieve conflict objective simultaneously. a priority change follow pressure politicians, industry commerce, monetary policy shift leg one other, frequently short intervals. the monetary policy stance central bank swing one extreme bi review 74/2004 1 give rise business cycle high high inflation rate also high high unemployment level - excellent way share misery create solid wealth. central banker become increasingly disappointed. what central bank systematically aim finally achieve ultimate goal growth high employment levels? academic central banker debate question. researcher emphasize monetary nature inflation. last price stability come accept necessary condition sustain growth high employment levels. country experience support perception. those country history low stable inflation also perform well term growth employment. over years, last price stability policy goal central bank broad-based support. monetary policy come assign specific objective achieve sustain price stability. rather pursue different policy stance depend exigency day meet expectation different pressure groups, best consistently pursue policy precisely define objective best serve society whole medium long-term. there general tendency believe bank mauritius concern growth employment. this mis-perception. the bank insensitive unemployed. indeed, bank take account consideration policy-making, short term medium long-term view. monetary policy directly promote growth help create employment; indirectly achievement sustain price stability. durable growth achieved, inter alia, within framework monetary stability. this central bank reasonably expect deliver. in bank mauritius act 2004 expect bank. there however several underlie fundamentally important assumption monetary policy succeed. rather enumerate assumptions, let set question leave reflections. be serious imperfection determination price good service domestic market? why price good service positively respond direction movement exchange rate rupee? how rational consumer make decisions? be labour market flexible? how many traders, producers, exporter importer reliable annual balance sheet basis bank make decision lend? have financial market attain level development facilitate transmission monetary policy impulse readily? year ago le national save investment. today flush fund investment sluggish despite panoply investment incentives. indeed, national save exceed investment far. haven’t overstretch “welfare state” long time point suppress entrepreneurial instinct, blunt creativity, inventiveness, undermine work effort? hasn’t “welfare state” overstretch point give rise society free riders? the free rider “welfare state” heavy burden government finance difficult task monetary policy achieve desire objective. the point i want make monetary policy operate vacuum, independent host critical factors, alone cannot perform miracles. deprive number ally factors, achievement monetary policy objective ultimately durable growth could render difficult. last price stability is, i state earlier, necessary condition sufficient condition growth employment. a number catalytic factor imperatively accompany monetary policy succeed. along change aim monetary policy last fifteen years, operational framework conduct monetary policy undergo several stage evolution across world. here, mauritius, since 1994 operational framework conduct monetary policy base monetary programming, broad money intermediate target inflation final target time horizon 18 month run basis. the first monetary policy committee chairmanship minister finance establish 1994. the monetary program exercise ought produce desire results. the snag - critical one indeed - issue independence bank regard interest rate policy decisions. notwithstanding snag, first operational framework indirect monetary control least set. in 1996 monetary program give different twist. in essence, exercise objective. the framework change form substance. the first top-down second bottom - approach operate balance sheet bank mauritius. in follow two half years, bank helm ship could control storm reason i suspect may already aware of. 2 bi review 74/2004 the bank power pursue realistic interest rate policy not. even bank decide change interest rate policy, would take several week meaningful impact interest rate structure system. the bank rate, predecessor lombard rate, use determine market weekly auction treasury bill since 1994. the bank rate move weekly like flotsam jetsam without signal definite direction market. this system determine bank rate anathema financial system small highly open economy pass post financial liberalization. despite liberalization exchange control, definition allow free movement capital, “flotsam-jetsam” bank rate retained. towards end 1998, systematic pursuit realistic interest rate policy along imaginative well-crafted strategy, is, sale treasury bill over-the-counter individual re-established number equation system. this strategy remedied extent inadequacy money market. in 1999, operational framework reviewed. this framework encapsulate repurchase operation bank mauritius commercial bank along concept key interest rate, lombard rate signal interest rate policy decisions. admittedly, connection lombard rate money market sufficiently strong. this concept key rate wrong money market attain desire level development sophistication. the link lombard rate money market robust shift interest rate policy stance instantly transmitted. however, may observed, change lombard rate intend impact interest rate structure. in time come operational framework conduct monetary policy refine progress development money market. depend pace development money market 2005, lombard rate replace repurchase rate, commonly refer repo rate. a aside, let say monetary policy make never never purely mechanical process; basically interpretative therefore judgemental process require battery information collect every available source, include on-site inspection bank carry bank supervision department. the judgemental process make monetary policy decision-making difficult. i need overstate judgemental susceptible mis-judgements. the bank, however, best avoid err wrong side. it sound simple. but isn’t. central banker endeavour clear view monetary policy transmission mechanism. our policy decision involve good understand role short-term interest rates, exchange rate, money credit economy. the bank heavily count dependable inflation forecasts. a fan chart probabilistic outcome inflation front, duly support highly reliable inflation forecast model play decisive role policy-making process. this key element since monetary policy framework necessarily forward-looking. academic central banker agree thing like “ideal” rate inflation. the specificity economy couple weak predictable relationship certain key monetary economic variable make target specific inflation rate easy stage. i suspect must aware saying: “to sure hit target, shoot first call whatever hit target.” price stability continue give central importance keep clearly sight anchor monetary policy. precisely, bank mauritius act 2004 expect u deliver. much progress make recent past achievement price stability. wide fluctuation rate inflation drastically reduce time. inflation rate 1980s reach peak 44 per cent low le 1 per cent. in 1990s, attain high 14 per cent low 3 per cent. in last 5 year high rate 7 per cent introduction vat couple increase vat rate low 4 per cent. these figure headline inflation rate publish central statistical office(cso). it capture change cost live base typical household consumption basket. central bank go deep statistical analysis inflation. for quite year come concept core inflation - indicator underlie movement consumer prices. core inflation iron effect temporary disturbance shock price attributable economic monetary policy. for instance, impact current increase world price oil inflation rate disturbance monetary policy responsible. that part inflation due disturbance shock statistically isolate headline inflation rate. the resultant rate inflation provide measure indicator underlie long-term inflation. we carry exercise mauritius. we difficulty arrive bi review 74/2004 3 specific core inflation rate mauritius price around one-third item consumption basket set government. have use two different methods, obtain range core inflation. for 12-month period end september 2004, core inflation range 2.9 per cent 3.3 per cent low headline inflation rate 4.1 per cent publish cso. on average, core inflation likely 1 1.5 percentage point headline inflation rate. we expect core inflation current fiscal year region 4 per cent. i may say make considerable headway achieve price stability recent years. the operational framework conduct monetary policy combine increase degree transparency lead high level appreciation market policy decision bank. this clearly aid expectation building. in past central banker believe unanticipated change policy effective. contrary perception, experience demonstrate policy induce shock rather harm economic agent help sharpen effectiveness policy. central banker thus adopt stand – much palpable - allow market player formulate view anticipate likely policy moves. we grow evidence phenomenon mauritius last years. let use anecdote express i mean. in 19th century lead newspaper france announce death famous ail french author. the author, upon hear news death, said, “eh! i start live again.” a week late author actually died. the day after, newspaper come headline: “we first announce death author.” we observe capability emerge among market player commentators. and augur well stability financial industry. lady gentlemen, strong weakness mankind fall mutual animosities, fanciful artefact sufficient excite unfriendly passions. let conclude two observations: first profit bank industry. in type economic system profit make regard sin. bank make fat profits. but bank also take high risk. bank also make fat provision debt go bad. bank also need build reserve strengthen balance sheets. strong sound balance sheet make strong banks. the rate growth pre-tax profit commercial bank observe low growth rate total assets. moreover, last ten year profit bank industry grow rate nominal growth rate economy. my second observation relate idiosyncratic view commercial bank mauritius operate cartel. no; simply bark wrong tree, different forest altogether. it’s view distil badly, blend poorly, bottle upside-down. deposit lend rate vary bank bank. fees, charge commission also vary bank bank. this see on-site inspection banks. now, let assume moment that, instance, rate interest offer deposit banks. should necessarily see evidence collusion among banks? even elementary economics textbook theory competition teach u inter-play force competitive market drive price good service level. over time one price product prevail throughout market necessarily monopolistic situation competition within industry. the contention commercial bank operate cartel simply rate apply make commonsense. and mr. sneer-well said: “i go picture next tuesday and take front seat back i say lady behind i cannot see hat.” seat armchair, i cannot feel fire competition underneath. lady gentlemen, behalf board director staff bank mauritius behalf i wish family merry xmas happy new year. thank you. 4 bi review 74/2004 jean-claude trichet: the integration single market financial service - eurosystem perspective keynote speech mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, cesr conference “europe’s single market financial services: construction fully integrated”, paris, 6 december 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, it great pleasure first committee european security regulators’ (cesr) conference distinguish audience. this certainly right place address common objective fully develop “european single market”. the process financial integration challenge complex endeavour result effective interplay public private action. public authorities, national european, play important role ensure basic condition place market participant expand cross-border activities. these condition include adequate framework regulation, supervision financial stability. whereas public action necessary, concrete realisation financial integration rest eventually initiative market participant exploit opportunity offer institutional framework. in context, assert significant progress achieve pursuit financial integration europe far final goal single financial market fully achieve yet: on side market participant fully fledge pan-european dimension market activity remain achieved. on side public authority basic component institutional framework already place, need time fully produce desirable results. i would like focus contribution integration european security markets, emphasise priority public action eurosystem perspective. the interest eurosystem integration security market the eurosystem clear interest integration security markets. first all, efficient well-integrated financial system crucial smooth transmission monetary policy euro area. security market particularly relevant area, since eurosystem’s monetary policy operation need fully collateralised. the harmonisation national law practice field security - one important element integration security market - enhance effectiveness eurosystem’s collateral policy. second, eurosystem’s monetary policy operation also rely heavily smooth delivery securities. security settlement system ensure smooth delivery national level cross-border basis. at time, safety soundness security clear settlement system equally important central bank perspective. in regard, i want mention recently publish standard security clear settlement systems, jointly develop escb cesr. these standard provide benchmark regulators, supervisor overseer adapt practice commonly accept approach field security settlement. i would recall standard base current market situation legal framework, harmonise eu level. should directive clear settlement finally adopt eu level, clear standard would assess conformity provision directive and, necessary, amend accordingly. third, eurosystem’s interest also stem relationship integration security market financial stability. central bank natural role area, confirm treaty, state eurosystem contribute smooth conduct policy relate stability financial system. an important task eurosystem respect systematic monitor source vulnerability euro area financial system assessment degree resilience potential shocks. in context, i would like announce ecb start publish output activity form financial stability review, first issue already schedule publish 15 december. another task ecb area provision bi review 74/2004 1 advice draft community national legislation financial field either formal opinion participation relevant regulatory (level 2) supervisory (level 3) committees. in particular, ecb follow closely work european security committee (esc) cesr play important role assist commission shape regulatory framework security field. priority area financial regulation supervision the level integration security markets, include market infrastructure trade post-trading areas, increase significantly since introduction euro. give substantive progress, important integrate market develop basis sound framework financial regulation supervision. the cesr crucial role play regard. first, completion financial service action plan (fsap) provide “single european security market” strong impetus. it however important note fsap directive security field design line lamfalussy framework. let mention context market abuse directive, prospectus directive, transparency directive directive market financial instruments. these directive warrant adoption number level 2 implement measure commission full implementation. the preparation technical advice good quality content level 2 rule one cesr’s main achievement date, also tight deadlines. in respect, message i would like convey cesr strive continue good practice provide timely good quality technical advice extensive consultation practices. the recommendation inter-institutional monitor group context supported. for instance, recently request commission, instead general contribution, cesr could formulate advice close possible content level 2 measure. this facilitate increase transparency lamfalussy regulatory process. a regard level 2, i would consider effort optimise content component lamfalussy framework critical importance. in particular, distinction level 1 level 2 legislation, due consideration applicable legislative procedures, could good refined. the aim would achieve flexible consistent set security regulation among member states, enhance cross-border transactions. the good experience gain far implementation lamfalussy approach allow wide scope level 2 case. second, fact integration progress security field segment financial sector, make issue effectiveness supervisory convergence particularly relevant. this imply level 3 need develop regard supervision security markets. the cesr provide contribution field promote strategic reflection key challenge surround supervisory convergence. i refer recently publish report cesr, commonly call “himalaya report”. i understand reflection mirror fact that, comparison level 3 committees, cesr already gain experience position start develop strategic consideration future role. on issue, i would like emphasise conviction soundness potential lamfalussy framework. this framework provide appropriate institutional set-up achieve flexible regulatory process consistent supervision integrate financial markets. this conviction substantially reinforce good experience gain far security field. therefore, i confidence extension lamfalussy framework bank insurance sector reveal positive experience. look ahead, i believe one main objective context commonly refer “the post-fsap strategy” attempt exploit maximum possible extent potential inherent lamfalussy framework improve regulatory supervisory process. this one main challenge level 3 committee also one main factor success committee measured. i aware level 3 committee already work hard meet challenge pose lamfalussy process. therefore, i full agreement conclusion cesr himalaya report experience far success right path. the priority indeed implement exist 2 bi review 74/2004 potential supervisory tool within fsap lamfalussy frameworks. and objective achieve good co-ordination among authority implementation enforcement security regulation across eu. in respect, acknowledge limitation voluntary nature level 3, i would tend think certain “soft” tools, already use cesr, may enhance prospect co-ordination among authorities. first all, increase transparency cesr’s activities, include consultation report practices, may also enhance view cesr’s accountability. second, tool peer pressure supervisory disclosure may provide appropriate incentive coordinate effort among authority without change nature level 3 committees. in respect, i would happy hear concrete detail cesr’s proposal mediation mechanism advisory nature among national regulators. this potential enhance dialogue among cesr member specific supervisory issues, therefore also enhance co-ordination mutual understanding. this good example instrument exploit maximum extent opportunity offer lamfalussy framework. priority area financial stability after address regulation supervision, let turn third component public policy framework financial markets: financial stability. indeed, process pursue financial integration also need accompany strengthen framework maintain financial stability. the emergence pan-european bank group grow integration financial market market infrastructure increase potential scope systemic risk eu. systemic disturbance likely confine one member state, thus cross-border contagion may spread easily. many initiative take eu national level reinforce set-up maintain financial stability manage financial crisis. first, monitor stability financial system developed. more central bank develop systematic monitor stability domestic financial systems. this reflect also task eurosystem which, i already mentioned, establish systematic monitor stability euro area financial system. this analysis include relevant component financial system, notably banks, non-bank financial institutions, financial market financial infrastructure review possible source vulnerability system. this activity eurosystem benefit monitor bank stability eu conduct since long bank supervision committee, one escb committee central bank supervisory agency represented. in connection, i acknowledge level 3 committee insurance field, ceiops, recently activate systematic monitor stability insurance sector eu much along line bsc work. i would thus see merit involvement cesr area develop systematic monitor development financial market financial stability angle. second, additional measure consider strengthen effectiveness supervisory action integrate financial market. for bank sector let mention revise eu capital requirement framework bank investment firm enhance responsibility attribute consolidate supervisor. indeed, along responsibility hold accountable approval sophisticate approach calculate capital requirement group whole, consolidate supervisor also responsible coordinate activity exchange relevant information crisis situations. hence, view, role consolidate supervisor undermine rather underpin crucial need reinforce supervisory cooperation strengthen interplay home host supervisor supervision group operate cross-border basis. strengthen co-operation critical effective prudential supervision financial institutions. a security supervision - main domain cesr - i recognise main challenge relate fact principle home country control find narrow application security commission different power across countries. third, area financial crisis management, main initiative form promote multilateral bilateral agreement among relevant authority prepare case financial crisis cross-border dimension. the main idea behind agreement rely assumption management financial crisis cross-border dimension complex bi review 74/2004 3 endeavour require clear ex-ante understand role procedural step authority involved. such agreement expect useful tool help certain extent management crisis, happen, though recognise crisis unique feature therefore impossible foresee dynamics. in context, i mention mou agree 2003 eu central bank bank supervisor co-operation exchange information crisis situations. the mou - prepare bsc - define general principle co-operation use basis specific agreement amongst authorities. more recently, ecofin agree another agreement reach eu level central banks, bank supervisor finance ministry interplay among three authority crisis situations. at certain stage, i think, issue address would also involve category supervisors, particular security insurance supervisors, give crisis cross-border dimension may well cover also financial institution fall within competence. conclusion lady gentlemen, let finish reiterate “european single market” still construction. notwithstanding significant progress achieve far, attainment optimal level integration require effective interplay market forces, collective action public action. nevertheless, exclusive essential responsibility public authority remain establishment appropriate legislative regulatory framework. regulatory supervisory convergence represent main element process. indeed, convergence effective produce intend benefit cesr member market participant fully rely consistent set practice across eu. this constitute pre-condition – present far - workable mutual recognition among authority expansion cross-border activity market players. thank much attention. 4 bi review 74/2004 ben s bernanke: the

federal reserve system’s website. * * * when i speak monetary policy occasion like one, often focus remark recent policy action near-term outlook. however, good tactic useful insofar serve large strategic purpose, individual policy decision best understand context encompass policy framework. today i would like step back bite current policy concern address broad topic logical framework within monetary policy made. specifically, i introduce briefly discus two compete framework make monetary-policy decisions, vigorous proponent among lead monetary economists, i relate framework policy practice federal reserve. in latter portion remark i argue choice policy framework important practical implications, notably communication policy central bank. before proceed further, i say view i express today necessarily share colleague federal reserve system.1car driver: mislead analogy eight time year federal open market committee (fomc) meet set u.s. monetary policy - which, current operate procedures, amount choose target federal fund rate, short-term interest rate federal reserve influence control supply bank reserves. what logical framework guide decisions? superficially, fomc decision process may appear straightforward. a commonly use analogy take u.s. economy automobile, fomc driver, monetary policy action tap accelerator brake. accord analogy, economy run slowly (say, unemployment high growth potential rate), fomc increase pressure accelerator low target federal fund rate, thereby stimulate aggregate spend economic activity. when economy run quickly (say, inflation appear likely rise), fomc switch brake raise fund rate target, thereby depress spend cool economy. what could simple that?2i wish easy. unfortunately, simplistic view monetary policymaking derive automobile analogy seriously misleading, least two reasons. first, policymakers work keep economy go road must deal informational constraint far severe face real-world drivers. despite best effort statistical agency data collectors, economic data provide incomplete coverage economic activity, subject substantial sample error, become available lag. determine even economy’s current “speed,” consequently, easy, see fact economists’ estimate nation’s gross domestic product (gdp) current quarter may vary widely. forecast economy’s performance quarter ahead even difficult, reflect problem economic measurement effect unanticipated shock also complex constantly change nature economy itself. policymakers unable predict great confidence even (or quickly) action likely affect economy. in short, make monetary policy like drive car, car one 1 i thank number colleague provide constructive comment early draft. 2 one complication easily capture automobile analogy arise fed’s objective price stability maximum sustainable employment come potential conflict, sometimes occur short period (for example, follow aggregate supply shock). in case choice whether slow speed economy straightforward depend variety considerations, stability inflation expectation credibility central bank. this issue central point i wish make today i discus further. bi review 73/2004 1 unreliable speedometer, foggy windshield, tendency respond unpredictably delay accelerator brake. the second problem automobile analogy arise central role private-sector expectation determine impact monetary policy actions. if automobile analogy valid, current set federal fund rate would summarize degree monetary stimulus apply economy, pressure driver exert accelerator particular moment determine whether automobile speed slow down. however, fact, current level federal fund rate best partial indicator degree monetary ease restraint. the current fund rate imperfectly measure policy stimulus important economic decisions, family’s decision buy new home firm’s decision acquire new capital goods, depend much longer-term interest rates, mortgage rate corporate bond rates, federal fund rate. long-term rates, turn, depend primarily current fund rate financial market participant expect fund rate short-term rate evolve time. for example, financial market participant anticipate future short-term rate relatively high, usually bid long-term yield well; long-term yield rise, investor would expect earn high return roll short-term investment consequently would decline hold exist supply long-term bonds. likewise, market participant expect future short-term rate low, long-term yield also tend low, else equal. monetary policy maker affect private-sector expectation action statements, need think thing significantly complicate policymakers’ task (bernanke, 2004). in short, economy like car, car whose speed particular moment depend pressure accelerator moment rather expect average pressure accelerator rest trip - vehicle inexperienced drivers, i think. i hope short discussion convince make effective monetary policy sunday drive park. with informational limitation face policymakers role private-sector expectation mind, i turn next discussion two alternative framework think monetary policy. make monetary policy: two candidate framework the two framework monetary policymaking i compare today generally refer recent economics literature instrument rule target rule (svensson, 2003; mccallum nelson, 2004; svensson, 2004b). unfortunately, purpose least, terminology somewhat misleading. first, term “rule” suggest rigid mechanistic policy prescription leaf room discretion judgment. however, argument monetary policy adhere mechanically strict rule, make economist past, fall favor recent years. today monetary economist use term “rule” loosely describe general policy strategy, one may include substantial scope policymaker discretion judgment. here i use term “policy” instead “rule” avoid connotation latter. second, term “instrument” “targeting” product intellectual history debate and, mind, particularly descriptive. i refer approach know literature instrument rule target rule instead simple feedback policy forecast-based policies, respectively. i hope benefit great descriptive accuracy outweigh cost arise terminological confusion. how two policy approach differ, underlie rationales? under simple feedback policy, central bank’s policy instrument - federal fund rate unite state - closely link behavior relatively small number macroeconomic variables, variable either directly observable (such employment inflation) estimate current information (such economy’s full-employment level output). i exclude definition simple feedback policy policy link policy instrument forecast macroeconomic variables, output inflation; hybrid policy type raise difficult issue would take far afield today.3 generally, macroeconomic variable drive simple feedback policy 3 svensson (2001) present argument use feedback policy base forecasts. mccallum nelson (2004) svensson (2004b) debate issue. 2 bi review 73/2004 choose reflect central bank’s objectives, policymakers direct adjust short-term interest rate (or policy instrument) need offset deviation variable desire levels. that is, current macroeconomic condition “feed back” set short-term rate. the adjective “simple” refer presumption that, regime, policymakers respond relatively short list economic variables. however, i already mentioned, contemporary advocate simple feedback policy generally recommend apply policy flexibly, subject modification special circumstance judgment dictates. a classic example simple feedback policy famous taylor rule (taylor, 1993). in basic version taylor rule equation relate current set federal fund rate two variables: level output gap (the deviation output full-employment level) difference inflation rate policy committee’s prefer inflation rate. like feedback policies, taylor rule instruct policymakers “lean wind”; example, output potential inflation target, taylor rule imply federal fund rate set average level, (all else equal) slow economy bring output inflation back toward desire range.4 numerous simple feedback policy base taylor rule propose analyzed.5how use simple feedback policy address issue i raise early - namely, problem limit information need account private-sector expectation make policy? with respect informational constraints, advocate argue policy type, judiciously chosen, likely give reasonably good result even policymakers’ knowledge economy underlie structure severely limited. the principal evidence claim come computer simulation mathematical model economy. specifically, researcher attempt identify particular simple feedback policy lead good economic outcome apply range alternative economic model (mccallum, 1988; taylor, 1999; orphanides williams, 2002; levin williams, 2003). a turn out, simple feedback policy produce good result variety simulate economic environment - so-called robust policy - often found. proponent simple feedback policy argue that, far certain many possible economic model provide best description u.s. economy, safe course adopt one robust feedback policies, modify necessary policymakers’ insight judgment, stick it.6the use simple feedback policy also address degree complication raise role private-sector expectations. because simple feedback policy link central bank’s policy instrument short list macroeconomic variables, policy relatively easy public understand use form expectation way monetary policy evolve future. say, example, feedback policy employ central bank stipulate that, inflation rise 10 basis points, policymakers raise short-term interest rate 15 basis point average, subject possible judgmental adjustments. arm information 4 actually, taylor rule strong implication nominal fund rate rise one-for-one inflation rises, imply increase real fund rate well (this prescription so-called taylor principle). the taylor principle seem likely feature good monetary policy thus provide important guidepost policymakers. 5 for example, one proposal would federal reserve adjust growth monetary base response current macroeconomic condition (mccallum, 1988). another would replace output gap taylor rule output growth, variable (unlike output gap) measure directly without reference unobserved variable like “full-employment output” (orphanides williams, 2002). 6 robust feedback policy may also useful member policy committee disagree among economy works, policy seem likely produce acceptable result compete model frameworks. although simulation-based literature describe text produce many valuable insights, also number shortcomings: first, conduct simulation exercises, researcher necessity consider relatively small number simple highly stylize economic model large universe possible alternatives. thus, simulation cannot demonstrate conclusively particular simple feedback policy would robust type uncertainty actually face policymakers. second, although analysis predicate assumption policymakers know structure economy, usually assume (somewhat inconsistently) private agent know true model also know central bank’s feedback policy, allow form accurate policy expectations. allow symmetrical uncertainty part policymakers private agent difficult analytically might produce different results. third, assess compete policies, analysis (with exceptions) often ignore possibility policymakers learn mistakes, modify abandon policy produce bad results, take account uncertainty underlie economic structure form policies. bi review 73/2004 3 estimate strong inflation pressure likely next quarters, financial market participant able forecast future value short-term interest rate, allow price bond financial asset efficiently. because, simple feedback policy, private-sector expectation likely broadly consistent central bank’s plans, effectiveness monetary policy would enhance well. the second general approach make monetary policy i today call forecast-based policy (svensson, 2004c). a name suggests, forecast-based policy regime, policymakers must predict economy likely respond medium term - say, next six eight quarter - alternative plan monetary policy. for example, monetary policy maker might interest evaluate strategy keep federal fund rate low period alternative plan imply gradual rise rates.7 under forecast-based approach, policy plan consideration, policymakers staff must make best guess economy likely evolve plan implemented. they may also try ass likelihood outcome principal scenario. for example, might conclude certain policy plan likely produce good result circumstance less-probable scenario also exist policy plan consideration would lead bad results. take baseline forecast various risk forecast account, policymakers choose plan seem likely produce best result overall. their current choice interest rate correspond first step implement prefer plan. this process repeat meeting, policy plan modify necessary response new information new knowledge economy. how forecast-based policy deal informational constraint role expectations, two issue i raise begin remarks? clearly, forecast-based policy require information implement simple feedback policies, fact often stress opponent approach. indeed, opponent approach argue, major risk use forecast-based policy monetary policy makers, like human beings, may prone think know really do. excessive optimism monetary policy realistically accomplish, claim, might conceivably lead bad economic outcome would intellectually modest stance. in response critique, proponent forecast-based policy suggest ability forecast economy, though modest, nil, make use knowledge have. in particular, note, use forecast-based policy require policy committee member adhere strictly particular econometric model economic theory. economic forecasts, central bank private sector, typically reflect output suite model statistical methods, plus heavy dose judgment insight experience economists. forecast also structure take account model data uncertainty - example down-weighting change variables, output gap, know poorly measure (williams, 2004). so long policymakers staff remain appropriately humble forecast ability knowledge economy, proponent argue, forecast-based policy likely provide good result simple feedback policies. supporter also point that, comparison simple feedback policies, forecast-based approach provide guidance incorporate judgment special information policymaking. a i noted, advocate approach agree that, principle, good policy practice leaf scope discretion use expert judgment. but how, specifically, done? simple feedback policies, presume good deal agnosticism economy’s underlie structure, provide clear framework answer question, except qualitative terms. under forecast-based approach, contrast, answer straightforward: judgment special information affect policy choice extent affect forecast risk forecast. for example, simulation econometric model may imply policy a likely produce good outcome policy b; expert judgment suggest model’s 7 more realistically, plan might include contingent elements; example, might involve keep fund rate low unless inflation begin rise, case rate would allow rise well. stipulate policy plan, least general terms, essential context forecast-based policies, specify current value policy rate provide enough information construct forecast. 4 bi review 73/2004 forecast take special information circumstance fully account, policy a entail economic risk capture model, policy b may prefer instead. what role private-sector expectation determine effect policy? again information requirement forecast-based policy relatively demanding. in contrast case simple feedback policies, forecast-based policy financial market participant simple formula guide form expectation future short-term rates; instead, must infer likely course policy base economic forecast knowledge policymakers’ outlook objectives. give complexity central bank’s forecast policy evaluation processes, make inference daunt challenge. clearly, forecast-based policy, central banker scope provide considerable help private sector attempt anticipate policy changes. to extent policymakers accurately communicate outlook, objectives, tactic public, financial market efficient monetary policy effective (bernanke, 2004). i return issue communication shortly. the policy framework federal reserve it would nice, point, i could tell definitively whether simple feedback policy forecast-based policy represent superior approach make monetary policy. but draw strong conclusion juncture would premature, say least. the debate monetary economics literature remain lively. moreover, degree, central bank practice remain eclectic. at federal reserve, simple feedback forecast-based approach use provide information policymakers. for example, fomc member routinely compare policy choice prescription various form taylor rule (as noted, type simple feedback policy) result model simulation forecast exercise undertake staff board twelve reserve bank (as require forecast-based approach).8although i try resolve deep debate frameworks, i say something degree central bank rely approach practice. both simple feedback policy forecast-based policy influence policymakers think decisions, i noted. however, judgment, reliance two approach symmetric; instead, forecast-based approach become increasingly dominant monetary policymaking lead central banks. this dominance reflect resource central bank devote data collection model increase sophistication detail central bank forecasts.9 indeed, number central bank explicit inflation objective publish regular forecast closely link monetary policy decision forecasts.10the federal reserve explicitly link policy action forecasts, projection economy likely perform different policy plan nevertheless central monetary policy process unite states; is, federal reserve rely primarily forecast-based approach make policy. to provide evidence assertion, well reason it, i draw attention speech chairman greenspan make early year, entitle “risk uncertainty monetary policy” (greenspan, 2004). to sure, chairman’s remark make clear profoundly aware uncertainty policymakers must face make decisions, appropriately cautious rely heavily particular model, theory, 8 reifschneider, stockton, wilcox (1997) describe forecast process role policymaking process federal reserve. 9 sims (2002) analyze policy process four major central banks, include federal reserve. he describe central role play forecast inflation output, develop combination model expert judgment. forecast may contingent different assumption policy path shock hit economy. to increase degree, forecast accompany measure uncertainty, “fan charts” publish bank england describe range statistically probable outcomes. to obtain accurate assessment current state economy improve forecasts, central bank staff collect analyze large amount data; hunger data seem inconsistent simple feedback policy, us limit data inputs. sims criticize certain aspect forecast methodology use suggest improvements, question central bank put forecast center policymaking. 10 in comprehensive study twenty inflation-targeting central banks, fracasso, genberg, wyplosz (2001) find nineteen twenty routinely report forecast public. forecast horizon typically range one two years, two country (new zealand switzerland) extend forecast three years. about half central bank study use fan chart communicate uncertainty forecasts. bi review 73/2004 5 data series. nevertheless, speech present several reason conclude good policy must primarily forecast-based. these reason include need preemptive policymaking, importance take account change structure economy, value term risk-management approach policy. i discus briefly. preemption refer idea policymakers achieve good result act advance forestall develop problems. early action work best monetary policy work lag develop problem (such rise inflation) may often defuse low cost early stages. in principle, simple feedback policy inconsistent preemptive approach; however, extent episode unique features, information capture simple feedback policy may need deal effectively emerge issues. refer monetary policy development 1980s, greenspan writes: in recognition lag monetary policy’s impact economic activity, preemptive response potential build inflationary pressure make even important feature policy. a consequence, approach elevate forecast even prominent place policy deliberations. structural change economy notoriously difficult ass happen, extent change identify incorporate central bank’s forecast, forecast-based policy likely perform good simple feedback policies. in mid-1990s, chairman greenspan fomc colleague famously recognize important structural change, apparent increase trend productivity growth. to quote chairman’s speech: a consequence improve trend structural productivity growth apparent 1995 forward, feed able much accommodative rise economic growth past experience would deem prudent. in short, upon determine important structural change occurring, fomc feel constrain respond current development output inflation past - indication committee’s policymaking base forecast-based analysis, simple feedback approach. perhaps interest confirmation role forecast federal reserve policymaking, however, chairman greenspan’s description call risk-management approach monetary policy. the risk-management approach clearly forecast-based policy. in describe implementation approach, greenspan describe model expert judgment combine project likely scenario economy also amount probability distribution possible economic outcomes. under risk-management approach, policymakers choose policy strategy imply desirable probability distributions. to quote greenspan one time: give inevitably incomplete knowledge. . . . central bank need consider likely future path economy also distribution possible outcome path. the decisionmakers need reach judgment probabilities, costs, benefit various possible outcome alternative choice policy. moreover, risk-management approach, models, judgments, forecasts, policy continually update light new information, theory would suggest. operationally, risk-management approach differ forecast-based policy describe much monetary economics literature one important respect. for simplicity, researcher generally analyze forecast-based policy assumption policymakers care average economic outcomes. however, practice, policymakers often concern average likely outcome also risk objective pose relatively low-probability events. for example, although probability last year pernicious deflation unite state small, potential consequence event sufficiently worrisome possibility occur could ignored. in spirit, greenspan’s risk-management approach sensibly reflect fact entire distribution possible outcomes, average likely expect outcome, matter policy choice. this view certainly realistic, analysis forecast-based policy central bank care whole probability distribution potential outcome begin receive attention literature (see, example, svensson, 2004a). to reiterate, however, policy framework espouse chairman greenspan much forecast-based approach; indeed, require make judgment unlikely 6 bi review 73/2004 well likely economic outcomes, place great demand ability forecast ass risk simple forecast-based approach focus average outcome only. a i mention earlier, i try draw definite conclusion today relative merit simple feedback policy forecast-based policies. i note, however, central bank choose rely heavily forecast-based policy also results, least recent years, generally quite good, economy enjoy low inflation overall economic stability.11 so long good performance persists, least, simple feedback approach face sort catch-22 problem: without demonstrate record success, central bank reluctant adopt approach; unless central bank begin rely simple feedback policies, real-world evidence support approach lacking.12flexibility communication in previous talk i argue clear communication central bank important element effective monetary policy (bernanke, 2004). i conclude brief remark distinction simple feedback policy forecast-based policy bear value central bank communication relationship central bank communication policy flexibility. central bank communication transparency important precisely role private-sector expectation determine effectiveness monetary policy, theme i highlight today. the economic stimulus provide monetary policy depend mostly longer-term interest rates, turn largely determine expectation financial market participant future course monetary policy. a general matter, guidance central bank provide public policy likely evolve (or principle policy decision based), great chance market participant make appropriate inference - thus great probability long-term interest rate move manner consistent outlook objective monetary policy committee. my discussion today suggests, however, benefit central bank communication depend crucially policy approach used. a i noted, central bank follow simple feedback policy (with relatively judgmental deviations), private sector’s problem infer future policy action greatly simplified. the principal task market participant case would forecast macroeconomic variable feature simple feedback policy, course policy could infer reasonable accuracy. extensive communication central bank may essential simple feedback policy employed, except case policymakers decide deviate substantially prescription simple feedback relationship. under forecast-based approach, contrast, public generally find infer likely course policy great deal difficult. in regime, policy plan depend complex way policymakers’ outlooks, risk assessments, objectives, public unlikely deduce accurately without guidance. clear communication thus appear especially important central bank employ forecast-based approach policy - category include contemporary central banks, include federal reserve. this conclusion bear turn relationship communication policy flexibility modern central banking. one sometimes hear view provide information public central bank’s forecasts, plans, objective inhibit flexibility policy effectively restrict policymakers’ future choices. this claim might correct current set federal fund rate fully describe overall degree monetary stimulus restraint, way 11 i attribute improve performance technical improvement model forecast but, perhaps importantly, increase attention policymakers objective keep inflation low stable. the framework call constrain discretion - idea short-run stabilization policy must constrain requirement inflation remain low stable - enhance overall stability anchor inflation expectation give policymakers leeway respond short-run disturbance (bernanke, 2003). 12 an alternative approach evaluate feedback policy compare prediction actual policy decision period monetary policy judge “successful.” kozicki (1999) perform exercise taylor rule conclude provide robust guide policy. in case, evaluation method shortcoming allow possibility use alternative policy approach would change private sector form expectations, turn would affect optimal policy path. bi review 73/2004 7 position gas pedal particular moment fully describe impetus driver provide vehicle. in case, central bank talk could limit future policy options, much provide advance itinerary automobile trip may reduce flexibility take unplanned detour required. however, seen, automotive analogy poor one. monetary policy work largely indirect channel - particular, influence private-sector expectation thus long-term interest rates. consequently, fail communicate public create genuine policy flexibility reduce potency predictability effect give policy actions. to keep monetary policy flexible effective, particularly forecast-based approach policy like employ federal reserve, clear communication part central bank essential. 8 bi review 73/2004 european central bank: press conference - introductory statement introductory statement mr jean-claude trichet, president european central bank, mr lucas papademos, vice president european central bank, frankfurt, 2 december 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, vice-president i report outcome today’s meet govern council ecb. all all, short-term outlook inflation remain worrisome, assessment price development medium term unchanged. at current juncture oil price development sizeable impact consumer price euro area, significant evidence strong underlie domestic inflationary pressure build up. accordingly, leave key ecb interest rate unchanged historically low levels. at time, recognise existence upside risk price stability medium term. continue vigilance essence regard risks. i shall explain assessment detail, turn first economic analysis. after positive development first half 2004, economic growth moderate second half. in third quarter year, real gdp growth estimate 0.3% quarter quarter, 0.7% 0.5% previous two quarters. accord eurostat, contribution net export turn negative, reflect particular high import growth, private consumption subdued, probably dampen high oil prices. at time, investment growth increase inventory build up. the available survey information october november point ongoing growth fourth quarter, albeit moderate pace first half year. the condition remain place economic growth proceed. on external side, global growth show sign moderation, nonetheless expect remain robust. euro area export continue benefit global demand conditions. on domestic side, investment support favourable finance condition euro area, improve earn great corporate efficiency gain business restructuring. finally, scope exist private consumption strengthen, particularly uncertainty surround extent pace fiscal consolidation structural reform reduced. accordingly, expect gradual recovery euro area activity next two years, somewhat moderate growth rate due impact oil prices. this also reflect eurosystem staff projections. euro area real gdp growth project 1.6% 2.0% average 2004, 1.4% 2.4% 2005 1.7% 2.7% 2006. available forecast international private sector organisation convey broadly similar picture. downside risk projection stem particular potentially unfavourable development oil market. in order limit risks, second-round effect wage price-setting must avoid fiscal authority refrain take measure would prolong distort necessary adjustment process. moreover, degree competition euro area energy sector important factor allow high oil price absorb without significant distortions. further progress increase competition sector would highly beneficial. turn consumer prices, annual hicp inflation 2.2% november, accord eurostat’s flash estimate, 2.4% october. over come months, inflation rate 2% likely persist, temporary increase current level cannot excluded. look ahead, however, information available far indicate hicp inflation would fall 2% course 2005 adverse shock occur suggest strong underlie inflationary pressure build euro area. wage increase remain contain recent quarter and, context ongoing moderate growth weak labour markets, trend continue future. producer price rising,

price increase effect previous indirect tax administer price rise gradually dissipate, annual hicp inflation project 1.5% 2.5% 2005 1.0% 2.2% 2006. these projection broadly consistent forecast recently release international private sector organisations. bi review 73/2004 1 several upside risk need take account. concern relate particular future oil price development and, generally, potential risk second-round effect wage price-setting throughout economy. further development indirect tax administer price also need monitor closely. further insight outlook price developments, medium longer-term horizons, provide monetary analysis. the late monetary data confirm downward trend annual m3 growth observe middle 2003 continue recent month even reversed. over course 2004, monetary dynamic drive two oppose forces. on one hand, historically low level interest rate euro area stimulate m3 dynamics, particular demand liquid component m3 contain narrow aggregate m1. on hand, portfolio allocation behaviour tend normalise past year follow exceptionally strong preference liquidity observe period heighten economic financial uncertainty 2001 mid-2003. however, investors’

cross-check monetary analysis support case continue vigilance regard materialisation risk price stability medium term. it essence avoid spillover short-term consumer price development long-term

(william shakespeare, henry vi part 3, act iv scene 3) 1. introduction my subject tonight risk: think about, talk about, manage risk. so let start thank come take risk spend hour central banker. few writer put central banker place, one nancy mitford, whose centenary celebrate last sunday. in the pursuit love love cold climate describe marriage linda, heroine, son governor bank england. the marriage linda incredibly bore tony doom outset. a lady montdore explained, “bankers don’t seem much look - extraordinarily unsuitable know all, poor things, let alone marry them”. i don’t suppose lady montdore would come lecture, i would point life full surprises. risk, luck, fate, uncertainty, probability theory - name game chance. most decision life involve risk. sometimes embrace it, enjoy bet grand national, sometimes avoid it, insure house fire. the play hand deal may pleasure bridge burden life. we accept lady luck part play personal lives. but collective life - public policy - role probability rarely take centre stage. an inform discussion public policy issues, however, require analysis risk uncertainty involved. whether policy health transport, matter monetary meteorological, time war peace, decision reflect balance risks. yet policy debate continue permeate “illusion certainty”.1the reluctance give adequate prominence risk may reflect fact many u feel uncomfortable formal statement probabilities. probability theory relatively recent intellectual history, date back flower idea around 1660 pascal, leibniz, huygens others.2 despite advance since then, statistical think remain prone confusion often avoided. television weather forecast britain rarely employ language probability use meteorologist themselves. professor gigerenzer max planck institute berlin demonstrate series study poorly doctors, lawyers, professional understand probabilities. and despite seneca’s maxim “luck never make man wise”, airport bookshop stock title become rich successful investor entrepreneur confident success result outstanding business acumen rather good fortune. many misunderstand stem failure grasp basic statistical concepts. jury inform that, country size, multiple cot death likely occur several time year, several people dna match incriminate sample, 1 to use phrase professor gerd gigerenzer do anyone draw attention lack public understand risk. 2 for intellectual history probability theory see hack (1975) bernstein (1996). bi review 73/2004 1 coincidence evidence guilt. bookshop stock title “i would billionaire lady luck faithful”.3in lecture tonight i want illustrate two propositions. first, wide range collective decision vital think term probabilities. we cannot avoid take decisions, must accept need analyse uncertainty inevitably surround them. h.g. well often report say that, “statistical think one day necessary efficient citizenship ability read write”. and even true today inundate statistic every quarter. second, order public discussion frame term risks, public need receive accurate objective information risks. transparency honesty risk essential part decision-making process explanation decisions. i want illustrate two proposition consider example public policy pension - issue, might think, particular interest many u academy. when pension commission report october, highlight finance gap present system. but must lose sight equally important question risk incur pension provision share among us? it intention make recommendations. that pension commission next year, government turn. but i want show risk heart issue. 2. the nature risk “in world nothing say certain, except death taxes” write benjamin franklin 1789. great man though franklin was, clear indeed substantial uncertainty death, least timing, contribution tax require pay pensions. when think much save retirement, three main risk consider. first, much earn future? second, rate return savings? third, long likely live? tonight i shall focus exclusively longevity risk - uncertainty long shall live - order focus two proposition probabilistic think public policy.4none u know long shall live. but ass chance look experience others. a key distinction individual collective risk. chart 1 plot observe mortality rate different age woman england wale 2002, recent year detail data available.

the expectation life rise significantly past century. but change future? to answer question need model quantify longevity risk. 3. model quantify risk quantitative model one great advance social science past fifty years. but forecasts, whether longevity economic social variable, inevitably require judgment far past inform u future. project longevity fraught difficulty. in first essay population, malthus write 1798 “with regard duration human life, appear existed, early age world, present moment, small permanent symptom, indication, increase prolongation”. we know 1798 life expectancy britain around 40. today nearly 80. there agree method forecast life expectancy. the widespread approach assume life expectancy gradually approach limit determine medical knowledge choice lifestyle. a key uncertainty limit life is, demographer pursue many way estimate it.6 but successive forecast limit life disprove actual life expectancy data surpass suppose limit. chart 4 plot forecast limit female life life expectancy achieve long live female population. a life span increased, forecast limit life revise up. the fact simply know life expectancy change future. unforeseen, indeed unimagined, development medical science could change prospect life expectancy radically. in end face ignorance. provide insurance longevity, whether private annuity public pensions, rest ability calculate risk involved. but present degree knowledge mean that, terminology frank knight (1921), risk, quantified, uncertainty, cannot. the extent past uncertainty life expectancy see revision forecast make past 20 year government actuary’s department. nor financial sector prove good forecasting. chart 5 show successive forecast expect length life men age 60 publish actuarial profession, body life assurance company annuity providers. it show reduction mortality expect industry lead rise length life. for example, pink line show actuarial profession forecast make 1980 man 60 year could expect live another 20 years. at time, think someone reach 60 1999 would live 21 years. but 1999 forecast man 60 would live another 26 years. over twenty year period, expect length life revise 5 years. length life rise fast industry anticipated, see 5 the first estimate mortality rate use bill mortality city london publish john graunt 1662. but widespread use data price annuity begin calculation richard price 1780 institute actuary 1869. in holland accurate calculation price annuity date back de witt 1671. see poterba (2004). 6 manton et al (1991) caselli vallin (2001) describe alternative approach infer limit human life. some estimate assume life expectancy converge longest-lived population; example, life expectancy west rise japan, country high life expectancy. but level japan increase significantly past century. so determine japan’s life expectancy? another approach examine life expectancy might change everyone adopt lifestyle pattern increase longevity. mormon seventh day adventist seem live long rest us, exactly aspect lifestyle adopt entirely clear. see, example, enstrom (1989). yet another approach work contribution different human disease make premature death, calculate hypothetical life expectancy would result medical science able eliminate diseases. this ‘cause elimination’ approach adopt 1950s pichat. the number derive 75. this number un use early 1980s population projections. the number use 85, base similar approach benjamin (1982) olshansky et.al. (1990). and evidence limit increase human lifespan mixed; see example, kannisto et.a.l. (1994) wilmoth horiuchi (1999). bi review 73/2004 3 upward shift time forecast expect life rate expect increase.7that large unavoidable uncertainty forecast longevity clear. the key unknown evolution lifestyle, disease ability medical science combat them. no amount complex demographic model substitute good judgement unknowns. the danger rely computer model well illustrate world health organisation’s early estimate future spread aids, which, time, significant unknown forecast life expectancy even develop countries. aid first recognise 1981. the virus responsible aids, call hiv, identify 1984. to date, around 20 million people think die disease worldwide. the proportion infect hiv go develop aid think close 100%. but spread hiv, hence aids, uneven. at end last year percentage adult infect hiv estimate 0.2% unite kingdom, 21.5% south africa, 37.3% botswana, yet 3.9% angola. why infection rate differ much countries? in 1980s world health organization associate researcher make rather optimistic projection impact aid population africa use extremely detail computer model population structure. complex demographic model combine strong simplify assumption sexual behaviour. unfortunately, lead modeller ignore factor critical spread aids. they assume probability transmit hiv infection function number sexual acts, number partner infect persons. but crucial distinguish two.8 ten act one partner small impact transmission infection one act ten different partners. a professor (now lord) may, president royal society, point out, ignore simple crucial distinction lead serious underestimate rate aid likely spread.9 by build elaborate model demographic variable great deal information available make simple assumption behaviour little known, large model use world health organisation produce mislead results. the fact data sexual behaviour available good reason focus demographic variable - researcher look key lamp-post rather fell. quantitative model obviously essential explain empirical evidence. but idea single comprehensive model, whether population economy, capture relevant feature explain phenomenon illusion.10 there substitute think underlie process generate data. robert may’s article “uses abuse mathematics biology”, publish early year, compulsory read anyone involve public policy. in point danger model complex intuition impossible, writes, “it make sense convey beguile sense ‘reality’ irrelevant detail, equally important factor guess at. … remember einstein’s dictum: ‘models simple possible, so’” (may, 2004). in many areas, successful public policy depend quantitative analysis risk expert researchers. it important general public understand assessment judgments. to enhance confidence judgment expert need engage debate among know know. on bank england’s monetary policy committee nine member debate among current state knowledge 7 the data chart 5 occupational pension holder actuarial profession member institutions. these individual typically wealthy rest population, reason tend live longer. 8 peterman et. al. (1988) find probability infect partner unrelated number sexual act partner. 9 the large model make simplify assumption rate take one two values. in fact, vary widely among population. robert may, colleague roy anderson, show key driver proportion population eventually infect “variance rate acquisition new sexual partners”. simulation proportion population ultimately infect aid sensitive variance, plausible difference number partner among different people change estimate proportion likely infect 25% 90%. 10 many non-economists believe economist use single “model” explain economic phenomena. hence interest many commentator “the model” allege generate forecast inflation economic growth publish bank england. but, never cease point out, bank us one many model help u understand particular aspect economic behaviour. the relevant model change one forecast another. 4 bi review 73/2004 behaviour economy. the result discussion publish month, committee, yesterday, appear regularly front parliamentary committees. so i turn question information judgment risk communicate general public. 4. communicate risk public although often impossible precise risk surround decision, vital policymakers resist temptation communicate false sense certainty. two key principle govern communication risk public. first, information must provide objectively place context risk assess understood. second, expert policy-makers must open extent knowledge ignorance. transparency know don’t know, far undermine credibility, help build trust confidence policy-makers. (a) (mis)understanding probability the first principle state information probability place context. a simple example illustrate difficulty interpret probability context unclear. the stock market volatile difficult, impossible, predict short periods. at begin week chance market rise follow week roughly chance falling. so i predict direction market movement correctly five successive week might think i know something didn’t. indeed, might will subscribe investment service sort track record. so let explain one might create illusion clairvoyance. select around 6000 name address london telephone directory. divide name two groups. to first write predict market rise come week. to second write predict fall market. at end week keep 3000 name give correct prediction discard others. divide name turn two groups. to first predict rise market second fall. repeat process five weeks, point around 200 people could write follow letter. “you may well sceptical receive first letter, know work secret predict successfully direction movement stock market. you know method really works. to subscribe investment service please send £5000 return”. quite president, former deputy chairman financial service authority, would make scheme i know. but illustrate vividly interpretation ex post outcome depend critically understand ex ante process generate outturns. another example show lay people find statistical inference difficult. expert kind too. the advent dna profile 1980s lead use match probability criminal cases. the jury tell probability find match sample take scene crime dna defendant is, example, 1 500,000. that sometimes take evidence probability defendant innocent also 1 500,000. such inference incorrect. in city london might 5 million people could commit crime, around ten people would dna match relevant sample. hence, absence evidence, probability defendant guilty, far overwhelming, one 10. of course, practice evidence usually available. but incorrect statistical reason sway enough case give name - prosecutor’s fallacy.11the case sally clark angela cannings, convict imprison allege murder children, show desperate consequence false use statistic create presumption guilt resolve cause apparently inexplicable events. both woman convict jury likelihood influence assertion probability two cot death family extraordinarily low. that assertion base assumption cot death family independent events, view 11 see, example, thompson schuman (1987). bi review 73/2004 5 scientific evidence priori implausible.12 the assumption independence crucial prosecution evidence sally clark odds two cot death family 1 73 million would expect century. give complex conflict medical evidence, would surprise strike simple statistic play role help jury come conclusion. in fact, point professor ray hill, statistical evidence cot death suggest england wale expect several case year.13 thankfully, woman eventually release win appeals, albeit largely grounds. why probability cause u much difficulty? our understand probability evolve count frequency various events, whether number day summer rain outcome toss coin. all part evolutionary experience long concept probability invent seventeenth century. in book reckon risk, gigerenzer argue forcefully risk present probability term natural frequencies, correspond experience count events. although people understand probability familiar contexts, bet horse race toss coin, easy calculate odds context unfamiliar. (b) explain probability how best present information risk public? both monetary policy committee meet office face problem almost every day: former explain outlook inflation latter forecast weather. both independently develop similar visual representation forecast avoid use word “probability”. chart 6 show forecast inflation next three year publish bank england late inflation report 10 november 2004. it form ‘fan chart’. we say view inflation 2%, number. such statement incoherent forecast inherently probabilistic. so represent uncertainty colour band chart 6.14 their interpretation follows. if find economic circumstance identical today’s 100 occasions, would expect inflation would lie within dark central band 10 occasions. a increase width colour section move dark central band light shade red out, number outturn think lie within section increases. the band draw number outturn increase 10 change colour intensity. the inflation outturn would expect lie somewhere within entire colour area 90 100 occasions. on day bank england produce forecast inflation, meet office produce forecast temperature various town follow ten days. chart 7 show ‘plume chart’, meet office refer fan charts, town reading. i leave detail explanation meteorologists, interpretation temperature plume chart parallel inflation fan chart closely. the width plume chart indicate degree uncertainty future temperatures, different colour suggest different probability bands. and probability central temperature projection - case solid blue line - extremely small. i suggest bbc use chart forecasts, surely might give little freedom meteorologist use probabilistic think describe outlook. such chart also use illustrate uncertainty longevity. chart 8 construct fan chart female life expectancy birth unite kingdom derive late forecast publish government actuary’s department. the width fan chart show forecast life expectancy likely change future, new information idea mortality evolve, 12 to understand concept independence consider example church spire strike lightning several times. be coincidence (implied assumption strike independent other) spire certain characteristic lead strike regularly? give knowledge spire lighten latter plausible. similarly, may characteristics, genetic other, still largely unknown, make particular family likely experience cot death others. 13 hill (2002) (2004). see also dawid (2004) eggleston (1978) discussion difficulty court find concept conditional probability bayes’ theorem. 14 the forecast inflation base assumption interest rate follow path expect financial market average fifteen day prior finalisation inflation report. 6 bi review 73/2004 cause forecast revise - assume news life expectancy arrive future rate past. the colour shade depict probability band use fan chart inflation i show earlier. chart 8 illustrate uncertainty longevity. of course, statistic visual representation use abused. the design chart go backwards since (shown chart 9) napoleon’s march moscow subsequent retreat construct 1861 charles joseph minard, inspecteur-général de ponts et chaussées and, appropriately give tonight’s theme, en retraite. brilliant conception quantity information conveys, chart show devastate loss suffer napoleon’s fateful russian campaign 1812. so i underestimate difficulty promote good understand statistic discussion public policy.15 too often figure bandy without careful description come might tell us. a learn rime ancient statistician (with apology samuel taylor coleridge): figures, figures, everywhere enough make u sink figures, figures, everywhere but none help u think. the second key principle govern explanation risk public open recognition limit present knowledge. the failure damage public confidence policy-makers. the bse affair show danger claim great certainty science warranted. and angela cannings case, court appeal observe that, “not long ago, expert suggest newborn baby lie tummies. that advice base best-informed analysis. nowadays, advice exhortation baby sleep back - back sleep. this advice equally draw best possible know sources”. a court appeal pointedly continued, “it obvious two view cannot both, simultaneously, right”. expert advice invaluable, infallible. a robert may say recently, “open contention opinion exactly serve science well centuries, i believe simply must learn extend openness form science advice policy-making. such open publication advice, frank admission area uncertainty, ultimately engender confidence” (may, 2003). that spirit monetary policy committee create continue function. the challenge extend spirit area policy.16effective communication relevant risk vital. think present information may seem role spin doctor. but whereas spin doctor wish claim certainty correctness master’s decision, present accurate information risk electorate large essential democratic accountability. a one illustrious member profession might said, “spin doctor don’t doubt”. that trouble much debate public policy. a voltaire put it, “doubt pleasant condition, certainty absurd one”.175. manage risk manage risk share risk others. by find way pool risk share upside downside others. this beneficial typically dislike extremes. in language economics, ‘risk averse’. a key part manage risk design institution determine ultimate incidence risk. the pension commission perform valuable service make u aware size shortfall current save finance future pension provision. it report next year various way close fund gap. but additional fundamental question design pension system share risk optimally among individual generations. longevity risk individual collective nature. collective risk raise difficult issue fairness generations. individual risk easy handle. 15 on use misuse statistic see best (2001) briscoe (2000). an outstanding analysis common mistake visual representation statistical data find tufte (1983, 1990). 16 robert rubin, former u treasury secretary clinton administration, stress importance probabilistic think policy-making (rubin weisberg, 2003). 17 letter frederick great, april 16, 1767. bi review 73/2004 7 in theory, individual longevity risk pool private annuity markets. a long provider annuity, typically insurance company, know long live average, additional payment long-lived exactly offset few payment short-lived. by pool risks, annuity provider offer insurance longevity. but offer single annuity risky. in sense sensibility, fanny dashwood explain husband drawback provide annuity family: “if observe, people always live forever annuity pay them. an annuity serious business; come every year, get rid it”.18only small fraction save invest annuities.19 one explanation annuity provider find difficult distinguish healthy sick ex ante, former purchase annuity latter, lead insurance company offer annuity le attractive term thus discourage purchase.20 this “adverse selection” important - approximately 20% expensive buy annuity individual group scheme.21collective risk raise additional problems. longevity risk particular cohort share across generations. those generation alive today pool risk financial markets. but share across generations, include unborn, require collective public insurance variation national debt.22consider annuity provider face risk increase average longevity pool annuitant lead shortfall funds. the annuity provider would clearly like hedge risk way. one way would asset balance sheet pay average longevity annuitant increases. financial market currently develop ‘longevity bonds’ along lines.23the interest rate longevity bond link measure unexpected change average life expectancy. in case recently announce european investment bank-bnp paribas bond, payout year next 25 year fix sum multiply proportion people england wale 65 2003 still live particular year. so five year 90% cohort still alive, payment year 90% fix sum. the cash flow buyer bond decline time, decline le rapidly people live longer. the demand hedge longevity risk might expect come pension fund provider annuities. the supply might come lifeinsurance companies, benefit increase longevity extent few early death mean low claims, financial intermediary collect save young investor prepare bear longevity risk old.24how close private market get provide optimal amount risk share hard say. private annuity market could pool individual longevity risk small. for collective longevity risks, burden unexpectedly high longevity particular cohort spread many generation possible. in theory, provide potential role government share risk across generations. 18 fanny dashwood claim annuity lead “moral hazard” use modern jargon: provision annuity change behaviour way increase life expectancy. 19 see yaari (1965) davidoff et al. (2003). for discussion pension arrangement u see diamond (2003, 2004). 20 for theoretical study annuity provision adverse selection, see brugiavini (1993). 21 finkelstein poterba (2004), instance, note 65 year old men voluntarily buy annuity live 20 percent long men. pauly zeng (2003) find unite state adverse selection make impossible private market prescription drug insurance function. 22 it possible families, accurately dynasties, provide insurance change bequest make descendants: pass large bequest current generation dy early expect small bequest survive long expected. but small proportion bequest seem large enough act buff way. 23 a far i aware, first instrument offer return specifically aggregate longevity issue swiss re, large reinsurance company, 2003. 24 to extent insurance company offer life insurance annuities, may able partially hedge risks. 8 bi review 73/2004 there two way government involvement can, principle, improve risksharing. first, collective schemes, whether compulsory employer-based, avoid cost adverse selection associate individual provision. second, combine tax current employee deficit finance (i.e. tax future employees), statefunded pension transfer risk across generation way private market cannot. alternatively, government could issue longevity bonds. private annuity provider could use hedge aggregate longevity risk. by assume longevity risk government would make possible private sector purchase bond turn support private market annuities. what happen britain past year impossibility obtain longevity risk insurance contributory factor sharp decline private sector provision define benefit pensions. over past ten years, membership private sector define benefit pension scheme still open estimate fall 60% (pensions commission, 2004). it clear market develop annuity pension product index aggregate longevity would allow financial institution pas collective longevity risk onto policy-holders. what clear individual ask take risk absence annuity mean bear individual collective aspect longevity risk. there something say view longevity risk efficiently share collectively, leave private sector provide insurance individual mortality. the question issue would buy longevity bond merit study.25i far discuss longevity risk. clearly, discussion pension reform must include also key collective risks: productivity, rate return fertility among others. we not, course, start clean slate. exist government institution - whether design default - already important risksharing properties. means-tested pension benefits, well national health service, already give government major role share risks. but reform pension system, important separate two issues. first, pay cost present pension commitments? second, right structure pension system: risk bear individually collectively? a debate need whether present arrangement imply much little share risk. we remember also insurance base ignorance - ignorance outcome face individual. but knowledge turn risk certainty. the advent genetic test could undermine private market insurance longevity illhealth. even insurance company could require test condition insurance, fact test available could increase even degree adverse selection insurance markets. pool risk cause unequal genetic inheritance might long feasible. insurance would become instead question redistribution, hence matter public policy. 6. conclusion in lecture i stress public policy decision matter balance risks. there certainty. indeed, illusion certainty undermine much public debate. a bertrand russell said, “the whole problem world fool fanatic always certain themselves, wise people full doubts”. recognise model risk mean understand limit present knowledge. communicate risk transparency. when information risk provide public, often form hard assess. think carefully communication important level public debate. the quantity information le relevant quality - sometimes le more. and manage risk mean make choice - collective choice - basis rational share assessment risk involved. we cannot avoid uncertainty. so let u face it. 25 the question bear collective longevity risk discuss blake burrow (2001), blake (2003), dowd (2003), cox lin (2004a, 2004b), willet (2004), auerbach hassett (2002) among others. bi review 73/2004 9 bi review 73/2004 10 bi review 73/2004 11

governor bank namibia, bank namibia’s annual governor’s address, windhoek, 18 november 2004. * * * invite guests, lady gentlemen: i happy welcome annual event, last five year i share view number issue economic nature. this evening, i go share view prospect monetary union southern african development community (sadc). this topic mean new discuss various speaker various occasions. however, importance worth repeat hopefully start build consensus around issue. the issue monetary integration mean ultimately lead monetary union african continent address two levels. the first level discussion continent-wide, african union continent shall establish common monetary policy therefore common central bank. the association african central bank (aacb) request african union prepare establishment african central bank time framework. the aacb suggest tentative work program see african central bank establish year 2021. the second level discussion regard monetary integration take place regional level, five african region expect work regional monetary integration. in southern african region, sadc work program go establish common central bank region 2016 common currency 2018. the year 2016 sound far enough, mere twelve year now. namibia’s position regard sadc monetary union complicate membership cma. at cma level, also start preliminary discussion point establishment cma central bank ahead sadc central bank. an argument could make since cma member country member sadc, good namibia concentrate sadc monetary union discussions. however, true one certain sadc discussion go ahead per agree timeframe. the concern cma de facto monetary union, except function make monetary decision exercise one member country only. this acceptable arrangement need find equitable solution decision make power exercise member countries. the decision discus continental monetary integration issue two level see realistic strategy succeed. this continent face diverse economic social challenge try discus integration continental level foolhardy, best. join monetary union mean give national currency adopt new currency currency large country. to people give currency provocative notion could equate treason. this especially true small, develop country might gain political independence. the idea subsume large country appeal all. why, then, country want enter monetary union? the increase interest monetary integration closely link process globalization, especially financial globalization, dominant feature discussion various forums. in today’s globalize financial markets, capital become mobile cross-border investment vast. today world financial market large, economy closely integrate financial technology innovative. in context, initiative free trade areas, custom union common market clearly design strategy promote region within global economy. increasingly, globalization process term integrate market see mechanism enhance promote region’s bi review 72/2004 1 competitiveness vis-à-vis trade block enlarge internal markets. the key element process removal internal trade barrier free flow factor production especially labour capital. in globalise financial market, effectiveness independent monetary policy questionable, especially small open economy one form fix exchange rate arrangements. it argue hard country simultaneously maintain fix exchange rate open capital market pursue independent monetary policy gear towards domestic economic policy. a country opt part financial globalization, except outcome desirable. what likely happen country isolate might become marginalize term participation world economy. i must also hasten add globalization portray good world, also true globalization benefit country prepare take advantage new system. in order benefit globalise economy, i recognize three issue critical importance. first, country need ensure necessary human skill capable compete effectively within world economy. second, country would need institutional arrangement conform international standards. example institution must practice good governance; must effective account regime; must clear demarcation function responsibility among institutions. the third issue i believe important effective legal framework, business individual alike certain legal contract enforceable timely manner. in region, increase interest momentum creation monetary union seem revolve around two main considerations. the first establishment monetary union combination free trade agreement increasingly see part strategic push integrate region. in regard, monetary union see way reinforce regional cohesion demonstrate commitment regional solidarity. indeed, harmonization unification monetary policy represent deep form economic financial integration. the second consideration formation monetary union desire counteract perceive economic political weakness date back period colonial rule put place regional institutions, monetary union common currency would strong symbols. it would also appear launch european monetary union influence process. a strong argument motivation monetary union bring number benefits. the often cite benefit increase intra trade, price stability, increase aggregate investment, elimination exchange rate risk. it argue elimination exchange rate risk would allow increase capital inflow regional investment opportunity result welfare gain growth. it also reduce transaction cost within region incur change one currency another. besides increase intra-trade, economic theory experience also suggest single regional currency expect stable internal external value. therefore, benefit price stability monetary policy credibility likely realize monetary union. this especially true regional monetary authority autonomous carry function primary objective price stability. it also suggest monetary union would improve macroeconomic stability ensure fiscal monetary policy credibility. this necessary attraction investments, eventually translate economic growth potential investor would invest full confidence would get sufficient return investments. there also cost involve participate monetary union. by far often talk cost, loss autonomy manage monetary policy. arguably, national autonomy monetary policy suppose give country maximum freedom flexibility, use various monetary instrument interest rate reserve requirements, steer economy particular direction. give monetary policy key instrument macroeconomic management, constraint impose monetary union pursuit country specific objective may therefore view constitute hindrance achieve country specific economic goals. this point important especially sadc country different stage development different degree financial economic structures. such diversity would make difficult sustain monetary union. therefore, unitary monetary policy region would daunt task 2 bi review 72/2004 especially give fact country different shock may require different policy responses. yet, financial globalization teach u use independent monetary policy severely limited. with globalization, cross-border capital flow inevitable make independent monetary policy ineffective especially small develop countries. the logical conclusion country better-off monetary union since cannot, case, effectively implement independent monetary policy. another cost associate monetary union ability government conduct fiscal policy constrain limit collectively agree impose respect budget deficit financing. the imposition limit deficit finance necessitate desire prevent member state run large unsustainable deficit could put upward pressure interest rate exchange rate entire monetary union area. i would, however, want believe restriction deficit finance benefit cost, encourage prudence fiscal management. a monetary union feasible among country open economy strong trade link other. furthermore, monetary union likely successful significant degree economic convergence among member country respect macroeconomic variables. in sadc region, empirical data indicate region meet criterion suggest optimum currency area theory, neither convergence economic variables. the process establish sadc monetary union therefore long macroeconomic convergence must establish first. the lack convergence key macroeconomic variable may suggest region yet ready common currency. however, i must add may crucial meet criterion prior formation union. it possible member country agree meet criterion formation monetary union. experience also teach u case european union, economic argument define factor formation monetary union, also political drive unification. it therefore important political champion promote cause sadc monetary union. in european example, germany france political champion monetary integration. let conclude say that, general monetary union desirable likely promote macro-economic stability economic growth among member states. however, monetary union see end part process wide economic integration region. to ensure successful implementation sadc monetary union within agree timeframe, important member country intensify redouble effort towards realization noble objective. in particular, member country would need pursue appropriate policy measure order satisfy convergence criteria. give importance issue sensitivity around it, crucial citizen member country properly inform desirability monetary union. a sadc monetary union also unique challenges. member country therefore prepare optimally benefit new arrangement. for example, member country would need strategically position increase share intra trade investment within sadc beyond. in case namibia, need continue diversification economy towards manufacture services. we also need term concrete action plan develop human capital. this vital area lot say far, little evidence suggest succeed build human capital ready compete effectively global economy. thank

pose challenge implementation monetary policy. singapore dollar capital market grow enormously last five years. foreign participation go up. more foreign investor likely participate market singapore government security include world government bond index next january. our market surveillance must broaden mix market participant become diverse. a volume trade singapore dollar security increases, management singapore dollar become challenging. we must constantly review improve intervention strategy communication market. we must also continue strengthen regulatory supervisory framework, line change industry evolve risk issues. a local player go regional expand activities, must take approach consolidate integrate supervision next level. we enhance framework supervise local banks’ security asset management operation overseas, well fine-tune framework integrate supervision bank engage capital market insurance activities. in addition, co-operate closely regulator order adequately supervise institution operate markets. a financial institution turn outsourcing, review need supervise company provide significant outsource service institutions. with convergence product offer

central bank, conference european economic integration (ceei), vienna, 29 november 2004. * * * lady gentlemen, i delight talk vienna distinguish audience conference south eastern europe, first kind organise österreichische nationalbank. let also warmly congratulate oenb governor liebscher initiative. when i think recent enlargement eu central bank term i cannot without think contribution oenb, involve enlargement issue beginning. this thank long-standing expertise central eastern europe. with event, oenb clearly demonstrate is, inside eurosystem, forefront analysis european integration. the topic today - south eastern european challenge prospect - indeed broad one.1 challenge refer mainly arise process transition centrally plan market economy. in respect, similar one eight country face join eu early year. but, friend coparticipant conference governor nicholl central bank bosnia herzegovina put it, country former yugoslavia also two transition particular challenges: transition part large state independent democratic country transition war peace. i intend dwell issue indeed important think south eastern europe. in set stage discussion today tomorrow, i focus remark three aspects. i first make remark economic monetary performance region; i touch upon process economic financial integration eu and, lastly, i briefly discus use euro region. a i explain detail, economic monetary performance improve last years, although much remain done. economic link eu strengthening. these link also base widespread use euro. economic monetary performance south eastern europe south eastern europe diverse complex region, characterise relatively low level income compare western europe. the seven country consider south eastern europe combine population around 53 million people, combine gdp 2003, nominal exchange rates, amount around 120 billion euro. this give average gdp per caput around 2,300 euro. even one adjust purchase power standards, income per caput across region stand 2003 26% eu average (compared equivalent figure new member state around 48% eu average). another feature common country region relatively fast growth experience recent years. annual real gdp growth region 4% since 2001 catch real income take place. in 2003, third year row, economy country south eastern europe grow faster, average, country central eastern europe baltic join eu last may however, estimate suggest that, real gdp terms, economy south eastern european country still stand fifteen year ago, reflect slow progress transition early 1990s economic disruption due war political turmoil. thus, order catch live standard eu strong growth need foster real convergence. 1 within context conference south eastern europe understand comprise follow countries: albania, bosnia herzegovina, bulgaria, croatia, fyr macedonia, romania serbia montenegro. bi review 72/2004 1 monetary performance across region also see significant improvement recent past. up 1998 few four country region (out 7) inflation rate exceed 20% annually. after 1998 disinflation proceed median inflation rate among country region remain single digit ever since. this say challenge ahead disinflation front. in case inflation remain high challenge remain continue bring inflation down. in cases, adjustment administer price indirect price may still cause pick inflation. in circumstances, challenge avoid temporary spike inflation rate translate increase inflationary expectations. progress bring inflation accomplish variety monetary exchange rate frameworks. one classify regime place three different groups: (i) euro-based currency board (bosnia herzegovina bulgaria); (ii) peg manage float euro reference currency (croatia, fyr macedonia, romania serbia); and, (iii) independent float (albania). in addition, two territory within serbia montenegro (kosovo montenegro) monetary exchange rate policy determine unilateral euroisation - issue i return late remarks. a title panel discussion take place afternoon highlights, country specific circumstance call different choice monetary exchange rate policy change circumstance may call change approach followed. i expand issue emphasise regardless actual monetary exchange rate framework chosen, crucial consolidate culture price stability, buttress independent central banks. outside realm monetary exchange rate policy i would like briefly touch upon fiscal external developments. in area fiscal developments, fair recognise fiscal deficit region whole stand low level, term gdp, since begin transition. nevertheless, interpret caution, particularly light positive output development observe recently. the positive side economic cycle provide fact fit opportunity procede fiscal consolidation, well necessary reform structure fiscal expenditure revenues. development external balance country region provide sober reading. current account deficit increase last three years, stood, region whole 8% gdp 2003. while deficit may partly stem natural welcome recapitalisation economy region, fast credit growth may contribute exacerbate current account deficit number countries. of course, give low level financial intermediation characterise economy region, increase lend activity extent welcome sign financial sector perform role within economy whole. however, give link often identify lend boom bank currency crisis, clear authority region number case take step avoid credit growth may fast. more broadly, country region still lag behind central eastern europe baltics, measure indicator ebrd’s transition indicators. improvement quality judiciary, overall business environment and, generally, institutional reform needed. on positive side, noteworthy that, among transition countries, precisely south eastern european region one see progress last year so. one cannot help associate progress pull enlargement eu may provide. economic financial integration eu in recent year observe number development testament ongoing process economic financial integration south eastern european region eu. the eu far important trade partner country region, account half three quarter foreign trade country region. moreover, export performance country remain positive regardless economic condition main export markets. at time, old trade pattern within region long gone, leave trade integration among south eastern european country low level. more need done, example implementation bilateral free trade agreement already signed, area. 2 bi review 72/2004 another element point towards economic financial integration region eu recent increase inflow foreign direct investment. while precise figure hard come by, fdi inflow often come euro area. this well know austria - rank among top five lead investor le four country region. in addition financial sector, fdi typically concentrate manufacture industry well transport telecommunications. often, manufacture activity region well integrate production structure western european economies, attract comparatively low cost south eastern europe relative geographic proximity. for region whole, fdi percentage gdp close 5% 2003. it note level low compare central eastern europe baltic countries. the cumulative fdi inflow country south eastern europe period 1989 2003 average le usd 700 per capita, approximately one third comparable figure central eastern european baltic countries. i mention briefly investment financial intermediary area euro area investor particularly active. in fact, euro area bank financial institution important investor respective bank sectors, contribute financial development region. let turn attention use euro region. use euro south eastern europe south eastern europe region one see use euro international currency dimensions. the oenb do much work document this. the ecb also monitor regularly development international role euro, include use south eastern europe. a know, eurosystem take neutral position regard internationalisation euro. in regard, also worth recall position adopted, already ecofin november 2000, country aim eu accession cannot use unilateral euroisation way circumvent stage foresee treaty establish european community adoption euro.2 a finance currency, euro denominate debt regularly issue country region, also, i note above, often make use euro anchor, reserve intervention currency monetary exchange rate frameworks. the euro also increasingly use invoice currency international trade country region. in case bulgaria, long span data available, see 37% bulgarian export invoice euro 2000, figure rise 61% 2003. the increase particularly notable give fact bulgarian export euro area account 51% total bulgarian export 2003, compare 42% back 2000. that is, 2000 bulgarian export euro area great export invoice euro, 2003 opposite true. euro cash inherit role store value legacy currencies, principally d-mark also austrian schilling, play country region. but introduction euro also coincide interest development region. in nutshell, euro cash changeover accompany many south eastern european country strong increase euro-denominated deposits. in many countries, particularly former yugoslav republics, household deposit cash legacy currency - previously keep “under mattress” - bank rather exchange directly new euro banknotes, reflect increase confidence respective bank systems. conclude remark let conclude focus prospects. to large extent, prospect summarise words: progress towards eu membership. of course, country region different stage path towards eu membership, reflect different status candidate potential candidate countries. indeed, bulgaria romania expect sign accession treaty next year whereas country still prepare negotiation stabilisation 2 report (ecofin) council european council nice exchange rate aspect enlargement, brussels, 8 november 2000, council european union press release no. 13055/00. also reiterate “policy position govern council european central bank exchange rate issue relate accede countries,” frankfurt, 18 december 2003, www.ecb.int. bi review 72/2004 3 association agreements. moreover, economic, also political criterion country pas transform current eu perspective real progress towards association accession. let also emphasise ecb eurosystem whole contributor process, least provision technical assistance. cooperation among central bank involve twin project - lead eurosystem national central bank particular banque de france, banca d’italia de nederlandsche bank - bulgarian national bank national bank romania, well visit training, gear towards share information know-how. it take place large number areas, payment systems, supervision financial stability, statistics, central bank operations, etc. look ahead, technical assistance continue intensify country progress towards align eu regulation directives. also joint vienna institute, co-sponsored oenb, play crucial role offer train opportunity staff central bank region. the recent enlargement ten new member states, well progress accession negotiation bulgaria romania decision begin negotiation croatia serve powerful reminder enlargement eu remain ongoing process. however, country region, matter far already travel road towards eu, time complacency. clearly, speed south eastern european country progress towards accession eu depend policy followed. it culture stability exercise responsibility economic policy-making crucial ingredient achieve bright prospect lie ahead region. 4 bi review 72/2004 toshihiko fukui: overall review bank japan’s conduct monetary policy statement mr toshihiko fukui, governor bank japan, concern bank’s semiannual report currency monetary control committee financial affairs, house councillors, tokyo, 28 october 2004. * * * introduction the bank japan submit semiannual report currency monetary control second half fiscal 2003 diet june 2004. i please opportunity present overall review bank’s conduct monetary policy. i. development japan’s economy japan’s economy continue recover. overseas economies, one factor behind recovery, maintain expansion, although decelerate somewhat high growth far. in unite states, growth private consumption decelerate due partly rise crude oil prices. the pace increase number employee also slow compare early spring. however, appear momentum economic expansion maintained, since corporate profit business fix investment increasing. east asian economies, particularly chinese economy, continue grow relatively fast. amid development overseas economies, japan’s export production rise trend, albeit slightly slow pace, lead improvement corporate profit expansion business fix investment. this virtuous cycle factor behind current economic recovery. another factor behind economic recovery considerable progress make deal structural element excessive capital stock, debt, labor corporate sector, vulnerability financial system, delay recovery japanese economy. a result progress adjustments, corporate profit increase substantially employment situation improving. look forward, japan’s economy expect continue recover ongoing expansion overseas economy ease structural adjustment pressure japan, although attention pay factor effect significant rise crude oil price domestic overseas economy development global it-related demand. on price front, domestic corporate good price rise due strengthen home abroad price commodity crude oil improvement supply demand conditions. consumer price (excluding fresh food, nationwide basis), contrast, continue fall slightly year-on-year basis partly increase productivity restraint labor cost firm absorb effect rise commodity prices. the money market remain stable overall background bank’s provision ample liquidity. in capital markets, long-term interest rate rise somewhat toward middle 2004, move around 1.5 percent recently. stock price generally firm ongoing economic recovery. the environment corporate finance become accommodative whole, although remain severe firm high credit risks. the lend attitude private bank become accommodative, lend attitude financial institution perceive firm improving. the pace decline credit demand private sector become somewhat moderate. under circumstances, rate decline lend private bank basically diminishing. moreover, fund-raise environment firm capital market cp corporate bond remain favorable, amount outstanding cp corporate bond issue continue previous year’s level. bi review 72/2004 1 ii. conduct monetary policy the bank conduct quantitative ease policy outstanding balance current account hold bank operate target. in accordance current target range outstanding balance “around 30 35 trillion yen,” bank provide ample liquidity money market. the bank also make commitment maintain quantitative ease policy year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi; exclude fresh food, nationwide basis) register zero percent high sustainable basis. the bank’s commitment contribute stabilize market participants’ projection future interest rates, thus market interest rate stable. in situation, firm able raise fund low interest rates. the commitment’s positive effect interest rate economy strengthen corporate profit increase economic recovery. with policy effect mind, bank firmly maintain quantitative ease policy commitment base cpi. the bank make effort make credit intermediation market diversify efficient monetary ease effect permeate throughout economy, effort expect improve japanese financial capital market long term. a part efforts, bank start purchase asset-backed security (abss) summer 2003, total amount abs purchase date reach around 1.5 trillion yen. in addition, may 2004, view enhance liquidity japanese government security (jgs) markets, bank introduce facility temporarily provide markets, secondary source, jgss hold bank market participant experience difficulty secure specific issues. the bank make wide range effort improve infrastructure financial market continue so. iii. purchase stock hold commercial bank the bank purchase stock hold commercial bank since november 2002 reduce risk stock price fluctuation might impact negatively upon business management individual financial institutions, potentially result instability financial system whole. this program wind end september 2004. the accumulate total stock purchase bank amount 2,018.0 billion yen. conclusion japan’s economy expect continue recover ongoing expansion overseas economies. to ensure recovery become sustainable overcome deflation, bank consider essential wide range economic entity continue make effort revitalize economy. the bank determine firmly support japan’s economy financial side maintain monetary ease commitment base cpi even situation economy continue recover. 2 bi review 72/2004 jean-pierre roth: life two-headed monetary system - swiss experience speech mr jean-pierre roth, chairman govern board swiss national bank, 50th anniversary bank israel, jerusalem, 29 november 2004. * * * 1. introduction it almost common-place state birth euro january 1, 1999 milestone process european integration. give national sovereignty monetary matter without doubt bold move historical proportions. it long last economic political consequences. it mean promote efficiency, transparency, growth. the creation single currency also act catalyst towards european integration. moreover, really i would like focus today, creation euro change world’s monetary landscape. i believe one say without fear exaggeration lead new international monetary order. country israel switzerland, situate periphery euro area, affect well. i would like share experience regard, i would interest know extent find apply country too. 2. our pre-euro worry quite frankly, colleague i swiss national bank somewhat worry introduction euro. although fully appreciate benefit switzerland would draw creation euro term increase transparency low transaction costs, also quite concern possible risks. three come mind. first, fear swiss franc might bumpy ride. in past, whenever dollar attack, international investor turn attention german mark swiss franc. their status safe-haven currency mean time turbulence foreign exchange market would move well beyond economic fundamental could justify. in fact, swiss franc often reveal tendency appreciate even german mark, phenomenon generally attribute relative narrowness swiss financial markets. now german mark gone, wouldn’t attention focus almost exclusively currency? would mean dollar crisis franc would bear even adjustment past? even frightful, would happen euro attack? the last thing need franc become first currency line fire, something like lighten rod international monetary system. a second apprehension might become difficult future conduct autonomous monetary policy. switzerland, together liechtenstein, would totally surround single monetary zone. a know, switzerland, like israel, small open economy, i emphasize word small open. indeed, widely open. nearly half national income generate abroad, european union far large foreign partner. about two third export head direction, one best customer eu. we also small, mean although significant impact rest europe, expose foreign shocks, whether real monetary nature. our activity highly correlate eurozone. under conditions, would snb still position conduct independent monetary policy? would realistic expect snb follow course deviate one set european central bank, would snb force shadow action ecb? the question independent monetary policy matter safeguard appeal prestige job swiss central bankers. the stake much higher. for one thing, even swiss activity economic condition generally highly correlate event europe, correlation le perfect. our economy, although offer many similarity germany, france, italy, also specific features. thus, switzerland well endow physical human capital. a consequence, return capital relatively low wage comparatively high, particularly unskilled labour. we thus tend specialize capital intensive high-value add activities. external shock tend impact u way quite bi review 72/2004 1 rest europe. moreover, also cope home-brewed shocks. it reason eager keep autonomous monetary policy. furthermore, market become convince future snb’s action would simply mimic ecb, would rapidly force convergence swiss nominal interest rate eurozone. our real interest rate might remain low while, give relatively large supply physical capital, tendency towards equalization would nonetheless set in. what might mean u high rate inflation time, together collapse asset price domestic gross capital formation. a mixture high interest rate high, sticky wage would harmful economy. the third fear sometimes expressed, although i must say i rather sceptical myself, euro would gradually render swiss franc obsolete. with many trade firm bill pay supplier euros, might tendency adopt euro generally account well domestic transactions. some people even go far predict long wage would pay euros. shops, hotel restaurant would rapidly force accept euros, visitor abroad would long see need convert euro francs. eventually swiss consumer would follow suit, switzerland would de facto integrate eurozone. more national pride would hurt “euroization” swiss economy. for one thing, development would entail loss seigniorage income. with monetary base 40 billion franc (26 billion euros), 5’700 franc (3’700 euros) per person, seigniorage case far trivial. but even seriously, loss monetary autonomy cause displacement swiss franc euro would prevent snb create liquidity case need. to large extent, fear reflect fundamental debate fix versus flexible exchange rates. which foreign exchange regime appropriate give country particular time? although view universally shared, many economist argue favour corner solution: either purely flexible exchange rates, rigidly fix ones. intellectually, i tend share view, except i would like take one step further: either purely flexible exchange rates, monetary union. rigidly fix exchange rate constitute polar case. in fact, accumulate many drawbacks. thus, fix exchange rate never know fix long. fix exchange rate fix day change, change, tend brutally atmosphere crisis, pain, tears. no, i believe one really aim exchange rate irrevocably fixed, one go way, is, one opt monetary union. a long two currency distinct, relative price might change. so option boil choice purely flexible exchange rate monetary union. needle say, since switzerland member european union, join eurozone option worth discuss stage. far second best solution, fix franc euro would rather cumulate negatives, suppress monetary independence, and, time, expose u danger speculative attack set u up, back wall, alone market. 3. our post-euro experience what happen since january 1999 prove reassuring. our bad fear materialize, indeed, ways, outcome even much positive could hop for. first, let briefly sum experience regard fear “euroization” loss monetary degree freedom. a expected, swiss franc crowd euro. sure, euro circulate switzerland, like swiss franc use neighbour france, germany, italy, phenomenon remain marginal, exceed use french francs, german marks, italian lira pre-euro world. this surprise for, even though euro (and dollar matter) happily accept swiss shops, cafés, hotels, exchange rate usually unattractive change give swiss francs. shopkeeper restaurant owner business provide financial services, foreign tourist still good change euro bank use credit cards. true, swiss firm use euro extensively, much bill european currency, even switch account euros. some natural hedge take place well, although clear 2 bi review 72/2004 efficient is. it worth point out, however, large firm much bill account dollars, others continue quite happily use swiss franc. the fact “euroization” take place really surprise us. there example small independent currency survive neighbourhood much large monetary zones. the example canadian dollar come mind. the loonie float past several decades, serve canada rather well. more generally, nothing gain one currency transaction purposes. much benefit allow one get around double coincidence want get lose several currency circulate simultaneously. “dollarization” occur country hyperinflation threatens. this happen switzerland long establish record price stability. the fear lose monetary independence clearly misplace well. over past six year snb repeatedly demonstrate act decisively independently, often well ecb. give openness, switzerland badly affect world slowdown couple year ago. the situation make bad fact main trade partner, germany, severely hit, compound difficulties, worldwide capital overhang adverse effect exporters, many specialize production capital goods. exceptional circumstance require extraordinary measures. from march 2001 april 2003, snb cut interest rate aggressively, low target range reference rate, three-month libor, 325 basis points, 3.5% 0.25%. and early year, improve performance economy allow u take interest-rate ease back, even though ecb budge. what stability external value swiss franc? here, i must say, fear prove unfounded, reality turn much favourable could hop for. the exchange rate swiss franc euro end much steady expected, fact even steady use german mark, mention french franc italian lira. over past six years, real exchange rate move within relatively narrow band little five percentage point wide. except immediate after-september-11 period, swiss franc appreciate significantly, external value franc largely reflect economic fundamentals. in fact, even post 9/11 safe-haven effect relatively mild compare experience past, seventy eighties, instance. but vigilance essence. recent foreign exchange market development show highly turbulent time swiss franc come upward speculative pressure. this may interfere domestic monetary strategy eventually trigger corrective policy actions. 4. a new international monetary order i truly believe one make case introduction euro bring new international monetary order, produce element stability benefit many countries, europe’s immediate neighbours, nation around globe. a seen, movement dollar/mark exchange rate magnify far swiss franc concern past, much dampen since birth euro. when euro depreciate dollar first, swiss franc too, much less degree. and later, euro recover dollar, franc appreciate well, less extent. in order words, effective exchange rate le affected, movement dollar offset, least extent, movement euro opposite direction. it seem phenomenon benefit switzerland, also many country independent currencies, unite kingdom, canada, australia, new zealand, singapore, norway. i would curious know experience respect. this evolution might last. perhaps outcome chance, sufficiently persistent past year noticeable. maybe one day bright graduate student write thesis topic, confirm falsify hypothesis, meantime let outline i think good reason believe stability international monetary system enhance creation euro. i think anybody would argue world whole today make optimal currency area. our planet yet ready single currency. we therefore bind live world n, n great one, currencies. for second half 20th century, live one dominate bi review 72/2004 3 currency, u.s. dollar, many, le important currencies, british pound, japanese yen, german mark, swiss franc, on. moreover, unite state largely close economy, could regard fluctuation external value dollar benign neglect. of course, countries, rather small quite open, fully expose turbulence foreign exchange markets, much could it. there several episode internal stability dollar threaten well, u.s. inflation rate double digits. the flight stable currency put considerable pressure these. today, arrival euro change landscape important ways. first, new kid block, euro command attention respect. in economic size, eurozone nearly rival unite states. there obvious alternative dollar instrument portfolio diversification. if investor doubt dollar, need long rush swiss franc, euro fine. second, eurozone, although quite extent unite states, largely close economy. movement euro far le devastate movement similar magnitude swiss franc german mark. the euro much capable currency take role shock absorber u.s. dollar. the eurozone, ways, large close economy world need counterweight u.s. economy. be intent chance, new, two-headed international monetary system, far freak nature, harmonious balance construct benefit small open economies, least switzerland. there third reason arrival euro change landscape fundamentally prove beneficial stability international monetary system, competition. even though u.s. monetary authority mandate specifically direct price stability ecb does, investor choice vote feet. thus pressure unite state deliver price stability well. i find unlikely experience time soon double digit
