executive director prudential policy international business & diplomatic exchange 2020 annual conference, london 10 march 2020 i would like thank matthew willison, hugh burns, nicolo fraccaroli david swallow assistance prepare remark 2 a lot change since last global financial crisis. bank much resilient. the pra authorise 18 new bank past five years, bank pipeline authorised. the role non-banks market-based finance growing. and digitalisation transform number financial services. in spite changes, fundamental market failure justify need prudential regulation remain. this financial firm take action create “negative externalities” – jargon someone make bet hurt innocent bystander go wrong. and case “systemic” negative externality hurt economy large, great financial crisis remind us. equally, market failure need deal manner introduce friction hurt innovation long-term productivity economic growth. prudential regulation deal effectively market failure underpin appropriate institutional structure: set clear responsibility enshrine law set objective prudential regulation how, regulates, detail prudential regulation sit. but ideal institutional structure would allow u update, change simplify rules? this timely question. le month half ago,  exit eu. the implementation period due last end year. while implementation period, government regulator continue onshore new financial regulation standard come eu take effect year. and end implementation period,  leave complex set eu law regulation onshored way replicate rather unique way eu – supranational institution – area financial services. the technical detail prudential requirement sit disperse variety places: primary legislation, range statutory instruments, on-shored bind technical standards, pra rule guidance. this ‘patchwork’ naturally make framework difficult firm navigate – particularly small firm limit resource devote compliance. it partly reason previous chancellor philip hammond announce 2019 spring statement hm treasury review post-exit regulatory framework. this review include ‘the need ensure financial stability deliver effective regulatory framework, responsiveness necessary dynamic open financial service sector appropriate level democratic accountability’.1 the first stage review, focus regulatory coordination, launch july 2019.2 ultimately, design post-eu regulatory framework parliament decide due course. 1httpsassets.publishing.service.gov./government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785618/wms_final_commons.. 2 for detail review, see

last year sam wood set set principle future  regulatory framework adhere. this speech build principle propose ideal framework perspective achieve bank england’s objectives. 3 it look whether exist empirical evidence, include new research carry recently colleague bank, support framework. ideal feature institutional structure prudential regulation sam woods’ six principle regulation show figure 1. in build framework, i start map principle three ideal feature regulation also depict figure. the first feature structure need dynamism. by this, i mean adjustment make regulation time incorporate update international standard timely manner, include adjust unintended consequence regulation. for example international standard design certain business model mind, reflect advance new technology reflect new risk opportunities. i speak length elsewhere benefit dynamism, dwell here.4 the second feature institutional structure time consistency. time consistency perhaps best understand describe opposite, time inconsistency. public policy suffer time inconsistency conflict policymaker’s short-term incentive long-term incentives. in context prudential regulation, long run, policymaker want avoid financial crises. robust prudential standard mean achieve this. in short term, however, may benefit weaken prudential standards. for instance, government might benefit electorally result short-term boost credit supply. there empirical evidence happen practice.5 but long-term consequence always act short-term incentive unstable financial system. the benefit time consistency long recognise monetary policy. finally, structure need legitimacy. 3 ://.bankofengland../speech/2019/sam-woods-ubs-20th-annual-financial-institutions-conference-lausanne. 4 see

burns, nicolo fraccaroli david swallow assistance prepare remark 4 to achieve this, regulatory authority need give mandate. a mandate provide regulator legitimacy two ways. first, ensure democratic control shape regulatory regime; e.g., objective objective prudential regulation, type firm scope, issue regulator must regard make policy. second, make possible hold regulator account. figure 1: link principle ‘stylish’ regulation ideal feature institutional structure prudential regulation alternative model institutional structure there broadly four alternative model institutional structure prudential regulation. the first model prudential regulation specify primary legislation. the approach prudential regulation eu take example model since example regulatory requirement mostly specify capital requirement regulation capital requirement directive. this mean many technical detail make prudential regulation include legislation. this would include, instance, mathematical formula use calculate risk weights. i would like thank matthew willison, hugh burns, nicolo fraccaroli david swallow assistance prepare remark 5 this model provide legitimacy legislation prudential regulation set pass parliament. it also time consistent, deviation regulatory standard would require change legislation. but unlikely dynamic way prudential regulation could adjust response unintended consequence new risk arise change primary legislation, take time happen. it typically take nine month issue new pra rule – time include policy development, cost benefit analysis, process public consultation, approval prudential regulation committee. in contrast, process make change primary legislation  – include debate committee house parliament – require find parliamentary time legislation, parliamentary time secured, take long year complete. find parliamentary time easy task, especially purpose legislation carry technical amendment financial service rules. public official need compete attention important public-policy issue parliament government must deal find parliamentary slot parliament dissolve elections, legislation get delay next queen’s speech. for example, past six months, event delay passage bill necessary implement final element basel 3 (so-called basel 3.1). by contrast, financial regulator’s task solely focus deliver maintain rule fit purpose regulate sector – competition initiative process timetable provide certainty industry. in second model, prudential regulatory-setting power could lie government ministers. this model would dynamic government would able adjust prudential regulation. it would legitimate since government directly accountable parliament ultimately electorate. but may time consistent create possibility prudential regulation influence unduly electoral cycle, deem happen monetary policy prior central bank independence. alternatively third model, power could give independent regulatory body. this model likely ensure prudential regulation dynamic time-consistent. an expert regulator would able identify implement necessary dynamic adjustments, and, reputation reasons, would incentive maintain prudential standard provide avoid industry capture. but, absent accountability mechanism enhance it, would lack legitimacy. in summary, model lack one ideal feature institutional structure prudential regulation. i would like thank matthew willison, hugh burns, nicolo fraccaroli david swallow assistance prepare remark 6 the fourth model independent regulatory body clear mandate set primary legislation clear set accountability mechanism parliament. this model combine benefit expert regulator adjust prudential regulation dynamically, objective incentivises maintain prudential standards, use mandate accountability mechanism ensure legitimacy. table 1 summarise degree four model posse three ideal feature institutional structure prudential regulation. in theory least, fourth model preferable because, unlike models, posse three ideal features. table 1: comparison alternative model institutional structure prudential regulation model dynamic? time-consistent? legitimate? primary legislation x √ √ government √ x √ regulator √ √ x regulator + clear mandate +accountability mechanism parliament √ √ √ there plenty precedent institutional structure prudential regulation, include . the financial service market act 2000, good know fsma, establish regulator form fsa specify regulator’s objective responsibilities. the detail regulatory rules, however, set fsa handbook, write act. follow financial crisis, model prudential regulation  develop establishment financial policy committee (fpc) prudential regulation authority (pra). the mandate fpc pra set primary legislation: fpc responsible protect enhance overall stability  financial system; pra’s primary objective promote safety soundness regulate firm contribute secure appropriate degree protection policyholders. but importantly, mandate fpc pra ensure factor long-term productivity economic growth take account set policy. the fpc must pursue financial stability objective without cause serious harm wide economy medium i would like thank matthew willison, hugh burns, nicolo fraccaroli david swallow assistance prepare remark 7 long term. in words, fpc must avoid ‘stability graveyard’.6 and, fpc also secondary objective, subject pursuit primary objective: support economic policy government. the pra also important secondary objective facilitate effective competition, must regard set regulatory principles, include desirability sustainable economic growth. furthermore, chancellor write regular letter fpc prudential regulation committee, set government’s economic policy make recommendation discharge functions. importantly, pra take account fpc’s view financial stability set microprudential policy. to give example work practice – 2015 fpc set optimal overall level  capital requirements, balance financial stability economic

member executive board deutschebundesbank, representation state hessen european union, brussels, 11march 2020.* * *1 introductionladies gentlemen,when i look current state european bank supervision general, i happy withwhat i see. even though single supervisory mechanism (ssm) launch around sixyears ago, already hard imagine world without it.while certainly always room improvement, european supervisor tool andthe scope necessary safeguard efficiency stability individual financial institutionsand financial system whole.besides structural observation, i would like briefly address bank supervisorydevelopments relate coronavirus.at present, indication function financial bank system ingermany finance real economy risk.since financial crisis 2008 make significant progress. qualitative quantitativerequirements capital liquidity strengthen substantially. in aggregate, capitaland liquidity buff bank much high twelve year ago. indeed, framework forbanks’ capital contain several „breathing“ buff capital conservation buffer(ccob), countercyclical capital buff (ccyb) pillar 2 guidance (p2g). these bufferswould available cushion severe economic downturn.if necessary, supervisory system provide sufficient leeway flexibility react apotential worsen economic data. however, i strictly oppose measure woulddistort correct assessment risks.while current situation certainly challenging, doesn’t change overall assessmentthat european supervisor well equip deal it. however, come back mystructural considerations, shouldn’t take situation granted. indeed, look severalstructural developments, i believe supervisory capability need protected. andplease allow extend scope speech somewhat beyond title.i see three development could restrict supervisory capabilities:brexit subsequent restructure financial relations;bigtech company increase role bank sector;and potentially lenient approach implement basel iii.my message today that, order ensure strong effective supervision go forward,regulators legislator need protect achievements.now i would like discus three development could affect supervisorysphere. i start brexit.2 brexit subsequent restructure financial relation 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech european supervisors, include bundesbank, long warn risk ability tosupervise could arise bank relocate brexit.there risk bank move  eu-27 could try obtain europeanlicences open small, letterbox-style branch europe limit personnel andlimited relevance day-to-day business group.consequently, institution would enter european financial market without actually beingpart european supervisory sphere without sufficiently independent theirparent companies.however, thank clear stance european supervisors, risk materialised.early on, ssm make clear empty shell company would tolerate europe. itwas point every occasion financial institution would grant licence ifcritical function business, include risk management, carry continentand therefore within jurisdiction european supervisors.as long ssm continue resolutely implement zero-tolerance policy empty shellcompanies, financial institution operate european licence pose threat ourability supervise.instead, i concern financial institution don’t european licence.so far, around 300 institution grant new licence result brexit. however, atotal 5,500 financial firm register london. this mean majority nodesire obtain european licence all.some try rely passive provision services. although investment bank inlondon allow actively acquire customer eu-27 brexit, actfreely european customer go london. however, brexit, financial intermediaries,i.e. bank base london, long subject eu rule supervision.financial tie london eu-27 strong. one-third eu’s capitalmarket activity take place london: 85 percent interest rate swap trade london; 37percent global foreign exchange trade conduct london, 11 percent iscarried eu. in fact, half european central bank’s bond purchase carry outin london.while financial tie remain close, regulatory tie cut brexit. whether europeanbanking regulations, regulation money laundering, consumer protection – willessentially risk suspended.financial institution highly relevant finance european economy providingfinancial service european customer beyond scope supervisory andregulatory powers.some british policymakers already voice opinion london could use regulatorydifferences advantage future.this could see announcement rule bank may softened, wouldmean bank system whole would stable ought eurules.let u clear: this could announcement reap benefit regulatory arbitrage andstart new race bottom. in words, future financial stability also depend parton behaviour supervisor legislator london – even time crisis. this amatter concern me. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech the solution clear: need strengthen eu financial centre. we need anindependent capital supply channel global markets. eu policy never aimedtowards goal far. there industrial strategy financial sector. it wasnever necessary, everything need london.the financial market continent strong, strong enough. highly controversialprojects bank union, include deposit guarantee scheme, must therefore re-examined; take even great strategic importance brexit.only eu succeed strengthen financial market thereby reduce itsdependence london european regulator supervisor continue able ensureeffective stable financial market eu.3 bigtech company increase role bank sectorthe second potential threat supervisory capability also come new entrant thebanking sector. i talk fintech bigtech company well critical third-partyproviders cloud services.these new entrant world finance bank put traditional value chainsof bank sector question. establish bank fully recognise magnitudeand gravity threat.however, le prominent topic discussion challenge development pose forregulators – supervisory sphere. we must therefore ask ourselves: could newplayers enter financial sector without come supervisory sphere well?if take rather simple example bigtech fintech company act fully fledgedbank right away, nothing worry about. in scenario, company would needto ask licence accompany proper supervision.however, new challenger don’t usually enter financial sector legal term found abank that’s slightly digitalised. instead, tend deconstruct traditional value chain ofbanking offer select services, verification customer identities, creditbrokering, account information services.in case, activity carry need assess base exist regulation andthen supervise accordingly. the activity define entity ecosystem belicenced supervise – way.in many case fintech company (as well bigtech company cloud service providers)cooperate establish banks, example mean outsource arrangements.this development pose various challenge supervisors:first, outsource arrangement become complex, mean assess howthe supervise institution manage highly complex task supervisors.second, recent report requirement still implemented, supervisorscurrently find challenge ass potential concentration risks.third, currently direct obligation third-party provider (including multi-client serviceproviders) comply regulatory requirement impose banks.the go requirement relate proper business organisation, include theadequacy effectiveness risk management. 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech currently, outsource institution ensure third-party provider comply therelevant requirements. however, might quite challenge practice. the question iswhether might need direct regulatory requirement critical third-party provider thefuture.further problem arise outsource arrangement business model general arecross-border different regulatory requirement lead inconsistent classification abusiness different jurisdictions. international harmonisation respective rule well asinternational cooperation among supervisor key deal cases.in eu, already come long way late revision european bankingauthority (eba) outsource guidelines, harmonise requirement across eu. itwill improve information supervisor assess potential concentration risks. and itclarifies supervisory expectation towards outsource contracts.national implementation guideline underway. the next step collaborateregarding appropriate oversight framework monitor critical service provider line withthe joint advice european supervisory authorities.but regard activity bigtech company financial sector – notably theannouncement global “stablecoins” recent month – eu must continue push forstrong international cooperation order ensure consistent comprehensive supervisionand oversight bigtech-driven ecosystems.globally, work need term harmonisation. the basel committee bankingsupervision (bcbs) play central role here.in fact, committee meet two week ago discus future priorities, structure itsprocesses. without go much detail, i say committee well aware thechallenges pose new competitor bank system. the committee decidehow define scope work go forward. the traditional understand playersbelong bank sector thus subject bank regulation might befuture-proof.4 a potentially lenient approach implement basel iiilet’s turn third example: basel iii.while basel iii finalised, european implementation not. the basel iii finalisation package,which second last part overall reform package, still need implement inseveral jurisdictions. in eu, await proposal european commission thenext months.the reform already face headwinds, especially since estimation european bankingauthority last year predict basel iii significant impact capital requirement forsome eu banks.since – – financial industry call lenientimplementation reforms, include proposal clear deviation baselframework.following proposal would weaken financial stability eu – there’s question aboutthat. but would also weaken supervisory firepower.to job effectively, supervisor need strong set rules. a strong set rule needslegitimacy. the international consistency bank regulation basel committee hasachieved contribute tremendously legitimacy. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech it provide international level play field, thereby quash argument regulationcreates competitive disadvantage.unilaterally terminate common understand would put legitimacy successfulinternational framework risk.its credibility would also weaken basel framework, base lessonsfrom last financial crisis, call question national implementation stage.in long run, le stringent implementation basel iii would certainly limit supervisorycapacity. that’s important european legislator don’t pick proposal forintroducing loophole basel iii reforms.i would like spell clear warn respect: do deviate fundamentally theagreement accepted!besides potential loopholes, another aspect bank regulation limitsupervisory capacity: regulation use tool non-financial stability objectives.this occasionally happen political goal financial stability pursue throughfinancial regulation. example call introduce green support esg factor intobanking regulation well exist factor support sme infrastructure funding.to clear: politician function legislator every right pursue certain policygoals central banker supervisor try prevent so.but obligation sound alarm political goal undermine supervisorycapabilities thus make difficult u job assign do. when risk-oriented financial regulation use tool pursue political goals, supervisory activitiestake back seat political considerations.for implementation basel iii european bank regulation general, mean thatregulation must remain fully risk-oriented sufficiently principle-based. therefore, animplementation adhere strictly basel rule crucial.at first glance, overly prescriptive rule like apply certain adjustment factor capitalrequirements might seem delineate supervisory framework clearly. but, reality,they replace supervisory judgement sweep judgements, thereby limit supervisorypowers.5 conclusionladies gentlemen,i discuss three development threaten supervisory sphere: brexit, bigtechcompanies, lenient approach implement basel iii.to protect supervisory sphere, follow measure call for:the ssm continue resolutely implement zero-tolerance policy empty shellcompanies. the eu strengthen europe financial centre reduce itsdependence london.both eu internationally, requirement context outsource typesof cooperation bank non-banks harmonise further. we also needto ass extent rule apply directly third-party providers, push forstrong international cooperation effectively supervise cross-border financial ecosystems.the eu fully implement basel iii resist call introduce loopholes. it keep 5 / 6bis central bankers' speech regulation risk-oriented

25 february 2020.* * *introductiongood afternoon. thank much invite today share think howtechnological innovation transform world money payments.technology certainly change every aspect life. people work, shop stay touchwith differently even 10 year ago.technology also change way canadian pay things. digital payment form ofdebit, credit prepay card commonplace. we also see mobile payment likeapple pay google pay, well ability send money email. there even limiteduse cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.the bank canada look carefully money payment evolving. this isbecause one key public policy objective help ensure canadian use theirpreferred method payment confidence.new technology payment system mean new opportunity benefit consumers,businesses financial institutions. but also raise potential new risk ourfinancial system.in remark today, i want talk bank canada respond evolvingenvironment.and part response involve look whether case could—or should—be make thefuture digital currency issue bank canada. so i share contingencyplanning eventuality.today’s payment ecosystemlet’s start basic regard current payment ecosystem.most think money today consist bank deposits. and payments—whether debit, credit, direct transfer cheque—involve transfer fund banksor financial institutions.such transfer support payment systems—the hardware software allow anyfinancial institution transfer fund another. in canada, system move $200billion every business day.the bank canada play distinct role payments. this payment onefinancial institution another finally settle transfer fund theiraccounts bank canada.the bank also responsible oversee regulate whole system.in addition, design, issue distribute bank notes—the cash canadian physicallyexchange others purchase good services.so let’s talk cash. 1 / 8bis central bankers' speech cash old simple payment technology. it stand test time hasseveral important advantages.first foremost, cash safe. it legal tender relatively stable value widelyaccepted payment.it also establish confidence bank system. a bank’s customer reassure that,any time want, convert deposit cash.furthermore, cash universally accessible. anyone use it, include people don’t havebank accounts. perhaps surprisingly, then, cash important may facechallenges access alternative payment methods—such homeless live inremote communities.cash resilient—it work even computer system go power failure.it private—you buy everyday good service without reveal identity yourpersonal financial information.cash also preserve element competition financial system, provide cheap andreliable alternative credit debit cards.all said, cash also limitations.it suitable relatively low-value payment obvious security risk ofcarrying around large volume cash.and cannot use make purchase remotely.with background mind, i would like discus issue canada’s paymentecosystem currently facing.changes challengesrecent advance technology offer opportunity improve core payment infrastructure.we see retail level, contactless “tap go” payments, mobile bank andother innovations.the structure economy also changing, transaction increasingly take placeonline.partly reflect innovations, see steady decline use cash retailtransactions.in 2017 bank canada survey ask canadian pay good services,respondents say use cash one-third transactions—compared withmore half decade ago.and 1 10 canadian claim entirely “cashless.”in countries, sweden norway, use cash decline level wheremerchants find costly accept cash, bank scale back processingservices. i’ll talk late maintain access cash, particularly those“unbanked” “underbanked” member society.in addition trend drive mainly technology, globalization put spotlight oncross-border payments.1 2 / 8bis central bankers' speech canadian family member country often face high cost long delay insending money. business face similar drawback pay good service theypurchase outside canada.these friction cost motivate private digital currency aspire make easy andcheaper move fund around.we familiar explosion cryptocurrencies past years. bitcoin andsimilar digital asset introduce hope become money future.that hasn’t happened, ever likely to. transact cryptocurrencies bitcoin isjust expensive, purchase power unstable.a recent potentially impactful innovation so-called “stablecoins,” designedto maintain stable value term currency commodity. in cases, backed—either fully part—by currency holdings.compared early form cryptocurrencies, stablecoins good prospect forwidespread adoption—and, correspondingly, great potential transform world ofmoney payments.the prominent example libra, stablecoin facebook, along association ofother companies, plan launch.libra would run exist message platform strong brand recognition. this would giveit potential reach billion people—including many little access bank orfinancial services.it’s tough predict libra ever live promise even come existence. but agood example transformative technology affect bank need respond thefuture money.building modern ecosystemso let talk key area bank canada focus order adaptto fast-moving world payments.first, work make sure canadian wish use bank note continue todo so.we work financial institution maintain state-of-the-art distribution system forcash. this help ensure accept cash remain cost-effective merchants.some jurisdiction adopt prescriptive approaches, include law requiringacceptance cash point sale. these approach cost benefit thatshould examined.a second area focus bank’s support payment canada’s payment modernizationefforts. the goal provide consumers, business financial institution modern,fast convenient payment system.one excite component project construction fast, always-on payment systemcalled real-time rail (rtr).this system design build block meet consumers’ payment need todayand future.2 3 / 8bis central bankers' speech base this, may imagine pay grocery pick shelf. or orderingand pay favourite shawarma truck tap phone code menu.the bank work payment canada stakeholder like interac ensure rtr isresilient promote competition innovation canadian payment ecosystem. to complement rtr, government explore open banking—also know consumer-directed finance. the intent open bank give customer great control financialdata safe access wide range financial services, reduce costs.this would help foster innovative competitive financial system.the government also look implement new retail payment oversight framework thatwill require payment service provider beef risk management practices, betterprotect end-users losses.the bank tap regulatory authority monitor compliance, includingmaintaining public registry regulate payment service providers.a third area focus international one—cross-border payments.the bank canada collaborate bank england monetary authority ofsingapore identify “pain points” cross-border payments. work topic iscontinuing domestic international forums, include g20.it go without say improvement move money internationally would need tomaintain vital safeguards—such know-your-customer regulations—that detect deterexploitation system criminal terrorist purposes.a fourth important area focus private digital currencies, tout asthe answer challenge cross-border payments.while future libra stablecoins uncertain, private digital currency globalphenomenon. a global effort require understand wide-ranging implication ensurethe regulatory framework fit purpose.to end, bank canada please work financial stability board,alongside 23 jurisdictions, identify supervisory regulatory issue pose fintechinnovations. we hold fast principle innovation, competition consumer choice good,and disruption enemy.but essential understand manage risk individuals, business entirefinancial system arise product offer public.contingency plan central bank digital currencyall lead final area focus.in context issue i’ve raise today, increase discussion around acentral bank digital currency (cbdc). we think digital version cash.digital currency design provide benefit cash—safety, universal access,resilience, privacy competition—but electronic format could use onlinetransactions point sale, use mobile phone special card device.34 4 / 8bis central bankers' speech it would truly equivalent cash.today release comprehensive document outline great detail ourrecommendations respect cbdc.i encourage visit website read thinking, i’ll share highlightswith you.we conclude compel case issue cbdc time. canadianswill continue well-served exist payment ecosystem, provide modernize andremains fit purpose. this mean that:bank note remain available canadian want use them, include marginalizedpopulations society;the canadian payment system bring date problem cross-borderpayments addressed; andan appropriate regulatory framework stablecoins private digital currency isestablished, canada globally.all said, world change quickly. the bank canada imaginescenarios would consider issue cbdc continue provide canadianswith trustworthy method payment.one scenario would ever reach tip point cash could long use forum sufficiently wide range transactions.that scenario would raise several potential concerns:payment service offer large financial institution could become game town,giving increase market power;people without adequate bank service would find even difficult participate fullyin economy;people would lose ability conduct transaction privately; andthe system could single point failure, make vulnerable computersystem breakdown power outages.of course, even shift toward cashless society automatically mean bankwould issue cbdc. that’s choice canadian elect representative wouldneed make time.a second scenario may lead consider cbdc widespread use private digitalcurrencies.this could one dominant digital currency create big tech company—a monopoly thatwould erode competition privacy pose unacceptable challenge canadian monetarysovereignty.we could also imagine one, several, private digital currency emerging. in case,consumers merchant would face assortment different method payment—reminiscent time bank canada created, country multipleissuers bank notes.in scenarios, would argument bank canada step in. the bankwould trust public institution, create official digital currency designedwith interest public top priority, commercial motive. 5 / 8bis central bankers' speech this last point important, accord poll publish week ago officialmonetary financial institution forum. more half people survey 13 countriessaid would prefer digital currency issue central bank. major internet technologycompanies rank low public confidence.beyond this, central monetary sovereignty bank’s ability conductmonetary policy preserve canadian dollar unit account—meaning thatprices quote canadian dollars. that could challenge private digital currencydenominated another currency, basket currencies, make serious inroads.next stepsso, next?while don’t know future may bring, need move forward work apotential cbdc might look like could managed, decision ever take toissue one.there many aspect consider contingency planning.how could cbdc integrate method payment yet resilient stillworks power failure, example?what business model might work? would bank try develop mainly in-house, would itmake sense partner private sector?how would cbdc work cross-border transactions?and, perhaps importantly, could ensure canadian could continue transactprivately legitimate purposes, guard illicit activity like money laundering,terrorist finance tax evasion?answering question part work. and we’re alone—a recent survey bankfor international settlement cover 66 central bank find 80 percent arecurrently engage cbdc work 10 percent likely issue cbdc within three years.we form work group central bank england, japan, european union,sweden switzerland, well bank international settlements. we use thisplatform share experience ass potential case cbdc homejurisdictions.but cbdc could launch successfully canadian want it. so consultingwith government key stakeholder province territory across canada, like ofyou audience today.we’ll also consider design feature might make cbdc attractive paymenttechnologies financial system evolve.we consult payment service provider merchant ensure business model isvalid role clear.in addition, consult various government agencies, recognize many areasrelevant cbdc outside responsibility bank canada. this includediscussions combine privacy adequate safeguard illicit use.another essential element bank would need proper legislative authority issue acbdc decision make issue one.56 6 / 8bis central bankers' speech in work, continue take holistic view across whole payment ecosystem toensure aspects—payment systems, cash future cbdc—would continue tofunction together provide canadian efficient, safe secure payment service theyneed.all undertake ensure manage risk raise cbdc decisionis ever take issue one—not bank canada also banks, payment serviceproviders end-users.conclusionin conclusion, clear technology change world around us. and cannotperfectly predict future, certainly plan contingencies. this include readyingourselves case decision make day issue bank canada digital currency.some may question would even need cbdc much moneyappears flow electronically anyway.let’s go back two scenario i present early could warrant launch cbdc.the first use physical cash reduce eliminate altogether. the second iswhere private cryptocurrencies make serious inroads.if either scenario come pass, society may well-served digital currency:that designed, issue distribute organization guide interest ofthe public good, rather profit;that safe, resilient, universally accessible private—just like cash; andthat back central bank’s balance sheet reputation preserve value ofour money.our intent would issue cbdc replace bank note charter bank deposits. thepublic still want products, support them.in fact, actively plan design new $5 bank note. the bank midst ofa wide consultation process ask canadian want portrait subject newbank note.and world changes, bank continue fulfill mandate support secure, reliableand efficient payment option benefit canadians.thank time attention afternoon, i look forward questions.i would

supervision focus ensure appropriate risk management framework inplace, rather use supervisory tool broad objectives. that is, supervisor focuson identify manage risks, microprudential macroprudential, emerge alonga transition path sustainable economy. bank supervisors, however, theposition advocate for, provide incentive for, particular policy outcome. those broaderpolicy goal

perspective, climate change introduce challenge supervisor relate timehorizon, data limitations, inherent complexity. one question get particular attentioncenters time horizon prioritization. more specifically, give many risk financialfirms face—cybersecurity, geopolitical uncertainty, credit cycle name few—and therelatively long time horizon around climate change, supervisor focus

moreover,evidence climate science suggest physical climate impact locked-in due past emissions. some investor consider assessment sustainability beintegral fiduciary responsibilities. and, i describe

absenceof formalisation; inertia technology adoption; capacity building; backward forwardlinkages; lack access credit risk capital; perennial problem delayedpayments, among others. let elaborate issues.infrastructure bottleneck competition8. notwithstanding various effort upgrade infrastructure, msme clusters, particularlythe micro enterprises, inadequately equip necessary support system notonly impede day-to-day business operation also future growth prospects. whileinfrastructure constraint one side story, i believe msmes also need theirbit improve competitiveness. they need shed inhibition adopt new technologies;accept e-payments; foster in-house innovation help manage theirbusinesses digitally compete globally. give current scenario global trade, age-old method operate business low level technology adoption deprive ofpotential economy scale. lack expertise product development, designing, packagingand market strategy due small size add pressure adapt thechanging environment around them. the strategy msmes gradually expand insize reduce dependence incentive structure provide government. theiraim eventually compete global scale.access credit formalisation9. credit play vital role development msme sector fund reasonable cost canincrease competitiveness. credit disbursal sector has, however, remain sluggishin recent periods. at aggregate level, total credit outstanding bank nbfcs tothe msme sector approximately ₹ 16.6 lakh crore end september, 2019.scheduled commercial bank account 90 per cent share total credit outstanding.10. a many msmes mainly operate informal space, assess creditworthinesscan difficult due information asymmetry, particularly respect financialperformance businesses. in absence collateral, under-writing customer oftenentails high operate cost. furthermore, due small-scale operations, msmes notable raise risk capital. they also unable take advantage governmentschemes mostly base digital infrastructure require beneficiary havesome form digital identify presence. with implementation structural reform likegst jam trinity, informal unit are, however, get integrate mainstream inrecent years.delayed payments11. a large number msmes ancillary unit cater need large industries, bothin public private sector. they often face problem delay payments, affectingtheir cash flow work capital availability. most time, delay realisation suchreceivables increase operate cycle reduce ability procure new order orfulfil exist ones. a primary survey conduct reserve bank december 2019showed 44 per cent msmes engage manufacture activity face delay inpayments. the one receive timely payment mainly belong basic metal metalproducts, engineering, construction infrastructure relate industries. on hand,delay payment low 27 per cent service sector. here transport operator 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech mostly face situations. although micro, small medium enterprise development(msmed) act, 2006 contain provision relate penalty case delay payment thebuyers, weak bargain power fear lose business prevent msmes invokethis provision.iii. expert committee msmes12. in order understand structural bottleneck factor affect performance ofthe msmes, rbi set expert committee msmes chairmanship shriu.k sinha january 2019. the committee undertake comprehensive review thesector give several recommendation economic financial sustainability themsme sector. these recommendation wide-ranging broadly relate legislativechanges;

(rxil), a. treds, andmynd solutions] license reserve bank operate platform twoyears. further, reserve bank recently allow ‘on tap’ authorization entity desirous toprovide platform treds. hence, come years, competition receivables discountingspace bind increase entry new players. this require corporates, inthe public private sector, join treds platform make system efficient.18. in 2018, government make mandatory company turnover great ₹500 crore register treds. a february 2020, 8211 msme seller wereregistered 1530 buyer participate platforms. i would appeal theassocham encourage handhold member participate treds platform.19. in union budget 2020-21, government announce app-based invoice financingproducts obviate problem delay payment msme. the mechanism may provecomplementary treds platform would alleviate problem delayedpayments.v. way forward20. a msme sector hold immense potential, need right set policy andenabling framework guide support msmes effectively handle existingproblems venture new areas. while government rbi introduceda plethora measure improve access finance promote growth sector,the small size individual unit informal nature sector continue pose challenges.21. the traditional bank lend system bank base financial statement andcollateral borrower. with increase availability data several sources, includinggstn, income tax, credit bureaus, etc., possible appraise msme loan proposalsexpeditiously due diligence online. further, help account aggregator (aa),lenders access potential borrower’s financial information single point, ofcourse, his/her consent. furthermore, emergence fintech company make itpossible ass credit worthiness msmes utilise unexplored data source asdigital transaction trails, data generate e-commerce sites, etc. some lender arecollaborating fintech company take advantage surrogate data speediercredit underwrite extend loan msme sector. these new architecture would expandthe reach credit.22. while new model beneficial unit digitally active, largesegment msme unit access credit traditional lend models. while microenterprises act start stage entrepreneurship require low investment intechnology, unit graduate small medium enterprise enhance technicalcapacity explore new market order stay competitive sustainable growth. recentpolicy effort provide enable environment facilitate msme sector seize newemerging opportunities. i must add regulator, rbi safeguard financialstability ensure wide access finance. bank player part toensure prudent lending.23. besides, rbi start launch cohort regulatory sandbox. firstsuch cohort launch november 2019 theme ‘retail payments’ spurinnovation digital payment space design test new payment service theunserved underserved segments. in due course, propose run regulatory sandbox 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech cohort focus lending. this would promote innovation msme lend segment. theproject public credit registry (pcr) fundamentally address information asymmetrythat impede access credit micro small entrepreneurs. the pcr beenenvisaged database core credit information. the registry would play crucial role inreducing credit gap segment.24. give fact msme sector contribute significantly exports, essential thatthey integrate global value chain (gvc) remain competitive offersunique opportunity become technologically digitally empowered. be part gvcwould enable msmes produce quality good service greateracceptability global market. the major challenge sector connect gvcare lack information, knowledge market quality standards. in regard, i see agreater role cooperation among stakeholders.25. let conclude reiterate industry body like assocham need extendtheir role assist msmes embrace best business practice line fast-changingbusiness environment.i wish summit assocham success centenary year.thank you.annual report, ministry msme 2018–19.report expert committee micro, small medium enterprise (chairman: u.k. sinha), june 25,2019.ministry micro, small medium enterprises, government india, september 24, 2019.annual report ministry msme 2018–19krueger, a. o.

insight initiative predecessor, lord king. the ’s macroprudential policy framework today stand shoulder ’s monetary policy framework first set 1998. in , 1971 1992, inflation high - average 9%, volatile, standard deviation 5.4%. this distort price signals, inhibit investment, damage productive potential economy, hurt least well-off. it contribute high volatile unemployment, average 7.8% standard deviation 2.8%. although value low stable inflation widely recognised, deliver prove challenging. this instrument affect inflation powerfully – monetary policy – also affect output employment, least short run. this tempt authorities, influence governments, promise low inflation future, renege order boost activity. electoral cycle reinforce predisposition. firm household begin anticipate incentives, eventually pre-empt them. this time inconsistency resolve first society choose prefer rate inflation, delegate operational responsibility monetary authority take necessary monetary action achieve objective. by “tying hands” authorities, good outcome inflation unemployment become possible. the bank england act 1998 represent comprehensive adoption insights. the act clarify bank’s responsibilities, encode mpc’s remit, grant independence bank operation monetary policy. in delegate authority independent body, act ensure bank would operate ‘constrained’ rather ‘unfettered’ discretion. it would accountable parliament operate instrument monetary policy achieve objective monetary policy, determine government. 2 · · · · · the mpc’s current monetary policy remit

could cause volatility output employment undesirable. the remit require mpc consider, balance explain short-run monetary policy trade-offs. the manner mpc optimise trade-off represent “linear-quadratic” form – set linear constraint describe behaviour economy, quadratic preference penalise deviation inflation target output potential. the relative weight policymaker place output stabilisation, relative inflation stabilisation, often denote 𝜆 – ‘lambda’. the policymaker’s objective function describe follow “loss function”: min{𝑟𝑡+𝑖}𝑖=0𝑇ℒ𝑡≡𝐸𝑡{∑𝛽𝑖[(𝜋𝑡+𝑖−𝜋∗)2+λ(𝑦𝑡+𝑖−𝑦𝑡+𝑖∗)2]𝐻𝑖=𝑜}

reconcilingthe need openness support innovation, inherent economy integratedinto world trade benefit consumers, fundamental mission guarantor andpromoters sound risk management.but also contribute two traditional channels, namely catalystand provider settlement service central bank money.a- i believe catalyst role important field retail payments. commercialbank money predominant settlement asset france, even though use banknotesand coin remain significant country, european union. this variety ofmeans payment, base settlement asset exchange time par, anadvantage i believe preserve several reasons: one hand, ofthe financial inclusion responsibility, since vulnerable population also leastbanked; also view diversify risks, event widespread failure electronicpayment systems.however, commonly believe europe risk fragmentation ofcashless mean payment dependence dominant foreign player benefitfrom effect global networks. this particularly true international payment schemesin area

february 25, 2020 introduction distinguish guests, behalf board, management staff bank, i honour delight welcome launch 2020 monetary policy statement. i extend special word welcome guest honour, honourable minister finance economic development, cabinet colleagues, member parliament distinguish guest attend event first time. we grateful make time attend launch. distinguish lady gentlemen, publication launch monetary policy statement important event bank’s calendar events, good public policy reason. it key aspect good governance, transparency accountability formulation implementation monetary policy. through statement, bank seek promote understand monetary policy framework objectives. this help guide public’s inflation 2 expectation towards convergence bank’s inflation objective and, therefore, enhance prospect sustain maintenance low, stable predictable inflation. specifically, bank us monetary policy statement instrument report inflation trajectory policy performance past year; outline convey prognosis economic policy development go forward; and, turn, prospective monetary policy response year ahead. background context in essence, statement commit bank respect role contribute macroeconomic stability. in regard, propitious 2020 launch monetary policy statement follow budget speech propose new direction policy economic management. in addition, coincidentally, bank, collaboration international monetary fund development partners, recently conclude workshop kasane “fostering diversification escape middle-income trap” botswana. the workshop benefit contribution representative countries, chile, costa rica, estonia, mauritius south korea, consider successful advance export economic diversification. 3 distinguish guests, common theme emerge recent budget speech kasane workshop; bank also fully aligned. first, botswana face challenge inclusive growth evident structural transition, historically high growth rate early year development current modest inadequate level propel economy high-income status 2036. this reflect by, indeed of, weak traction export-led industrialisation strategy shrink tradable sector and, general, narrow economic base, high unemployment rates, well relatively high level poverty income inequality, even level income prosperity increase somewhat. clearly, situation require urgent attention aspiration espouse vision 2036 desire transit high-income status realised. second, need structural reform transformation improve productivity, ease business, policy transmission impact, institutional performance leadership accountability, well economic benefit spend infrastructure development social services. third, imperative improve implementation reform initiative timely evaluation impact outcome reform well performance responsible entities. fourth, critical maintain macroeconomic balance, 4 aspect fall within bank’s statutory mandate and, therefore, cover monetary policy statement. these relate stability respect price (inflation), exchange rate financial sector. the element macroeconomic stability fiscal sustainability, eloquently cover honourable minister maiden budget speech. it would remiss me, however, i mention that, botswana rank 91 141 world economic forum 2019 global competitiveness report, rank number 1, 32 countries, macroeconomic stability pillar. honourable minister distinguish guests, reason background highlight fact bank alive development aspiration country relate challenges. furthermore, within confine role mandate, bank contribute effort address constraint diversification inclusive economic growth. in essence, focus consistently deliver specific roles, bank contribute maintenance conducive macroeconomic environment structural reform transformation initiative gain traction, potentially lead high rate growth need elevate economy high income status. 5 policy track record honourable minister, come end second decade third millennium, important reflect bank’s contribution, thus far, macroeconomic stability. after all, key role central bank, ultimately judged, extent succeed preservation value integrity national currency, pula thebe. notably, evolution monetary policy framework early 2000s result beneficial transition high volatile current low, stable predictable inflation. similarly, adoption crawl band exchange rate regime 2005 subsequent public announcement key parameters, coefficient basket currency annual rate crawl, contribute stability inflation-adjusted exchange rate. it also key success achieve inflation objective. in addition, been, broadly, sound effective bank supervision well beneficial collaboration various regulatory authority contribute stability financial sector, growth enhance support broad economic activity. a major lesson learn development reinforcement position transparency, consistency predictability policy 6 framework essential ingredient sustainable growth objective public confidence. distinguish guests, i admit, however, level development money capital market botswana need raise significantly. this view improve transmission potency macroeconomic policy great impact economic activity. a 2017, composite financial index botswana (encompassing access, efficiency depth) two third namibia, third quarter, respectively, south africa singapore. therefore, one area attend transformation agenda. within composite measures, botswana fall short international norm nearly every metric compare unfavourably peer upper-middle income countries. the nascent development interbank market stock exchange good example regard. of particular concern paucity supply high-quality corporate debt instruments, fragment credit market low level development government bond market. this situation present undue constraint risk long-term infrastructure financing, fiscal sustainability and, broadly, headwind capital market development. in countries, vibrant highly liquid government security market provide 7 source fund government spending, include local authority public sector entities. this option currently limit botswana and, therefore, development offer viable avenue cost-effective domestic resource mobilisation long-term investment fund government projects. go forward, therefore, policy consultations, involve ministry finance economic development bank, focus design transparent frequent issuance sufficient quantum domestic government security predictable arrangement that, hopefully, attract large pool participant support deficit financing, low risks. this would premise adoption strong governance architecture around public debt management, underpin country’s well-established track record prudent fiscal policy strong institutions. furthermore, give vulnerability botswana trade shocks, climate change consequent prolong droughts, need maintain sufficient fiscal external buffers. this mean build sufficient resilience afford fiscal space undertake countercyclical stabilisation necessary. the contribution bank, regard, continue judicious management foreign exchange reserve 8 preserve capital, generate return organic growth, ensure availability foreign exchange, necessary uninterrupted economic activity. monetary policy framework distinguish lady gentlemen, objective bank’s monetary policy achieve price stability, define low, stable predictable level inflation within 3 – 6 percent, medium term. monetary policy formulation also align safeguard stability financial system. in regard, price stability well conducive monetary financial condition foster mobilisation savings, productive investment, prudent allocation credit international competitiveness domestic firms. in turn, sound stable financial system critical effective transmission monetary policy signals, facilitate flow fund liquidity, well risk mitigation support economic activity. overall, therefore, conduct monetary policy attention financial stability support national objective employment creation sustainable economic growth. price financial stability also help preserve value income long-term savings, especially low income earner pensioners, le opportunity wherewithal protect income generate wealth means. 9 at juncture i will, turn, address three areas, namely, global trend influence inflation botswana; highlight conduct monetary policy, internationally home; and, finally, provide medium-term inflation outlook outline likely policy stance 2020. external economic development 2019 global gdp growth decline estimate 2.9 percent 2019 compare 3.6 percent 2018. the slowdown widespread across country regions. global economic performance sentiment negatively affect trade tension u china, well uncertain prospect brexit. in circumstances, global inflation ease 3.6 percent 2018 3.4 percent 2019. inflation subdue special draw right (sdr) countries, increase slightly 1.7 percent december 2018 2 percent december 2019. in south africa, inflation decrease 4.5 percent december 2018 4 percent december 2019. therefore, average inflation trade partner country constant 2.9 percent 2018 2019. domestic economic development 2019 domestic output expansion estimate 3.7 percent twelve month september 2019, compare 5 percent year september 2018. the low increase output 10 attributable to, main, weak performance mine sector. growth non-mining gdp also slowed, 5.1 percent year september 2018 4 percent correspond period end september 2019. inflation low bind objective range 3 - 6 percent 2019; outcome broadly consistent early projections. average inflation decrease 3.2 percent 2018 2.8 percent 2019, largely base effects. this increase administer price 2018 repeat 2019. overall, low inflation botswana context moderate domestic demand pressure benign foreign inflation. i hasten mention food price reverse 0.4 percent decrease 2018 3 percent increase 2019. the subdue pressure inflation also apparent below-trend economic activity, signify negative output gap, economy continue operate potential. however, government expenditure grow 15.4 percent 2019 compare increase 6.6 percent prior year. within this, personal emolument rise 14.4 percent, follow april 2019 public sector salary increase, would replicate major employers. nevertheless, impact inflation muted. it recognised, 11 respect, significant externalisation spend government private sector, include ready availability imports, hence moderate impact increase government expenditure wage domestic prices. the point highlight short-term impact government spend domestic demand moderate extent significant component involve infrastructure capacity development. for botswana, type spend tend import intensive. therefore, economic benefit public investment derive medium long term. at time, recent labour force survey results, statistic botswana, third quarter 2019, indicate unemployment rate 20.7 percent. this reinforce assessment below-potential performance economy, modest aggregate demand and, consequently, subdue pressure inflation. distinguish guests, component demand, growth commercial bank credit, ease marginally 7.7 percent 2018 7.6 percent 2019, drive deceleration lend businesses, 10 percent growth 2018 contraction 1.7 percent 2019. for households, annual credit growth increase 6.2 percent 2018 13.8 percent 2019, 12 context increase public sector wages. likewise, fast growth record personal loans, increase mortgage loan small 2019 compare 2018. overall, rate credit growth continue supportive economic activity, minimal risk financial stability. global monetary policy implementation 2019 honourable minister esteem guests, monetary policy implementation 2019 mix global level, response weak economic performance restrain inflation across country regions. it was, however, generally accommodative, low level interest rate continue liquidity support financial sector major economies. most central bank emerge market economy reduce policy rates, give need support economic activity. for example, close home, south african reserve bank reduce repo rate 25 basis point 6.5 percent july 2019, 6.25 percent january 2020. domestic monetary policy implementation 2019 for part, bank botswana continue conduct monetary policy forecast-based policy framework, inform response deviation inflation 13 objective range, forward-looking manner. the analysis also involve assessment divergence actual output potential output (the output gap), primary indicator direction future inflation. the forecast incorporate projection foreign inflation, exchange rate change domestic administer price taxes. in addition, bank evaluate risk associate project outlook. in determine appropriate policy response, inflation forecast consider alongside indicator financial stability economic activity, include relevant information quarterly business expectation surveys. in 2019, monetary policy conduct environment below-trend economic activity favourable medium-term inflation outlook; therefore, provide scope maintain accommodative monetary policy stance support strong output growth. hence, bank rate reduce 25 basis points, 5 percent 4.75 percent august 2019. consequently, prime lend rate commercial bank decline 6.5 percent 6.25 percent. deposit interest rate generally increase despite high level market liquidity. this seemingly paradoxical outcome explain fund structure banks, characterise competition corporate volatile institutional deposit important several commercial banks. 14 the increase market liquidity need sterilise result outstanding bank botswana certificate (bobcs) p8.6 billion december 2019, increase p8.2 billion december 2018. bobc yield decrease follow reduction bank rate. distinguish guests, i indicate last year, bank continuously evaluate monetary policy framework effectiveness and, appropriate, make changes. in 2019, bank introduce 7-day bobc main instrument conduct monetary operations, replace 14-day paper, together call ‘reserves averaging’ determination primary reserve requirement banks. this view improve efficiency liquidity management policy transmission. both measure welcome market, positive effect expected; is, good liquidity management bank commercial banks. over time expect reduce demand excess reserve hold precautionary purposes; therefore, free additional resource productive lend banks. i also please report financial stability council (fsc), whose primary mandate coordinate macro-prudential policy analysis respond threat financial stability, launch february 2019. a indicated, council comprise 15 ministry finance economic development, bank botswana, non-bank financial institution regulatory authority financial intelligence agency. the council commence work achieve three important milestones. first, publication maiden financial stability report september 2019. the report conclude botswana financial sector sound, stable resilient, even look ahead. however, continue need address market conduct governance segment industry. furthermore, outstanding matter relate effective compliance anti-money launder combat finance terrorism requirements. notwithstanding, significant progress continue make country remove financial action task force (fatf) grey list december 2020. second, council adopt macroprudential policy framework botswana, outline

• define make explicit criterion would ass tool with, also alternative policy together (e.g., fiscal policy options); • consider relative benefit cost tools, operate ‘least surprise’ basis, ensure work collaboration agreement fiscal authorities; • consider monetary policy efficacy tools, also broad consideration relate financial stability efficiency mandate; • ensure tool actually able utilised, include work important financial institution make system. recent international experience our work, outline later, inform much research recent experience internationally, highlight desirable le desirable (sometimes unanticipated) outcomes. there consequence use monetary policy – conventional unconventional – different impact different people (e.g., saver versus borrowers). these consequence become significant long interest rate remain low. evidence side-effects unconventional monetary policy emerge slowly sometimes inconclusive. what certain use unconventional policy put spotlight central bank. first, implementation question around selection tool use. for example, large scale asset purchase introduce central bank target ‘picking winners’ compare blunt interest rate instrument. we need ass asset sale central bank why. borrower saver continue impact differently per conventional monetary policy, however choice asset purchase significantly impact specific part financial market sector society. the selection criterion specific asset also need clear. there choice make public private assets, assets. a example, recently increase discussion favour ‘green’ bond bonds. 11 second, central bank also recently buy asset long duration. even stop now, asset sit central bank balance sheet long time come unless sell maturity. some asset may become impair central bank own them, create market credit risk central banks’ balance sheets. third, central bank balance sheet (which effectively government’s balance sheet) expand greatly purchase asset issue liability (see table 2 scale central bank asset purchase proportion gdp). the persistence purchase programme also far long anticipate outset, give ongoing low inflation pressures. the marginal impact interest rate new purchase reduce countries. fourth, target direct intervention often positive specific market functioning, unprecedented growth central banks’ balance sheet also unintended detrimental impacts.11 some challenge factor include scarcity bond available investor buy, squeeze liquidity asset markets, few market operator actively trading. fifth, possibly unsurprising outcome persistently low global interest rate use unconventional monetary policy tool rise asset prices. this outcome mean increase wealth some, e.g., home owner equity investor (figure 5). figure 5: global asset price source: oecd, real estate institute new zealand, rbnz. note: house price oecd member serve proxy advance economies. 11 bi (2019). ‘large central bank balance sheet market functioning’. market committee papers, october 2019. 5010015020025030050100150200250300indexindexnew zealandadvanced economieschinashareshouses201520112019201120152019 12 however, overall impact unconventional monetary policy wide wealth income equality currently unclear. some study find unconventional monetary policy, particularly large scale asset purchases, increase inequality significantly conventional monetary policy.12 other study find unconventional policy limit positive impact reduce income inequality, e.g., support income low income family support employment.13 these possible effect need consider context broad fiscal policy settings. finally, significant spill-over effect small open economy include new zealand. this primarily drive inward capital flow investor search high yield around globe. these capital inflow lead global bond yield low – include new zealand. the low import interest rate necessitate variety economic policy response across many country – include low central bank policy rate stem inflow, introduce macroprudential tool aim curb excess lending, purchase foreign asset slow upward pressure domestic currency values. at te pūtea matua undertake first two response continue meet inflation employment mandate, well mitigate risk excessive debt/lending broad financial stability (e.g., introduction use loan-to-value ratios).14 the set choice te pūtea matua the reserve bank team use international domestic experience ass full suite monetary policy tool available new zealand. today publish short document outline framework would follow use unconventional monetary policy tools.15 publish framework provide great transparency might use tools. this work prepare range potential eventualities, prediction whether additional monetary policy tool needed. table 3 outline principle would use guide use tools. 12 for example, evgendis, a., & fasianos, a.

effective low bind (the point ocr cut become ineffective), may zero. the reserve bank could consider change cash system mitigate cash hoard low deposit rate lead significant hoarding. interest rate swap an interest rate swap contract one stream future interest payment exchange another. the reserve bank could enter interest rate swap reinforce forward guidance. we would receive fix rate pay float rate financial market participants. this would reduce market interest rates. large scale asset purchase (lsaps) the reserve bank could purchase domestic government bond low interest rate contribute flatten yield curve main channel policy signal portfolio balancing. unlike ocr, lsaps would effect longer-term interest rate (2+ years), important mortgage business lending. foreign asset purchase the purchase foreign currency asset reduce nzd exchange rate and, desired, increase nzd liquidity. this could include systematic purchase foreign asset buy fix quantity set dates. term lend the provision

consider vary effectiveness, efficiency impact financial soundness. they also various stage readiness utilised. perhaps one simple mean outline tool various level usefulness refer back discussion transmission monetary policy shift ocr influence inflation employment. figure 6 expand transmission framework add new tool – namely forward guidance, interest rate swaps, term lending, large scale

inflation employment (this diagram show different channel different tool ultimately end affect inflation employment. it build monetary policy transmission mechanism show monetary policy handbook (p52)) source: rbnz. 16 in light recent international experience, key consideration are: • what optimal sequence tool monetary policy increasingly call upon stimulate economy? we near ready able implement zero slightly negative interest rate operations, forward guidance around future action standard practice us. but also must decide point use additional tool order. • what agreement need treasury reserve bank regard use balance sheet, materially different manage now? we currently work treasury finalise institutional arrangement enable u effectively use describe unconventional monetary policy tools, ever required. this include arrangement handle balance sheet implication unconventional tools. more fundamentally, also need ensure coordinate appropriate mix fiscal monetary policy response desired. • what additional policy response might need consider manage consequence low interest rate market functioning? we could consider additional macroprudential tool specific market intervention ensure liquidity credit flows. but need ass best communicate participate new zealand economy purpose actions, desire outcomes. new zealander become use terminology associate current monetary policy activities. a low ocr understand intent implication borrow lend rate and, part, level nz dollar exchange rate. we need outline could best translate activity in, example, interest rate swap market asset purchases, meaningful concept all. we need meaningful ‘shadow’ ocr concept ease discussion. to ensure operate effectively efficiently, also want ensure market participant (e.g. bank payment operators) respond appropriately use unconventional monetary policy tools. while do lot preparatory work, do. these consideration well advanced, continue speak relevant decision makers, market participants, technical expert time. any deployment unconventional monetary policy tool depend prevail economic conditions, function financial system, efficiency various monetary policy channels. this lead u currently favour baseline decision set purpose cyclical demand management, assume need superior alternative policy responses, of: 17 • low ocr; • use forward guidance; • use mildly negative interest rate stimulus needed; • consider use interest rate swap reduce interest rate new zealanders, • consider asset purchase (e.g., government bonds) impact; • utilise combination above, needed. we could also introduce term lend activity combine action prove insufficient retail bank pass low rate customers. foreign asset purchase could also useful specific economic shock offshore result overvalue nz dollar. the underlie principle would choose appropriate tool combination tools, policy coordination, situation hand. for example, economic disturbance result significant disruption function financial system, would naturally alter stylise order outline above. over reliance one tool “give man hammer everything become nail”. just building, economic policy need right tool job one tool everything. all conventional unconventional monetary policy intervention discuss effective coordinate support whole-of-government intervention activities. change government consumption investment, use automatic stabilisers, welfare transfers, vary tax rate cyclical well structural/permanent impact economic activity modern economy. this simple observation appear one ignore factor globally recent economic history. a government’s fiscal policy deliver similar outcome short-term inflation employment monetary policy. however, fiscal retrenchment occur simultaneously monetary expansion akin one foot brake, accelerator. at time make economic sense, time. if government’s fiscal credibility low, investor may comfortable government focus purely debt reduction fiscal restraint. however, government’s debt low, significant long-term benefit spend and/or investing, expansionary fiscal stance make sense. here new zealand, example, government recently opt increase bring forward infrastructure investment.16 this action support monetary policy meet mandate, increase activity employment. the nature economic shock authority may look mitigate inform choice tools. a specific supply shock (where good service cannot produce 16 budget policy statement 2020, budget.govt.nz/budget/2020/bps/delivering-for-nz-infrastructure.htm 18 reason) may good manage fiscal support (both automatic stabiliser and/or target intervention), monetary policy assist rather leading. new zealand’s current drought condition region north island provide example supply shock. if drought remain relatively region-specific, and/or short-lived, monetary policy would limit stabilisation role. any result loss production may short-term, automatic fiscal stabiliser and/or target government transfer spend would effective mitigate broad economic disruption. meanwhile, monetary policy would remain focus longer-term impact income wealth, hence inflation employment pressures. a similar set consideration confront policymakers globally present spread covid-19 virus. the eventual economic impact global supply demand depend location, severity, duration virus. the optimal mix policy response drive factors. the severity term disruption economic activity depend virus contain controlled, long persist, collective response governments, officials, consumers, investor events. the reserve bank’s monetary policy committee pick supply demand issues. we need account international monetary fiscal responses, financial market price change (e.g., exchange rate yield curve), domestic fiscal response intentions, inform response. we also remain regular dialogue treasury ass monetary fiscal policy best coordinated. we need consider realistic effective potential change level ocr buff new zealand economy shock lack rainfall onset virus. the reserve bank also well practice business continuity role team role economy. for example, ongoing business consumer access credit liquidity bank system, ongoing orderly access new zealand institution global financial markets, key focus mandate. we ensure stable payment settlement system, money cash flow usual circumstances. for us, monetary policy financial stability decision repeat process duration severity event play out. we sound start position inflation near target mid-point, employment maximum sustainable level, already stimulatory monetary conditions, sound financial system. conclusion monetary policy mandate maintain stability general level price contribute achieve maximum sustainable employment prove success globally recent decades. an outcome low inflation rate structural factor unprecedented low nominal interest rates. these circumstance lead 19 increase use alternative monetary policy lever rather central banks’ official interest rates. the use alternative – unconventional - monetary policy tool prove successful general support positive inflation employment post-gfc period across wide range economies. these tool have, however, necessitate new mode operation communication. they also work different transmission mechanisms, thus provide vary degree effectiveness unanticipated outcomes. the unanticipated outcome – market function differently, asset price impacted, government balance sheet inflate expose risk – understood. but, outcome become significant long interest rate remain unprecedentedly low. the reserve bank new zealand not, still not, need use alternative monetary policy instrument ocr. but best prepared. this speech outline key principle would use ass alternative tool available bank, operational preparation would need. we confident success assessment implementation, also aware tool work best support wide stabilisation policy additional macroprudential considerations. in event ever use unconventional tools, goal would ensure strong sustain increase economic activity, inflation expectation remain well-anchored target mid-point. stephen s poloz: economic progress report - work

indigenous student student withdisabilities. congratulation everybody.i explain decision yesterday cut interest rate half percentage point. notsurprisingly, threat global economy covid-19—the coronavirus—played centralrole deliberations, coordinate actively g7 central bank fiscalauthorities. people rightfully concern situation, give human toll virus istaking tragic consequence affected. at stage, disease partlyunderstood. we count public health authority give u good advice contain thesituation due course.the bank’s job think covid-19 may affect economy. it already disruptedthe chinese economy significantly. this ripple effect everywhere chineseproducers highly integrate rest world supply chains. a virusspreads, disruption may repeat many countries. of course, travel plan arebeing cancelled, obvious implication consumer spend travel-related business.but may persistent economic effect erode consumer businessconfidence. indeed, canadian companies, many already force thesidelines uncertainty future nafta us-china trade war, could retrenchfurther.the canadian economy demonstrate good resilience past couple years. thatresilience could seriously test covid-19, however, depend severity andduration effects. so, i discus yesterday’s interest rate decision detail, let mespend minute foundation resilience—canada’s strong labour market.today’s labour marketthe basic story canadian labour market similar number majoreconomies. even though unemployment low, sense unease among many people.some worry displace technology foreign competition, others findingstable work gig economy.still, number clearly show canadian labour market good health overall. last 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech year, nearly 300,000 job create canada. the unemployment rate 6 percentthroughout 2019, near low 40 years. meanwhile, wage growth increasedfrom around 2 percent near 3 percent.importantly, quality job also improving. there way look job quality. first,job gain concentrate full-time work. second, share people work part-time involuntarily shrink near low decade. the bank publish acomprehensive staff analytical note come week look wide range indicatorsof earnings, job security work-life balance. it show job quality clearly improve incanada past five years.another sign labour market health many people change job get good matchwith skill experience—a process economist call churn. nationwide, churn atlevels last see decade ago, global financial crisis. the late availabledata show canadian change job see wage rise 12 14 percent.there little doubt job switch raise productivity economy, latestdata indeed show rise trend productivity.there more. it take le time average unemployed people find jobs. and aremore half million job vacancy economy. this mesh i hear frombusiness leader across country, say big challenge find qualifiedpeople fill exist vacancies.of course, national statistics, mask pretty stark regional variations. weare well aware difficulty face oil-producing regions, example. the 50 percent plungein oil price back late-2014 contribute similar drop investment spending. combinedwith ongoing transportation constraints, boost alberta’s unemployment rate, wasaround 4.5 percent oil price shock, 9 percent late 2016, young menfacing high unemployment. the late jobless rate alberta 7.3 percent. this tell youthat, economy adjusting, remain long difficult process. on side ofthe coin, labour market quite tight outside prairies, accord businessoutlook survey. and two province strong economies, british columbia andquebec, also feature high job vacancy rates.another key measure labour market health participation rate. this percentage ofworking-age people either employ actively look work. a rise participationrate signal people drop labour force early returning. this goodfor prospect country’s economic potential.participation rate fell sharply wake global financial crisis slow recovery thatfollowed. at time, major preoccupation bank possibility people would beunemployed long skill would become le valuable—a process economist calllabour market scarring. fortunately, labour force participation rate rise age groups. this make record-low unemployment rate see doubly impressive, especially give setback wehave along way, drop oil prices. this argue high labourforce participation always good thing. for seniors, example, could mean either theyare happily extend work life need work long notfully prepare retirement. still, look indicators, see labour market been, andcontinues be, source resilience canadian economy. a solid, secure job theprimary basis consumer confidence household spending, primary engine ofgrowth economy. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech that said, also plain see still work do. sectoral weakness prairieprovinces atlantic canada remain concern. on another front, canada’s populationincludes several group chronically underemployed, represent significantuntapped potential. in particular, female participation rate still 8 percentage pointsless male rate. and indigenous participation rate well generalpopulation.helping new immigrant enter workforce another potential growth area. a workforceages, generate barely enough new worker replace retire baby boomers, soimmigration key future economic growth. look underneath trend, unemploymentrates immigrant 5 10 year general population.however, first five years, unemployment rate new immigrant high thanaverage, probably due barrier around education equivalency.improving labour market healthgiven importance labour market health economic resilience, natural askwhether policy available strengthen further. for part, bank canada’s roleis continue monetary policy anchor inflation control. by act way keepinflation target, help stabilize economic growth keep economy near potential.this turn mean economy deliver job income withoutcreating fast inflation.for example, consider experience 2015. we know collapse oil price would leadto large drop income investment entire economy cause inflation headbelow target. a consequence, cut interest rate immediately, without wait theadverse effect appear. low interest rate help bring inflation close target helpedthe economy whole return quickly full capacity full employment. this adjustment process sound simple abstract. but behind economic theory weare talk real people. for directly involved, adjustment difficult andpainful. what more, situation force individual take relate risks.consider someone work energy sector lose job oil price collapsed.even find suitable work another province, may spouse reluctantto leave good job child settle school community. they may needto sell house, could difficult local real estate market slowed. house inthe new location may expensive difficult find. it easy face risk andovercome barriers. that adjustment process take long time.in 2015, adjustment facilitate low interest rate depreciation thecanadian dollar. obviously, target labour market policy lie beyond bank’s purview.still, make sense policymakers address impediment make hard worker tobe match half-million job vacancies. there may new way help peopledeal risk involve relocation, overcome regional barrier job matching. forexample, may area could make easy skilled worker andprofessionals recertify qualify job different province. we may also able learnfrom international experience term improve educational, train retrainingprograms.i mention early that, despite low unemployment, people express sense dissatisfactionand unease future. it possible distribution income contribute this.total labour income share canadian economy begin trend downward nearly 30years ago remain low range past 10–15 years. opportunity forglobalization supply chain steady increase automation technology doubtreduced employee bargain power time, mention decline union membership. 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech bear mind globalization automation also generate economic growth benefitseveryone, clear simple solution this. however, useful metric trackwhen consider alternative policy ideas. yesterday’s decisionall said, canadian labour market certainly important economy’sresilience. it strength help support growth income household consumptionthat seen. however, one factor bank’s govern council look whenwe sit take monetary policy decisions. let turn yesterday’sannouncement.it important put recent development proper context. business investment hasbeen fall short expectation canada past three years. six month ago, wereseeing sign us–china trade war begin affect canadian export andinvestment even further. in october, point canada’s two-track economy, softexports investment offset recover house sector, strong labour marketand solid consumer spending. but concern effect trade war couldeventually tilt balance risk us. with economy operate close itspotential, unemployment rate near historic low inflation target, govern counciljudged risk growth would slow great enough warrant cut interestrates. the main reason low interest rate could reduce downside risk growthbut could time increase financial vulnerabilities. and would make hard toachieve inflation target future.in january, condition change reason behind decision similar.consumer confidence decline late 2019, seem reasonable chance thatthis would prove temporary. furthermore, sign global economy wasbottoming out, grow consensus world economic growth would edgehigher 2020. accordingly, acknowledge downside risk thecanadian economy. but, labour market solid situation, felt downsiderisk sufficient warrant low interest rates.a lot happen past six weeks. in particular, global economy will, least,be significantly disrupt covid-19 first half year. it possible globaleconomy snap back quickly health professional manage situation andconditions return normal. however, outbreak effect could morepersistent. consumer business confidence could set back long period time,causing economic growth slow persistently. this could include longer-term layoffs, forexample. at point, simply know.of course, coronavirus issue table. just last week, receive thedetailed economic report fourth quarter 2019 statistic canada. a expected, thisreport show economy slow significantly late 2019. some due specialfactors, early winter leave crop rot fields, canadian nationalrailway strike, shutdown general motor plant oshawa on. still, economicgrowth fourth quarter low 1 percent take effect specialfactors. this slowdown structural—exports remain weak,business investment decline recovery house moderated.the one positive consumer spending, remain solid even save ratewent further. consumer confidence rebound january, hoped. in short, thesolid labour market discuss early give economy measure resilience.what start 2020? in addition impact covid-19, factors: thestrike ontario teachers, unusual weather rail blockades. we hope 4 / 5bis central bankers' speech factor prove temporary, seem head least another quarter ofvery slow economic growth. since already march, factor could easily affect thesecond quarter. there real risk business consumer confidence erode further,creating persistent slowdown, especially give recent decline stock markets.furthermore, world price commodity drop 10 percent oil pricesby close 20 percent since start year. commodity price important channelfor transmit international shock canadian economy. with oil-producing region ofour economy already stressed, shock deepen prolong adjustment processdiscussed earlier. and effect go beyond oil. these stress inevitably find way fromcommodity-producing region part country affect directlyspend le money everything.in light developments,

highlight influence esteem colleague marvin goodfriend, anoutstanding original researcher, policy advisor, friend.marvin epitomize role policy advisor. his research dig deep issues, introducednew idea

contribution monetary policy, i give standard feddisclaimer view i express today mine alone necessarily reflect ofthe federal open market committee others federal reserve system.in preparation i know stimulate discussion, i’d like highlight theways marvin change conversation u.s. commonly referredto zero low bind interest rates, zlb short. these show marvin’s insightsshaped prominent discussion monetary policy.before i so, it’s helpful look back 20 years. a clock tick 20thcentury, many people’s attention zlb. most concern themillennium bug world high alert.truth told, zlb wasn’t perceive loom problem unite state back in1999. the economy well target federal fund rate 5-1/2 percent atthe end year. up then, historical reference point zlb thegreat depression 1930s and, recently, japan 1990s. it simply part ofthe experience postwar europe americas.however, small group economists, marvin forefront, ask whether zlbcould pose challenge u.s. and, so, would consequence andpotential remedies. researcher policymakers begin turn dial discussionaround zlb.the feed hold conference woodstock, vermont october 1999 zlb. at thatconference, marvin present paper “overcoming zero bind interest rate policy,”which subsequently publish journal money, credit bank (jmcb). injanuary 2002, marvin brief fomc aspect research present thewoodstock conference, part session zlb david reifschneider ipresented research well. by point, federal fund rate fall 1.75 percent,so zlb start get policymakers’ radar screens.on occasions, marvin emphasize importance zlb constraint policy andurged u think differently central bank could still carry missions, evenunder constraint. he develop analyze consider “outside box”options overcome zlb. these help lay groundwork economist and123 1 / 2bis central bankers' speech policymakers think issue conceptual practical terms.for example, marvin one first people think seriously constraintcaused zlb could relax implement negative interest rates. now, i know thetopic negative interest rate controversial. but, whatever conclusion may draw aboutthe relative merit negative rates, marvin’s research early help identify explore abroad dimension issue potential choice policymakers.marvin’s intellectual pursuit aspect zlb logically drive explore possibilityfor currency digital component. although many think central bank digital currenciesas new-fangled idea, marvin think deeply prospect long ago. this hasbecome one hot topic world central bank today.the conversation marvin begin woodstock 1999 become basis discussion thatwere late fomc meet january 2002. at fomc meeting, marvinexpanded upon idea asset purchase policy tool propose paper atthe conference woodstock.he emphasize feed asset purchase affect financial condition thereby theeconomy. he expand conversation away think conventional monetarypolicy unconventional options, like balance sheet. importantly, distinguish betweencentral bank purchase short-term government securities, bank japan atthat time, versus purchase longer-term securities. marvin view purchase short-termsecurities ineffective zlb, saw purchase longer-duration security aspotentially powerful owe “preferred habitat” motive part investors. of course,large-scale asset purchase late become tool critical importance ease financialconditions unite state abroad.although consequence

speech masayoshi amamiya: central bank digital currency futureof payment settlement systemsremarks mr masayoshi amamiya, deputy governor bank japan, future ofpayments forum, tokyo, 27 february 2020.* * *introductioni would like thank attend future payment forum today.recent private sector initiatives, include stablecoins, indicate customers’ need forconvenient, fast efficient payments. to meet need, central bank cooperatewith private sector continue improve payment settlement infrastructure itoffers. in regard, question whether central bank issue digital currency(cbdc) become important issue.when look picture future payment settlement infrastructure injapan, digital society, important consider form central bank shouldprovide central bank money, improve private sector’s payment services. thesetwo issue closely relate examine separately. i sincerely hope wewill fruitful exchange views, many expert today future ofpayments forum.when address issues, important explore it innovation private sectorinitiatives could impact payment settlement system architecture money. toinitiate discussion, i would first like touch upon “what remain unchanged” “what willchange” foreseeable future.what will remain unchangedthere three thing change change regard payment andsettlement systems, money.first, basic architecture money remain unchanged. there two form money:token-based account-based. token-based money form money monetary valueis locally store kind media. cash electronic money issue japanesetransport company examples. there difference type medium monetaryvalue stored, i.e. paper electronic devices, basic architecture remain samewhere payment make transfer monetary value store media. meanwhile,the transfer value account-based money occur issuer debit account ofthe payer credit account payee, upon receive value transfer instruction fromthe payer. a typical example account-based money bank deposits. there number ofways payer send bank transfer instruction bank, via bank tellercounters, internet banking, credit debit cards, basic architecture remain same.nonbank payment service provider (nbpsps), lead today’s expansion thecashless society japan, also issue account-based money. user send value transferinstructions account via smartphones make payments. the future paymentservices likely develop base either two forms: token-based money account-based money.second, two-tiered monetary system remain unchanged. this something shouldnot change maintained. the two-tiered system system centralbank exclusively supply central bank money consist cash central bank deposits, 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech private bank provide deposit credit creation base central bank money. underthe two-tiered system, financial resource efficiently distribute private-led initiatives,and system advantage fully utilize private innovation payment services.indeed, money issue nbpsps, fintech firms, whether token-based account-based, create equivalent conversion cash bank deposits. the existence alarge number private money issuer maintain benefit competition provision ofnew efficient mean payments, general, financial services.third, fundamental role central bank remain unchanged. even use banknote continue decline japanese economy become cashless, centralbank would conduct monetary policy two-tiered monetary system control centralbank current accounts, digital money, act “lender last resort.” the centralbank may face challenges, monetary transmission channel become complexor get grasp money become difficult. however, challenge new tous. the central bank’s responsibility ability maintain monetary financial stability willbasically maintained, regardless kind change take place environmentsurrounding payment service money it innovation advance.what will changeby contrast, payment settlement system evolve along it innovations?now, i would like touch upon three thing change, relevant mylater remarks.first, cashless payment steadily expand retail payments. in fact, outstanding amountof cash circulation increase major advance economies, except specialcases sweden. in japan, people use cashless payment seem increasedsince introduction “point reward project consumer use cashless payment” bythe government october 2019. however, time, outstanding amount cash incirculation also increase two percent annually. the preference cash remainssurprisingly strong. have say that, emergence new service great awarenessof convenience, move toward cashless society hamper long run.second, diversification payment service provider likely continue. a recent developmentof cashless society seem lead nbpsps bigtechs, fintechs, retailer andtransport companies, rather banks. for example, fund transfer service providers, typicallynamed “xyz pay,” prepay payment instrument issuers, retailer transportcompanies, issue digital money differ traditional cash bank deposits, useof digital money seem expanding. diversification payment service provider willlikely various impact financial regulation well operation payment andsettlement system operate manage central bank private sector.third, money data become closely linked. many nbpsps provide convenientcashless payment services. their aim improve convenience customers, butalso seek expand ecosystem via network effect induce customer useother relevant business nbpsps offer. this strategy call “data-network-activity (dna).”in past, make payment purchases, words, use money, mean exchangeof certain amount economic value. nowadays, also mean exchange relevant data onwho purchase what, where. in cases, exchange data could datathat web advertisement viewed, nothing purchased. therefore,when explore future payment settlement systems, become vital todiscuss issue concern protection effective use personal data.cbdc discussion foreign central banksin world environment surround payment settlement system money 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech rapidly changing, role function expect cbdc? foreign centralbanks investigate issuance cbdc could put three groups.the first case sweden. in sweden, decrease outstanding amount cash incirculation, reach le two percent gdp, behind motivation explorethe possibility issuance cbdc. a result significant growth cashless payments,the number retail store accept cash decreased, people sometimes facingdifficulties daily shop cash. under circumstances, central bank isaiming provide people access central bank money.the second case emerge economies, cambodia bahamas. in theseeconomies, infrastructure relate domestic currency payment remainedimmature, smartphones spread everywhere. in environment, rebuild thepayment settlement system scratch viable agenda, easy adopt thelatest technology.the third case china. though detail design yet unknown, accord toinformation officially release now, people’s bank china (pboc) clearly aim atissuing cbdc substitute cash circulation. the pboc focus thereduction cash handle cost also address risk counterfeiting, well aspreventing money launder counter finance terrorism (aml/cft).the situation different major advance economies, include japan. the need cbdc isnot necessarily increasing, observe aforementioned countries. in many advancedeconomies, outstanding amount cash circulation still grow annually. at point,there need implement new step ensure people’s access central bank money.moreover, currency system payment settlement system economiesare operate safely stably. they cannot simply jump new technologies, actually, theyshould not. aml/cft important issue, advance economy consider theyshould first address regulatory supervisory measures.issues regard cbdcwhat, then, role function expect cbdc, discuss inthese cases? to respond question, might beneficial review fundamental rolesof currency. in way, potential benefit cbdc, also various issue thatneed address come light.to support economic activities, essential payment instrument safe, reliable,cheap universal everyone. most would agree central bank play role ofprovider instrument even digital society. cbdc expect play part this. iwould like share one view often express payment service providers.as mention earlier, entry new service provider payment market one thekey change payment system arena. in sense, ensure interoperability betweenprivate digital money challenge. for example, payment platform operate nbpsps, suchas “xyz pay” necessarily share member merchants. in words, often casethat digital money issue nbpsp cannot accept another nbpsp’s membermerchant. similarly, person-to-person (p2p) payment money transfer cannot executedbetween payment platform operate different nbpsps.what role cbdc expect play cases? cbdc help remove barrier p2ppayments significantly improve interoperability different type private digitalmoney. cbdc contribute improve efficiency payment interlink varioustypes private digital money. in fact, seem high expectation cbdc thisrespect. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech however, story easy. there lot issue consider comprehensivelyregarding cbdc, include implication payment settlement system overallfinancial system. a case mention earlier, issuance cbdc couldcontribute interlink various type private digital money, could also present risk ofcrowding exist private services, bank fund transfers. moreover, paymentcost associate cbdc much low private payment services, themerchants would prefer accept payment via cbdc, rather via private digital money.the central bank able offer service cheap offer private entitiesbecause bear certain cost perspective provide public goods, is, coreinfrastructure payment settlement. depend design price coreinfrastructure, central bank could suppress private business discourage innovations.in addition, firm individual prefer hold cbdc bank deposits, would affectbanks’ fund function financial intermediation, include bank lending. thus, couldalter two-tiered monetary system itself.it also note that, mention earlier, digitalization progresses, money datawill become closely linked. if central bank issue cbdc, relevant transactioninformation flow central bank. it implication matter protectingpersonal information, also matter kind system design desirable societyin order effectively utilize commercial information business purposes.the central bank need deepen understand benefit well challengesand risk issue cbdc. moreover, regard challenge risks, central bankneeds solidly consider whether effective measure address challenge andrisks. there wide range issues.when design future payment settlement systems, important examine howthe overall function system could improve consider interaction betweencentral bank money private money. in previous examples, important privatesector improve interoperability payments, improve efficiency exist paymentinfrastructure, eliminate friction exchange digital money. to improve interoperability,for example, interlink different payment platform nbpsps participate banks’payments platform might option.closing remarksthe issue i raise merely example relevant retail payment services.there also various case example challenge concern wholesale cross-borderpayments. in today’s forum, hold session three topics, retail,wholesale, cross-border payments. i hope forum provide opportunity seek outthe view expert explore future payment settlement system together. tothis end, bank japan continue host future payment forum future.moreover, bank japan establish research team cbdc within paymentand settlement system department conduct study various issue throughinformation exchange discussion expert relevant institution japan, andother central banks.thank much kind attention. 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech erhubgender diversity policy making, central bank perspective - deputy governor sharon donnery 05 march 2020 speech keynote speech deliver via video link omfif gender balance index 2020 launchgood evening, firstly let apologise able join even person.1 a i’m sure understand, evolve situation regard covid-19, senior leader central bank ireland i require stay dublin. this first foremost public health issue, central bank adhere public health advice guidance health service executive (hse) national public health emergency team.we closely monitor development relate covid-19 continue ass impact economy financial system, information become available.now, let say pleasure speak gender diversity policy make provide central bank perspective. thank her excellency ambassador colonna host event. it is, course, apt discus important topic embassy country proudly give world idea liberty, equality fraternity. in delacroix’s famous painting, woman, liberty, lead people pursuit ideals.and focus tonight gender diversity, important recall, go beyond gender vital. diversity ratio men woman work place. it’s age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, education, nationality, belief more. a make progress gender diversity, need make sure rise tide lift boats. that progress make gender help promote diversity widely. this evening, i first make case diversity, why. why need diverse businesses, policymakers, boards. then i discus how, increase gender diversity central bank perspective. the why…let start why. for ethical argument sufficient many don’t need remind why. however important continue make case gender diversity.diversity help move u away groupthink, poor risk assessment insufficient challenge. and gender diversity need take account many levels, decision maker firm boards, policymakers, student data collect. come central bank mandate financial stability financial sector supervision, diversity vital. a regulator, actively recognise promote need increase diversity firm regulate.indeed lack diversity senior level associate problem contribute financial crisis. issue groupthink, insufficient challenge, poorly assess risk, problem culture. these compel reason organisation business ensure great gender diversity senior level. evidence show u diversity lead improve outcome term governance, decision-making, productivity. research show female participation bank board positive effect bank performance threshold reached.also diversity board mitigate groupthink, bring mix values, belief attitudes.in term business, evidence gender diversity affect process quality decision making.studies suggest high female presence top management could help develop good type leadership behaviour across organisation – namely people development, set expectation rewards, provide role models, participative decision-making.furthermore, reduce gender difference management staff enhance worker productivity.beyond regulation, central bankers, many decision monetary policy financial stability make people background economics. and know perspective differ gender. a recent imf study show economist view issue fairness labour market desirability government intervention vary systematically gender.different view gender, also evident environmental protection study. overall, female economist likely support increase environmental protection male counterparts.recent research germany show gender policymakers make difference. use public provision childcare example, study show municipality high share female councillor expand public childcare quickly.this difference view important often economist design policy affect households, business life today, crucially, future generations. but look policymakers today, must also conscious policymakers tomorrow. speak last year, president mary daly federal reserve bank san francisco, note gender enter economics u remain roughly 30% past twenty years.in  today, le 30% undergraduate economics student women. furthermore, economics graduate also disproportionately privately educated.this highlight need diverse pool qualify people fill decision policy make roles. but gender balance businesses, policymakers prospective decision maker – also need think data. a economist, central banker, base policy decision evidence, diversity different. one standout book i read last year “invisible women” caroline criado perez. the book highlight importance gender base data good understand world around us, inform area policy product design, health trials. through think provoke time shock examples; illustrate implication design policy product all, base data men. she show example woman britain fifty per cent likely misdiagnosed follow heart attack: heart failure trial mainly use male participants. a key takeaway point me, need fill data gap also reflect data use policy design. that diverse planners, decision maker policymakers lead world good design reflect population. the how… so get place diverse board decision makers, policy design challenge design diverse policymakers, student take economics studies. let start regulators. in 2017, central bank ireland start publish data level gender diversity senior level regulate firm 23456789 101112 commit publish data annual basis.we first regulator publish data fitness probity application diversity lens. we analyse application receive central bank pre-approval senior role across sector regulate, include banking, insurance, asset management, security markets, credit unions, example.building data, carry review approach diversity policy regulate firm introduce requirement regulate firm subject corporate governance code diversity policies. we try nudge behaviour towards new improve norm, clear expect see policies.when start collect data 2012, result poor, one six application female candidates. in late report 2019, publish come day number 26% one four applicants, two percentage point increase since 2018.underneath small increase, substantial difference role holder across sectors. for example, one four senior role holder insurance sector women, one eight asset management. beyond sectoral information, also see gender balance, imbalance type role woman apply for. the data continue show pronounce gender imbalance board level revenue generate role oppose second line defence roles. for example, female applicant head investment role stand 13% whereas female applicant compliance risk role stand 41%.and see progress, still long way go. we place spotlight issue intend keep there. in 2018, part major piece supervisory work mortgage market, central bank also publish report ‘behaviour culture irish retail banks,’ also conduct diversity inclusion assessments.and next month publish find diversity inclusion thematic assessment insurance industry along best practice guidance wide industry.it worth recall we, central bank regulator this. we want ensure board wide diversity views. we also consider lack diversity lead indicator elevate behaviour culture risks.of course diversity go beyond gender, also within gender, diversity experiences, diversity thought, diversity perspectives. we want firm supervise make good decisions, take consider risk succumb groupthink. the firm supervise expect challenge central bank supervisor lack diversity board management levels. beyond role regulator, within central bank strategic focus diversity inclusion reflect vision desire culture.it explicitly call central bank ireland’s strategic plan 2019-2021. think back i join central bank 1996, bank woman senior management team single female head division. today, senior leadership committee make 40% women, 46% head division female overall staff gender balanced.we diverse view around table make policy decisions, reduce groupthink increase challenge debate. there many contribute factor this. 131415161718 in recent years, central bank establish diversity inclusion work group, chair colleague, deputy governor ed sibley. the group publish bi-annual action plan support strategic intent aim accelerate progress help embed diversity inclusion everyday people policy practices.these range home work policy enhance flexibility work life balance, support around maternity leave individual managers, review recruitment process aim attract diverse talent organisation.we aim enable career progression staff. we place huge emphasis development, training, education, supplement support, mentoring, coaching. we publish annual report gender pay gap stand 2.4% favour male employees.we also thrive employee network help promote diversity within bank.our senior management participate networks, encouraging, guide facilitate improvement diversity inclusion. and, i say one issue policymakers future increase diversity student take economics example. a recent initiative unite kingdom #discovereconomics aim change perception economics economist really do, goal increase diversity economics students.in ireland consider approach also, talk university public sector body employ economics graduates, consider promote study economics wide group students, diverse group reflect population.i dream leader day i join central bank. i didn’t see woman leadership roles. a leader male female, need encourage staff colleague make jump, reach promotion, stretch ourselves. this similar point make year’s omfif report colleague, deputy governor delgado banca de espana. she advise young woman seize opportunities.as policymakers need encourage participation, challenge debate. a regulator need challenge firm supervise ensure diversity benefit agenda.as employer need create culture value difference. we need think people start work, go promotion, return maternity leave, change career path future leaders.but course, let’s never forget behind numbers, indexes, data, individual woman girl story. __________________________[1] i would like thank caroline mehigan micheal o’keeffe assistance prepare remarks.

economy slow signiﬁcantly last year.problems raft emerge market economy cause headwinds, conﬂicts surround international trade policy. the trade dispute unite state china ﬂared summer, additional tariff weigh world trade. the tension trade policy space spark uncertainty ﬁnancial markets, likely throttle investment hurt global economic activity.the conclusion phase one deal trade dispute unite state china has, now, ward risk situation come head again. and “hard” brexit averted, too. yet considerable uncertainty persist. for one thing, future economic relation unite kingdom eu still hammer out. and unﬁnished item transatlantic trade agenda still need addressed, rules-based multilateral trade system shaky ground. geopolitical uncertainty remain intense well. it mainly ripple middle

contain it, considerably impair business life china. this likely depress economic output china q1 also noteworthy impact global growth, give china account nearly one-ﬁfth world economy.other country could affect well, because, instance, china's demand good service fall – include chinese tourist – global value chain disrupted. although chinese economy expect quickly return normal epidemic die down, spread new virus country additional danger.in short term, spread coronavirus represent additional risk german economy, too. base current information, i expect risk actually materialise degree.[1] in countries, mount report case contagion, economy already take direct hit place well. these country include, particular, south korea italy.this also likely spill german economy: instance, reduce demand goods, tourist stay home delivery diﬃculties concern key intermediate goods. a thing stand today, almost impossible gauge effect reliably. it may well show signiﬁcant time lag. should epidemic break germany, direct economic impact must expect alongside ripple effects.indeed, accord surveys, economic sentiment germany february largely unaffected impact coronavirus. and, recently, gdp growth appear broadly line projection last december.in ﬁnal quarter 2019, german economy, expected, stay root spot. this downturn export-oriented industry persist private consumption take breather lively show previously. on average 2019, german economy grow roughly half percent. and bundesbank’s december projection predict similarly low (calendar-adjusted) rate 2020 well.this found expectation economic headwind international environment would subside course year german economy would thus emerge lull. assume viral epidemic put additional damp economic activity ﬁrst half 2020, countermovement could take place second half year. on whole, economic growth germany year could turn somewhat low project last december experts. however, statement currently fraught great deal uncertainty.this year, german economy obtain major support still upbeat labour market situation, favourable ﬁnancing condition increase government expenditure. the relaxation ﬁscal stance probably reach magnitude ¾% gdp year, could add ½ percentage point growth.economic activity euro area follow much trajectory germany, quite weak here. euro area gdp increase 1.2% 2019. for year, european commission, example, expect activity grow similarly moderate pace. these forecasts, too, undoubtedly associate heighten uncertainty. a know, ecb staff busy draft new projections. i wish jump gun topic. 3 monetary policywith economy grow moderate pace, inﬂation probably ﬁrm gradually euro area. the ecb govern council respond slight deterioration price outlook summer whole package monetary policy measures. in view, right low deposit facility rate slightly. but know, i criticise scale adopt package measures.there another thing ecb govern council make clear decision adopt september: policy rate lift-off date probably coming. indeed, survey january show market participant expect deposit facility rate lift 2022. the late market indicator suggest uncertainty surround lift-off date intensiﬁed considerably amid possible fallout coronavirus.there dispute fact support form accommodative monetary policy need order inﬂation approach aim. that said, clear current low level policy rate cannot permit persist indeﬁnitely. the ecb govern council must lose sight exit loose monetary policy. this ultra-accommodative money policy also come risk side effects.in regard, one aspect sometimes get short end stick real economy. accord previous studies, misallocation capital southern european country increase since early 2000s. a work paper recently publish dutch colleague show case neighbour, too. they write low-productivity ﬁrms effectively receive subsidy capital, drive produce would optimal. this negative impact aggregate productivity.other work paper explore cheap loan help keep ﬁrms aﬂoat might otherwise exit market. this lead excess capacity put downward pressure prices. a recent study ﬁnds dynamic could well work europe.the low interest rate environment create incentive help sustain unproductive ﬁrms market. however, suﬃcient evidence date causality. with mind, i see risk thus far.[2][3][4][5] turn attention germany, bundesbank study conduct couple year ago conclude importance low-productivity, non-competitive ﬁrms really exit market small increase low interest rate set prevail years. this assessment still valid, accord experts.4 monetary policy strategyseparate issue surround monetary policy stance, ecb govern council another item agenda year: review money policy strategy. this get underway month ago.in past years, bundesbank already intensiﬁed contact public, develop variety formats. a now, public invite comment strategy review monetary policy website.in essence, come one question: best deliver mandate, safeguard stable price people euro area?during strategy review, govern council ecb lose sight big picture. like mosaic, constituent stone need ﬁt together create meaningful whole. a ass ﬁtness purpose, view isolation. i would like proceed discuss individual element strategy detail and, so, highlight interaction well.it start deﬁnition objective. up now, ecb govern council take price stability mean inﬂation rate 0% 2%. base deﬁnition, strive inﬂation rate below, close to, 2% medium term. this clariﬁed ecb govern council follow last strategy review 2003. one key reason provide adequate margin zero inﬂation, thus reduce risk deﬂation.there doubt difference deﬁnition price stability speciﬁc monetary policy aim challenge u communicate. even many expert fully familiar difference. and sometimes also assume eurosystem simply inﬂation target 2%. but not.an increase number people call target inﬂation rate raised. these call base experience recent year show interest rate policy increasingly stretch limits. in many cases, see symptom longer-term, fundamental problem. many study show [6] equilibrium real interest rate drop steeply past decades. a result, interest rate policy’s room manoeuvre may diminish last basis.a credibly high inﬂation target would push inﬂation expectation and, so, raise nominal interest rate level, proponent argue. it might, therefore, seem obvious thing raise target inﬂation rate point decrease real interest rate balance out. and would strong hike. the margin low policy rate bind would great would offer scope interest rate cuts. there are, however, effect bear mind.first, increase monetary policy’s room manoeuvre might large hoped. if ﬁrms adjust price setting, relationship aggregate demand inﬂation could weakened. there would room cut interest rates, impact individual interest rate move inﬂation would diminished. second, danger inﬂation expectation cannot re-anchored. third, high inﬂation generate cost result factor price signal distortions. what’s more, could give rise undesirable distributional effects.this i believe good idea signiﬁcantly raise target inﬂation rate. while increase often moot small, also frequently propose emphasis place symmetry. ultimately, much effect target inﬂation rate.either way, would increase pressure monetary policymakers take action. and would time positive impact monetary policy action real economy potentially dwindle risk side effect rise.take, instance, impact low interest rate banks. bank beneﬁt cut interest rate short term, particularly via valuation effect – say, rise asset prices. but long low interest rate environment persists, diﬃcult become bank conduct conventional lend deposit business. this hamper intermediation capacity – well transmission monetary policy.moreover, likely exist negative interest rate interest rate cut long stimulate bank lending. in view, however, monetary policy euro area yet reach reversal rate. this something christine lagarde also recently stressed.of course, shouldn’t (tonne) tailor strategy consequence face today. after all, need provide u long-term guidance. but turn blind eye consequences. rather, need understand them.[7][8][9][10] all all, i propose formulate aim way understandable, forward-looking realistic.in future, tailor monetary policy communication closely general public. we deﬁne aim people grasp easily make sense it, mean must also reﬂect real-life situations. that’s i mean term “understandable”.another important factor make sure monetary policy safeguard stable price medium term; words, must look towards future, before. one reason monetary policy measure tend take full effect certain amount time. that’s i mean i say “forward-looking”.and ﬁnally, set aim, make clear cannot control inﬂation exact decimal point. that’s i mean “realistic”.i don’t (tonne) think current approach bad job meet three criteria.the advantage deﬁning aim way monetary policy, medium-term orientation, give necessary ﬂexibility. we therefore can, occasion, wait good reason instead rush respond every change data reliable overall picture formed.an aim deﬁned basis principle also go long way towards anchor inﬂation expectations. people anchor expectation target inﬂation rate understand saying, receive guidance future, believe ability achieve aim.ultimately, deﬁning aim way, factor long-term risk price stability. it precisely long period accommodative monetary policy potentially entail risk ﬁnancial stability. and ﬁnancial crisis show u turmoil ﬁnancial market ultimately also knock-on effect economy price stability.but way formulate monetary policy aim area strategy need look into. to ensure price stability, euro area inﬂation rate must also measure correctly.[11] our choose yardstick harmonise index consumer price (hicp). although rent include basket goods, cost live owner-occupied property not. if captured, however, price would gain signiﬁcant weighting. that’s think add owner-occupied house component hicp go forward.and take close look measurement bias still relevant. such bias also one reason behind current level target inﬂation rate. but price statistic move since aim set 2003. in germany, example, federal statistical oﬃce increasingly use hedonic method quality adjustment price statistics, mainly order accurately capture change price short-lived technology products, smartphones printers.to able ensure price stability, monetary policy toolkit contain right instrument – include policy rate already low.as i see it, base choice tool two principles. first, tool must capable inﬂuencing development price level effectively. that’s absolutely essential. and second, undesirable side-effects minimal.that’s stick clear hierarchy deploy instruments. because non-standard measure take past years, particular, probably differ traditional interest rate policy term cost-beneﬁt ratio. i often highlight risk associate large-scale purchase government bonds, especially.but experience new instrument also positive. amongst things, bundesbank study conﬁrms forward guidance successfully steer long-term interest rate ecb govern council’s desire direction last years, thus probably help support euro area economic activity.5 climate change central banksladies gentlemen,as part strategy review, also tackle question role central bank play come climate action. climate change climate action indeed attract grow public attention late.one thing clear: climate action matter elect government parliaments. they right tool disposal, tax  emission emission trading. and necessary democratic legitimacy use them.2[12][13][14][15][16] but it’s equally clear central bank climate change now.climate change climate action economic repercussion relevant maintain price stability. monetary policymakers must factor analyses. central bank often set journey. that’s must ﬁrst gain clear understand far climate change protective measure affect economy ﬁnancial system.both climate change transition le carbon-intensive economy may entail risk enterprise real economy, also ﬁnancial sector. these climate-related ﬁnancial risk need considered:first, credit institution incorporate risk risk management. in turn, central banks, role bank supervisor guardian ﬁnancial stability, must ensure also carry appropriately.but shouldn’t (tonne) point ﬁnger others. in term standard hold credit institution here, we, central banks, practice preach. all since, basically, ﬁnancial asset expose ﬁnancial risk commercial banks.i believe central bank likewise factor climate-related ﬁnancial risk risk management. and also go monetary policy operation security portfolios.on hand, i believe preferential purchase “green” bond along line “green qe” answer. when purchase assets, must stick market economy principles-based approach – emphasis market neutrality.but also mean ensure eurosystem expose default risk limit scale. it therefore eurosystem’s interest ﬁnancial risk stem climate change make transparent possible. and start.it might make sense u purchase accept collateral monetary policy purpose kind security issuer meet certain climate-related report requirements. by take measure, eurosystem would also support exist transparency initiatives.[17] we could also examine whether take climate-related ﬁnancial risk account rat suitable criterion come buy security accept collateral monetary policy reﬁnancing operations. a criterion like would enable u foster comparable standard rat agency banks.both measure – transparency standard issuer requirement rat – wouldn’t (tonne) make easy u central bank take climate-related ﬁnancial risk account. if design properly, could also generate great transparency beyond monetary policy asset purchase programme improve level information climate risk capital market.with measures, central bank could act catalyst “green” ﬁnancial system support climate policy pursue eu member state without thereby risk conﬂict tasks.6 public financesbesides climate action, also face additional major challenge: demographic change. this likely noticeable drag trend growth german economy, make measure strengthen basis growth important.one key pillar must surely public infrastructure, still remain locational advantage germany. that said, also vulnerability ﬁxed. investment transport network one issue. climate policy goal could become increasingly important, too. education daycare place child example area perceive backlog.however, isn’t (tonne) always matter government role investor. in area digitalisation energy supply, government instead create suitable framework private sector investment. additional public investment often moot already. however, would good see weak point remedied quickly. currently, construction capacity constrain effect, compound drawn-out proceed construction even begin.at rate, neither lack ﬁscal leeway debt brake stand way high government investment present. the federal government currently ﬁscal space. it close last year favourably yet high reserves.however, ﬁscal policy stance expansionary. this mean ﬁscal space shrinking. and considerable risk regarding, instance, whether solidarity surcharge continue levied. demographic change impose considerable additional burden increasingly reﬂected middle decade onwards: baby boomer retire year come, fund statutory pension insurance scheme come signiﬁcant pressure, federal government budget, too. central government fund one-quarter statutory pension insurance scheme's receipts. the federal government fund largely gear contribution rate, expect rise sharply 2025.we therefore lose sight goal sound public ﬁnances. give that, i would ﬁnally like turn annual accounts.7 annual accountsthe proﬁt loss account 2019 close net proﬁt €5,825 billion. after dissolution reserve (to tune €26 million), yield €5,851 billion, high distributable proﬁt since 2008.we transfer proﬁt full federal government today. accord 2020 budget plan, €2.5 billion use ﬁnance budget, remainder earmark debt repayment.lower risk provision main reason strong rise proﬁt year we increase risk provision total €4.3 billion €17.9 billion 2016 2018 owe high interest rate risk. this increase risk provision complete end 2018.interest rate risk arise primarily major difference maturity balance sheet. we substantial hold low interest-bearing assets, long residual maturity cases; liabilities, however, mainly form short-term deposits.in 2019, picture change somewhat: overall risk decrease compare previous year. for example, ﬁxed-interest target longer-term reﬁnancing operation (tltro-ii) mature 2020. the subsequent series operation (tltro-iii) variable rate interest, i lobby ecb’s govern council. on balance, open interest rate position dropped, thereby cause interest rate risk decline. however, default risk, especially mature asset purchase security market programme, also declined.in light this, executive board review extent risk provision require 2019. besides bank’s current foreseeable risk situation, also take account available ﬁnancial resources. on balance, conservatively reduce risk provision €1.5 billion €16.4 billion. however, i’d like highlight another particular feature annual accounts, because, ﬁrst time since 2014, total asset fell somewhat last year. on asset side, decline total asset mainly drive return ﬂows liquidity european countries. on liability side, euro balance resident non-resident investor record large decreases. this drive chieﬂy foreign central banks.and i’d like give ﬂoor mr beermann, member executive board responsible annual account explain detail. afterwards, opportunity ask question usual.thank you.footnotes:deutsche bundesbank, the impact trade policy uncertainty, monthly report,

imperative growth good evening, lady gentlemen. thank invite today speak south african economy. i go focus see macroeconomic policy role economic growth problem. there principle economics, know dornbusch’s rule, crisis take long happen expect, occur fast believe. it macroeconomic version old rule go bankrupt: slowly, quickly. the point get lot bad data system breaks. expert warn crisis, while, warn become part background noise. but crisis comes, time still surprise everyone. in south africa, get use talk crisis. every time minister finance present new budget mtbps1 parliament, press call ‘make break’ event, important budget since dawn democracy. i answer question moody’s downgrade years. we even discuss distant possibilities, like imf programme, imminent. actually, debt gdp ratio double 10 years, still region emerge market average, 55%. our debt long maturity profile, mostly denominate rands, minimise risk lose market access force ask imf help. the debt problem are. the problem going. 1 medium term budget policy statement a debt-to-gdp ratio 60% isn’t disaster. but fiscal deficit 6% gdp, national treasury expect deficit nearly 7% gdp 2020/2021.2 at rate borrowing, doesn’t take long get dangerous level debt. some analyst suggest could get 100% debt-to-gdp ratio within years. in scenario, lender might give us. or could see interest bill claim even scarce resources. but haven’t lock path yet. we suffer consequence past mistakes, still time make good decisions. it’s crucial use time wisely. in economic terms, problem addressed. but real danger get narrative wrong, end wrong discussion, don’t solve problems, learn mistake hard way, crisis. this talk contribution prevent that, get narrative right. let’s start macroeconomic stance. i responsibility one part macro mix, monetary policy, constitution enjoin consult regularly minister finance, fiscal monetary policy sync. it’s therefore important understand fiscal policy interact monetary policy. accordingly, sarb invest considerable time effort task. by calculations, fiscal impulse growth around 0.6% last year.3 this estimate exclude bailouts state-owned enterprise well interest payments. a positive fiscal impulse show policy austere. and yet overall growth 0.2%, suggest economy experience contractionary fiscal expansion – despite fiscal impulse, growth rate economy slowed. this combination loose fiscal policy bad growth point policy side-effects cancel fiscal impulse, leave economy poor overall. what indirect effects? one confidence. we see survey household business confidence near long-term low moment. people see tax go up, see debt rising, see spend produce good services. it discourage picture. business still investing, ramp production. household hold major purchases. there also evidence highly skilled people leave country.4 2 the 2020 budget project 6.8% 2020/21. 3 this calculation base methodology develop hutchins center brook institution, describe here: ://.brookings.edu/interactives/hutchins-center-fiscal-impact-measure/ 4 faulkner, d mosadi, t. 11 november 2019. south africa: economic implication high-skill emigration. available

://.dailymaverick..za/article/2019-10-03-packing-for-perth-skills-flight-is-a-reality-and-we-must-plan-for-it/. a second indirect effect long-term interest rates. a know, sarb reduce repo rate lately, cut july 2019 january 2020. we also try steer inflation expectation lower, towards middle target range – see results, measure inflation expectation declining. both change would normally shift long-term interest rate lower. a financial analyst would say, low whole yield curve. unfortunately, yield curve actually steepened: gap short rate long rate wide record.5 this result country risk. it market send message much borrowing. it tight monetary policy. a i explained, low short rate low inflation expectations, main channel monetary policy long-term rates, work reduce rates. indeed, weren’t factors, long-term rate would likely around 100-200 basis point high now, make interest cost even burdensome. a is, interest cost reduce real money available government spend – reduce real value budgets. and cost also double past five years, nearly 5% gdp. furthermore, high risk premium spread rest economy, disincentivising investment raise cost capital. simply put, fiscal situation isn’t problem austerity. it isn’t tight monetary policy. it isn’t growth mysteriously slow down. weak growth endogenous fiscal problems. we cannot keep we’re hope growth recover save us. growth low, large part, unsustainable policies. my friend, finance minister tito mboweni man say thing true even unpopular. his message reduce spending, right put centre macroeconomic debate. we shout resist proposals, end least satisfaction prove right. or follow advice, solve problem, avoid crisis. now let move core responsibility, monetary policy. once again, i’d like start major misunderstanding, one plague u many years. it deep-seated belief trade-off growth inflation. this conviction expose u something economist call ‘stagflation’ – words, economic stagnation – low growth – high inflation happen time. 5 base gap 2021 2048 instruments. the yield curve also unusually steep compare instruments, 2-year 10-year bonds. at sarb, often fight tide opinion says: let’s cut interest rates, need growth, let’s tolerate inflation. the tragedy instinct leave u look wrong direction. in fact, good space, one many country reached, inflation low, interest rate therefore lower, central bank sensitive growth precisely inflation good anchored. in space, don’t need choose growth inflation. you growth without high inflation. over past years, sarb undertake major strategic initiative get close good space. our start point stagflation. in 2016, growth slow 0.4%, also inflation outside target range, 6%, core inflation nearly 6%, trend steadily high precede five year – even economy decelerated. to return inflation target, raise rates, peak 7% 2016. then, inflation begin moderating, patient, communicate would prefer see inflation stabilise around middle target range. inflation since largely cooperated: past three years, average 4.6%. progress somewhat rapid expected, part due low food price exchange rate recovery, help bring underlie inflation. that create extra space low repo rate. with january mpc cut, repo rate 6.25%, low level since 2015. the key point is, place get inflation lower, able cut rate without sacrifice credibility. this monetary policy mean work: cut rate position strength, inflation control, weakness, give trying. that’s good news. the bad news monetary policy alone cannot turn economy around. a yesterday’s gdp figure remind us, supply-side economy deep trouble. we experience technical recession second half year, growth 2019 whole 0.2%, bad rate since global financial crisis. analyst focus electricity shortage important contributor bad outcomes, good reason. unfortunately, kind growth constraint beyond reach monetary policy. the scope monetary policy also limit fact inflation stay relatively high. in south africa, tend think inflation collapse it’s 4.5%, much rest world, consider low inflation. the median emerge market inflation 2.9% last year, compare 4.1%. brazil, country much like south africa, history significantly high inflation, 3.8%. advance economy low still; unite state (us), example, 1.5% 2019.6 if south african inflation moderate further, would space low interest rates. but even extremely low growth, inflation appear slow further, see almost risk inflation miss target below, problem many countries. give inflation appear fall much further, gain space interest rate cut mean would need reduce impact country risk. global rate low, helps. but south africa borrow heavily world. our current account deficit, equal foreign save come south africa, close 4% gdp. almost peer country borrow less. if try cut rate far, despite country risk, investor won’t enough reason south africa. they would good invest le risky places. so need become le risky, enjoy benefit low global rates. key public-sector driver inflation, like public sector wage bill administer prices, could also help ease inflation. this fiscal monetary policy need sync. finally, fundamentally, need appreciate limit monetary toolbox growth. let give example italy. italy part euro zone. euro area inflation low, european central bank make major effort push back again, policy include negative interest rate quantitative easing. but italy large debt burden. it problem political fiscal policy uncertainty. over past five years, italy average growth le 1%. germany, exact monetary policy, average growth close 2%. spain, which, like italy, major victim 2011-2012 euro crisis, average nearly 3%.7 clearly, tailwind easy monetary policy enough overcome headwind italy’s challenges. of course, south africa different country. but take away much growth monetary policy, still possible stagnate loose monetary policy imaginable. the fact matter is, south africa make high-growth country. we save enough fund adequate level investment. we invest le 20% gdp; sustain strong growth, investment least 25% gdp. we focus domestic 6 this number refer change private consumption expenditure deflator, federal reserve’s target measure inflation. 7 the exact average 1.7% germany, 0.9% italy, 2.9% spain, period 2015-2019. the data draw imf world economic outlook database. consumption growth driver, grind large part economy. this effort raise household consumption high ever share gdp.8 but grow slowly ever. we accumulate debt fast almost peer countries, grind fiscal policy supportive growth. but growth stimulus work smooth business cycles; it’s long-run growth strategy. long-run growth savings, investment exports. it raise productivity. we south africa deliberately run savings, focus consumption, pull imports. our productivity growth exceptionally low, perhaps negative. we therefore surprise growth stagnated. lady gentlemen, conclude: south africa get reform. it involve pain, long delay, painful be. we tell comfort story pain-free alternatives, narrative misleading. we spend lot time search easy options. these scheme don’t stand scrutiny. here’s really mitigate pain necessary reform. first, take edge interest rate tool. provide low inflation, country risk come down, keep rate low, maybe go lower. second, devise credible plan make thing good again. in macroeconomics, many things, it’s are, much you’re going. the story last year south africa drift crisis. this south african story before. we have, past, able change narrative. south africa many friends, lot money desperate good growth economy invest in. we one win country again. thank you. 8 in third quarter 2019, household consumption reach 62.1% gdp (using real, seasonally adjust annualised data). over past 20 years, average slightly 60% gdp. investment government consumption also long-run averages, net export lower. benjamin e diokno: gear road ahead - foresightand purposespeech mr benjamin e diokno, governor bangko sentral ng pilipinas (bsp, centralbank philippines), 17th professional

speech challenge population age central bank perspective public lecture international center monetary bank study (icmb), geneva pablo hernández de  governor 03.03.2020 1 good afternoon. let start thank professor ugo panizza invitation participate public lecture organise international center monetary bank studies. i cannot think good place share think population age challenge poses, particular central bank standpoint. in talk i first describe process demographic transformation world undergoing. next, i shed light challenge population age pose macroeconomic development policies. finally, i focus implication age society financial system. the demographic transformation in recent decades, country around globe experience population ageing, phenomenon poise transform society economy live. currently, accord unite nation world population prospects, 1 11 people world 65, 1 20 people back 1950. indeed, thirty year hence, projection point percentage people 65 reach 16% population, word 1 6 people. the figure quite telling. actually, world demographic structure long resemble population pyramid. rather, turn slender tower. 2 the scale phenomenon truly unprecedented, yet cause well known. there two main quite clear reason behind demographic transformation. first, fertility rate drop substantially since second half 20th century. specifically, number live birth per woman halved, 5 1950 2.5 2020. and second, life expectancy increase dramatically, parallel extensive improvement health nutrition. while world life expectancy birth stand 47 year 1950, exceed 72 year today. in words, since 1950 life expectancy increase 3.5 year every decade. the fall fertility rise longevity also mean that, come decades, work age population grow significantly slowly total population. not 3 that: worth note geographical area divergence might become dramatic. for instance, unite nation (un) estimate europe number death outnumber birth since mid-1990s. a result, un project workforce europe shrink close 80 million people 2050. this equivalent say europe lose 1.6 10 worker next 30 years. note also projection already incorporate positive net inflow migrant would offset, degree, labour supply shortage. specifically, central scenario un assume that, net terms, around 25 million people come europe 2020-2050 period. therefore, back-of-the-envelope calculation show hold work age population constant would require least three time net migration flow assume baseline scenario. put another way, europe offset project decrease working-age population receive migrants, would need net influx around 2.6 million people year next 3 decades, roughly twice net migration flow europe receive recent past. we cannot overstate challenge magnitude pose economic, social political perspective. 4 it worth stress population age become global phenomenon. a close look cross-country evolution old-age dependency ratio, is, ratio over-65s working-age population, illustrative trend. while 1950 country world feature old-age dependency ratio 20%, nowadays 59 country surpass level, include one european country. in 2050, accord un population projections, group country old-age dependency ratio 20% double 118, comprise nation europe, north america asia. indeed, accord projections, asian european country japan, korea, spain italy, 3 working-age individual every 2 people 65 year 2050, compare average 11 working-age individual every person 65 1950. even african countries, home young population world, see moderate increase dependency ratio year come. i mention early net migration inflow help sustain current workforce level europe. however, obvious fact migrant become part retire population reach retirement age imply benefit term old-age dependency ratio le evident. it effect last extent immigrant flow increase future. hence, may conclude role migration, come address population age measure dependency ratios, probably limited. 5 certainly, must bear mind considerable uncertainty fertility, mortality migration flow evolve come decades. accordingly, point estimate future population level dependency ratio must view caution. in fact, analysis explicitly account uncertainty, result show high degree variation intensity future population ageing. for example, scenario consider un population projections, build upon different assumption fertility, mortality migration, suggest dependency ratio europe could range 43% 52% 2050 35% 61% 2070, versus today’s ratio 29%. in sum, uncertainty demographic projection sizable, distant horizon, great uncertainty is. yet acknowledge limit ability produce precise forecast future lead u trust benign scenario eventually materialising. in fact, realm demographic projection uncertainty travel directions. while scenario point moderate population ageing, instance result high fertility, others suggest dependency ratio could substantially high project baseline. in fact, country spain unite kingdom, uncommon under-predict life expectancy successive projection rounds. against background demographic change, worth examine multiple effect age population may exert macroeconomy, include macroeconomic policy government policy-makers implement result. 6 macroeconomic implication demographic change come wide profound economic consequences. most relevant macroeconomic policy are, least, three consequences. one implication small old working-age population potential growth inflation. secondly, economy undergo deep structural change, economic activity shift across sector occupations, population age might accelerate. finally, balance save investment call low equilibrium interest rates, strong consequence conduct monetary fiscal policies. i refer implication turn. first, far potential growth concerned, several reason demography key. obviously, low growth rate working-age population imply low potential output growth, direct effect labour supply. additionally, without significant increase retirement age, employment rate likely low since follow life cycle pattern, low age close retirement. more interest controversial implication population age productivity growth. there empirical reason worry negative consequence old labour force productivity growth. some study document low innovative activity firm old workers. there also presumption country old populations, le entrepreneurship. this old people tend le entrepreneurial, also young people le entrepreneurial country old populations. whatever confidence may place hypotheses, fact matter advance countries, even though resource devote r&d, indicator innovation number patent decline trend. 7 admittedly, new technological development (such digitalisation, robotics artificial intelligence) could source fast productivity growth. and plausibly, population age may actually promote automation. but eventually automation progress insofar new idea (so-called product innovation) emerge. whatever net effect productivity, evidence association demography growth advance economy recent decades, rule possibility population age might significantly decrease potential output growth. give population projections, extrapolate observe association come decade yield decline output growth 1 percentage point (pp) 2030, close 2 pp country demographic transition accelerate year ahead. and recent observation productivity growth encouraging. whatever measurement use (either labour productivity total factor productivity) clear productivity slowdown advance economy last two decades, even though total factor productivity growth recover somewhat last one. there discussion extent global productivity trend due either miss-measurement, delay diffusion new technology potential effects, fundamental reasons, slow innovation rate. nevertheless, cannot take grant productivity growth could compensate negative effect population age potential growth. 8 population age may also affect trend inflation. there several reasons, some, all, composition effect basket consumption good employment may associate old population. first, consumption basket young adult include high proportion expenditure durable good service old age groups, whose consumption basket include high expenditure non-durable good low expenditure services, many service consume non-market services. thus population age might prompt change relative demand good services. if high demand concentrate good service low price growth, population age would put certain degree downward pressure inflation. secondly, population age tend increase inflation aversion, insofar old people accumulate wealth, therefore generally net creditors, averse inflation. thirdly, composition effect consumption could give rise change sectoral occupational composition employment, increase share employment low highly-skilled occupation reduce medium-skilled occupations, skills’ pattern require produce good service grow demand. accordingly, demographic could also accelerate trend towards polarisation employment observe since early 1990s usually attribute technological advance result automation routine tasks. polarisation increase share low-skill occupation service may tend reduce wage pressures. finally, since wage growth generally fast start person work life, quite steady towards end, tend lessen share employ population approach retirement age increases. these deflationary pressure may strong, although, admittedly, empirical evidence effect demographic change inflation rate yet conclusive. 9 a implication demographic change structural change, link also clear. we demand basket good service entire life cycle. moreover, comparative advantage perform across different productive task also change age. thus, surprise see change sectoral occupational distribution economic activity, demand supply channels. the cite example increase demand health non-market services, europe typically provide public sector. but also negative association weight old population share manufacture sector, gdp employment terms. this negative association observe across country also time, disappear factors, stage development female labour force participation, take account. thus, prepare witness significant change sectoral occupational composition economic activity demographic change (and associate technological transformations) accelerate come decades. 10 let turn implication demographic change balance save investment and, thus, so-called natural rate interest, something obvious reason closely follow central banks. save likely increase population ageing, people need devote resource retirement. moreover, demand investment likely low population ages, trend also make acute nature technological change witness seem require intangible few traditional capital goods. no wonder estimate point significant decrease natural rate interest recent decades, one closely associate demographics: among main factor potentially behind course natural rate (which also include technological growth change risk premia), clearly demographic component account low-frequency changes. this decline natural real interest significant implication monetary policy. a low natural real interest rate, together deflationary pressure associate demographic technological factor behind low interest rates, imply high probability nominal policy rate hit effective low bound, alternatively so-called reversal rate (i.e. level rate cut may become contractionary), thus hamper ability conventional monetary policy stabilise economy. the strategy review exercise currently take place major central banks, associate in-depth analysis effectiveness non-conventional measure macroeconomic environment, partly reflect fact optimal policy mix macroeconomic stabilisation might change follow decline equilibrium interest rates. there also good reason presume that, new optimal policy mix, fiscal macroprudential policy ought play big role. with low interest rate give growth rate, fiscal space larger, give primary deficit lead low public debt ratio steady state. there also argument support idea fiscal multiplier might large monetary policy constrain effective low bound. 11 nevertheless, debate, note caution order. one source concern public debt ratio also future expenditure commitment already high. this many public programmes, pension systems, require fund population ages. another concern tax revenue traditional instrument income consumption tax may lower, among reason compositional effect associate low effective tax rate old people. moreover, conventional fiscal stabiliser rely progressive income taxation transfer may become le effective. since good reason rely discretionary fiscal measure stabilisation purposes, might need alternative instrument so-called “semi-automatic stabilisers”. these fiscal instrument involve tax reduction increase transfer automatically come play economy go recession. finally, population age might also erode effectiveness fiscal multiplier since difference marginal propensity consume life cycle make consumption old le responsive fiscal transfers. a macroprudential policies, also use additional macroeconomic stabilisation mechanism. indeed, introduction macroprudential instrument complement stabilise capacity monetary fiscal policy probably one significant advance wake international financial crisis. for country belong monetary union, introduction tool particularly important. this one instrument available domestic level ensure stability domestic financial system. in particular, instruments, countercyclical capital buffer, use build capital buff financial institution good time deploy condition worsen. the use macroeconomic stabilisation mechanisms, ccyb1, particularly significant setting, present one, monetary policy scope limited. a relevant issue regard extent macropudential measure complementary substitutive respect monetary policy instruments. for instance, activation/deactivation countercyclical capital buff may weaken/increase impact expansionary monetary policy measures, may negative/positive impact credit supply. 1 countercyclical capital buff 12 implication financial system let briefly discus potential implication age financial system. demographic change affect demand financial product various dimensions. first, demand credit diminish due reduction number middle-aged individual since, life-cycle, amount debt usually peak around age (in range 25 34 years), fall low level reference person household old 55. 13 additionally, demand long-term financial asset probably increase since work age individual need build save retirement, background public pension income might sufficient smooth consumption transition retirement. the flow fund data actually show since begin 21st century share financial asset relate retirement financial portfolio euro area household increase significantly. in particular, share pension entitlement plus life insurance annuity entitlement rise ten percentage points. currently, portfolio euro area household age retirement tilt towards real estate rather financial assets, especially mediterranean countries. there are, however, various financial product use extract liquidity real estate assets. 14 for example, reverse mortgage loans, guarantee borrower's property, form either lump sum regular income stream accumulate debt reach loan limit, fraction property value. other form reverse mortgage include possibility borrower borrow fund need pre-agreed limit. another option so-called sale leaseback contract. in case ownership dwell pass cash provider turn lease property back seller. some product could combine annuities, insurance product guarantee income stream life. however, era low interest rate income stream per unit asset comparatively low, tend decrease even increase life expectancy. these change demand financial product could implication structure financial system. the traditional role bank intermediation fund short-term deposit loan may diminish. by contrast, role non-banks investment funds, pension fund insurance company may increase since good position offer product high demand. a matter fact, recent year non-banks increase share financial system result different factor due demographic changes. in case, financial sector need adapt changes, offer new product cater need population. it worth mention development take place background low profitability bank sector many jurisdiction include euro area, japan, unite kingdom switzerland. in many cases, roe bank sector well level see crisis also low banks’ cost equity. 15 age also consequence stability financial systems. a permanent low level risk-free interest rate might foster search yield financial intermediaries. on one hand, process would leave financial intermediary final investor expose shocks. on hand, valuation asset might become stretched, increase risk sharp adjustment future. against background ultra-low interest rates, recent year financial intermediaries, investment funds, increase average maturity bond portfolio exposure exchange rate risks. 16 additionally, segment non-bank financial sector exhibit high level vulnerability, similar fact witness crisis. the search yield may also foster increase leverage among relatively risky firms. for example, recent year dramatic increase global level volume lower-rated investment-grade corporate bond issuance leverage loans, many distribute form clos. macroprudential policy well-equipped deal risks. indeed, evidence suggest policy effective curve financial stability risks. however, exist tool area apply banks. in world share non-banks increasing, need develop new macroprudential tool use prevent build-up systemic risk outside perimeter bank sector. conclusion let conclude. we seem new economic context characterise old decline populations, radical technological innovation (but necessarily much high productivity growth), high debt low interest rates. all entail substantial challenge macroeconomic policy financial sector. central bank need redefine strategy also toolbox use constraint interest rate policy become binding. fiscal policy might play big stabilisation role without neglect constraint associate current high debt level implication demographic change public budget. in cases, structural policy expand productivity growth ease difficulty associate fulfilment monetary fiscal authority stabilisation functions. macroprudential policy also use additional macroeconomic stabilisation mechanisms, addition role guarantee financial stability. and achieve keep close eye financial development innovation meet new demands, mainly insurance longevity risk ageing, low-interest-rate world. i would like thank

economic crisis* the economic crisis world economy experience deep many decades. both demand supply decline substantially around world. economic policy face major challenges. sweden, small open

dur-ing spring. these challenge mean disappeared, continue deal them. the first challenge financial market function le smoothly dur-ing severe economic crises. this important base riksbank's monetary policy spring. monetary policy aim attain inflation target. a second challenge present inflation statistic difficult interpret. for instance, price many good service quite simply economic ac-tivity markets. monetary policy must also forward looking. under normal circumstance mean monetary policy formulate accord forecast future eco-nomic developments. the third challenge currently live genu-ine uncertainty. who could imagine autumn 2019 spring 2020 would turn way did? * i would like thank mårten löf, help speech. moreover, i receive valuable com-ments charlotta edler, mattias erlandsson, rebecka hallerby, peter kaplan marianne sterner. 2 [6] monetary policy push market rate during spring, riksbank decide number monetary policy measures. when financial market function normal, credit supply economy threatened. here, i wish highlight four measure riks-bank implemented.1 the first concern buy government bonds, mort-gage bond municipal bonds, well commercial paper total sek 300

amount riksbank. and fourth measure riksbank's decision lend 60 billion u dollar bank need for-eign currency. these measure two effects. they facilitate credit supply riksbank way supply money financial system. when volume money increases, also downward pressure market rates. in words, result secure credit supply expansionary monetary policy. figure 1. yield 5-year bond per cent sources:

different type bond swe-dish market. the economic crisis initially mean bond yield rose. this desirable development. but recently begin fall back. to me, obvious riksbank’s expansionary monetary policy measure push market rates. and necessary, riksbank more. inflation statistic difficult interpret under normal circumstances, monetary policy base analysis long line economic quantities. a monetary policy conduct infla-tion target, statistic inflation outcome become particularly important. during economic crisis obvious problem inflation statistic price good service cannot consume present. this course create problem calculate consumer price in-dex (cpi). statistic sweden (scb) clearly describe methods.2 for product prices, use price development similar product prices. for product “similar” products, various type foreign air travel, annual percentage change total cpi used. replace miss price way usually refer imputation. the total weight cpi product price impute way particularly large; amount 3 per cent total weight cpi, see figure 2. the percentage impute price present much high part eu-rope. figure 2 show aggregate weight product group imputa-tion necessary total euro area large euro-area coun-tries. the statistic refer harmonise index consumer prices, hicp.3 2 see press release material present extraordinary meet consumer price index board 1 april. 3 the hicp develop eurostat, eu’s statistical body. the measure design facilitate international comparison inflation. 4 [6] figure 2. percentage imputation hicp 4 per cent source: eurostat what many imputation abroad entail quality statistics? the conclusion current work report write two world-leading researcher field principle recommend international organisation lead underestimation rate inflation overestimation real increase consumption.5 however, probably major problem sweden, percentage price impute relatively low. the problem could much great countries, therefore international comparisons. another problem inflation statistic present actual con-sumption pattern arise crisis tally weight different good service consumer price index. or, put differently, swede buy toilet paper few trip abroad weight consumer price index imply. at present, know whether change consumption pattern temporary permanent. if temporary, actual consumption pattern gradually move towards consumption pattern represent weight consumer price index. if change consumption pattern permanent, weight consumer price index move towards actual consumption pattern. in sweden, weight revise year basis consumption pat-tern year earlier. 4 for information see ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/methodology. 5 see diewert & fox (2020). 5 [6] but regardless whether change consumption pattern temporary not, actual consumption pattern deviate period time consumption pattern represent weight consumer price index. this mean development consumer price index agree period time actual development cost living. it difficult make prediction what actually know future? what use say something happen? one thing use, look thing before. the empirical national economist’s traditional method gather data, structure data seek correlation different economic variables. data gather history, correlation find historical ones. for me, traditional forecast use history various way tell u something future. but course always case thing be-have way before. sometimes development take new path, path imagined. spring 2020 good example this. when crisis came, history much help us. apart unexpected, crisis unique. the april monetary policy report therefore present forecast. instead, present two scenario show two possible development come period. i consider far could go could use his-tory help us. to me, natural monetary policy recent month much now. the problem arise require immediate measures. the measure take make monetary policy expansionary. and can-not rule possibility setbacks. when interpret infla-tion statistic use history say something future, monetary policy also become forward-looking recent months. 6 [6] reference diewert, w.e fox, k.j.

seem obvious, many country require change regulatory framework. where stablecoins use place money, need offer protection money. problem 2 ensure stability “thing” transfer payment chain. exist systemic payment arrangement transfer money stable reliable – bad time good. this generally take two forms: public central bank money - either reserve hold central bank cash; private commercial bank money – bank deposits. prudential regulation, access central bank liquidity, deposit insurance give holder confidence underpin willingness receive commercial bank money payment. this give payment recipient – shop business - confidence someone tap card phone pay, amount promise arrive account. international standard explicitly call payment system settle central bank money possible that’s possible, settle commercial bank money strictly limit credit liquidity risk instrument transfer settled. however stablecoin arrangement propose transfer new instrument create – settle transaction across books. with right regulation, stablecoins may safe use systemic payment chains. but protection stablecoins would offer currently big question marks. some major stablecoin proposal offer legal claim holders. none. this significantly different currently pay: when parent pay grocery use debit card, shop ultimately receive electronic deposit shop’s bank account - promise shop’s bank redeem amount deposit local currency demand. when – pre-covid – parent pay cash, shop get banknote central bank promise “pay bearer.” be pay future propose stablecoins, shop would get bunch stablecoins. if

international regulators’ coordination necessary work indeed underway. a financial stability board consultation ongoing supervisory recommendation global stablecoins, align bank’s view risk – regulation. be role central bank (public money strike back)? the change pay i describe begin presentation involve switch physical cash electronic payment. it also necessarily involve switch public, central-bank-issued money private money. this central bank money currently available physical banknote reserves, certain regulate financial institution hold account central bank. for public businesses, current option hold money back central bank form physical banknotes. i’ve assume story far cash decline rise online continue march towards dominance private money transactions. but right? an alternative would central bank issue new electronic form central bank money use household business payments, also know central bank digital currency cbdc. cbdc present number potential opportunities. it could help respond change challenge i describe begin presentation – include help meet future payment need digital economy, address consequence decline access cash, provide build block good cross-border payments. it also may safe alternative new propose form private electronic money like stablecoins. but cbdc may also significant implication financial system work – particular household business move deposit balance commercial bank cbdc. this could turn affect implement monetary policy support financial stability. the bank launch dialogue appropriate design cbdc evaluation whether benefit cbdc outweigh risks. our deadline comment tomorrow – would like contribute late. to conclude – change way pay challenge we’ve see past several month pose two important interrelate question central bank regulators. first, ensure legislative supervisory framework place support development safe private sector innovation could respond challenges? here, clear need ensure new way pay new form electronic money offer equivalent protection exist ones. and second, right role central bank provision money use transact? i’m look forward discussion. gabriel makhlouf: the economic

focus challenge manifest different time horizon current crisis. and i conclude reflection relevant monetary policy specifically. first phase: enter frozen-state… for duration acute health crisis, global economy put state cryo- preservation. in layman terms: large part economy frozen. in circumstances, difficult think concept stimulatory economic policies. such policy might even inconsistent lockdown, need slow society relieve pressure overburden medical systems. instead, policymakers engage large-scale preservation policies. to maintain best delicate freeze state economy prevent much possible permanent damage. fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 2 such gradually unfreeze economy health crisis control. for this, first need liquidity: targeted, temporary, yet ample broad possible sense. any bankruptcy solvent, temporarily illiquid firm, bank even government waste, need avoid wherever possible. across world, already make major progress front. central bank step in, provide liquidity financial sector preserve government’s favorable access finance. government help facilitate flow credit firms, measure credit guarantees. beyond liquidity support, multiple country short-time work scheme helpful prevent mass lay-offs. in cases, also direct transfer small firm independent contractor help survive crisis, without commensurate build-up debt levels. second phase: …and exit all u look forward moment lockdown-measures eased. however, underestimate challenge associate exit. it likely gradual, might well two step forward, one step back nature. it effect economy likely heterogeneous, too. some sector relatively well-equipped function freeze economy, trouble resume business. other sector might able (partially) catch-up lose revenue soon lockdown eases. however, numerous sector experience longer-term headwind social distance economy, “1.5 meter economy” call netherlands. as, time, liquidity problem translate solvency problems, share firm may unfortunately survive, spite policy measures. moreover, many sector experience that, consequence crisis, total earn capacity economy shrunk, debt level increased. challenge diverge resilience recovery phase these challenge also translate country level. even restrict member euro area, clear difference start positions, translate diverge level resilience. public debt level vary widely across member states. debt level range close non-existent estonia, 175% gdp greece, though know headline number somewhat inflated. of course, public debt level offer useful indicator fiscal space government available fight crisis, narrow indicator countries’ overall resilience. this also depend factors, growth potential household corporate debt levels. these also differ widely across euro area. look banks, know that, term capital buffers, bank good position 2008. yet, bank sector remain heterogeneous. non-performing loan share total loan outstanding, instance, still vary significantly across countries. this legacy previous crisis, need keep serious eye prevent new problem emerging. the diverge resilience households, firms, bank government imply one- size-fits-all policy advice best

large-scale debt forgiveness. such proposal viable finance governments. a pan-european policy response need help hardest-hit countries. recent policy announcement offer step right direction, crisis clearly one solve overnight. global economic challenge new normal beyond recovery phase, coronavirus might also change behaviour economic agents, affect structure global economy fundamentally. one particularly relevant example concern global supply chains. in today’s world company produce product start finish. instead, production process highly fragment take place world. this design global economy enable company around world specialise create efficiency gains. the coronavirus, however, also show vulnerable global economy become due firms’ reliance highly fragment global supply chains. a shock one country disrupt entire supply chain, especially country nowadays rely just-in-time delivery therefore hold low inventory stocks. hence, virus could give impetus recent trend deglobalisation. although i certainly supportive protectionist driver trend, inconceivable company reconsider dependence one specific supplier country diversify even re-shore production process. notably, trend reshoring already trigger coronavirus due digitalisation, enable company reduce cost produce home. for critical product likely, perhaps even desirable, company keep large stock increase domestic production capacity go forward. in addition, authority may engage policy measure impact global value chains. for example, japanese government already reserve equivalent 2 billion euro encourage company bring back production country reduce reliance supply chains. if sustain measure could long-lasting impact global trade and, hence, global economic activity. reflection monetary policy clearly, phase i outline also come important policy challenge central banks. a discussed, preservation phase, brief monetary policy fairly straightforward. our policy direct maintain favourable finance condition households, firm governments, mitigate amplification ‘corona shock’ financial channels. however, challenge stop there. monetary policy likely need continue play important role recovery

whether demand supply effect corona-outbreak dominate. the effect virus outbreak medium-term inflation therefore also remain unclear. finally, corona crisis affect longer-run underlie trend global economy even uncertain challenge preservation recovery phase. yet, experience recent decade teach u secular trend - globalisation - substantial impact inflation wide economy. this something central bank need adapt pursuit mandates. it also something ecb might take board – postpone – strategy review. let summarise. we confront unprecedented degree uncertainty respect economic impact coronavirus

initial storm? how reform make great cost effort since global financial crisis perform stress? and, basis see far, which, any, issue likely need attention regulatory supervisory community? we need, course, bear mind throughout scale current shock. we go back 300 year find similar sudden decline economic activity. there precedent modern economic history economic impact ‘lockdown’ ‘social

normal run event prevent financial system generate another crisis. give learned, 10 year ago, cost breakdown financial system, objective reform precisely make financial system resilient ‘tail event’ regardless event originates. our aim first ensure whatever shock, amplify make bad weakness financial system second, well range severe adverse event – call ‘tail events’ – financial system able

global financial crisis. their aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio 100%, compare 130% 2007. and pre-positioned asset bank england could draw around £380bn liquidity.4 a simple think experiment perhaps best illustration point. a similar pandemic could well strike year financial crisis. have do so, overall impact fpc stress test would wipe nearly aggregate capital system take bank minimum regulatory

one particular area attention usability capital liquidity buff intend absorb tail event shock. the result fpc’s desktop stress test reinforce message clue, say, name: buff exist precisely buff shock

distributable amount threshold restriction at1 coupons, key area regulator watch come months. my initial assessment, however, see  bank system demonstrate far likely resilient pretty long way tail adverse shocks. the little think experiment illustrate build resilience financial system good time might seem expensive, good economic bet long run. the major post crisis reform see operate severe stress condition recent month change make derivative market particularly requirement derivative trade prudently ‘margined’ collateralised counterparty failure – sufficiently standardise – centrally cleared.7 10 year ago, financial asset price fell, complex under-collateralised web ‘over counter’ (otc) derivative trade financial market participant revealed. the result exposure demand collateral

reform ensure derivative trade prudently, transparently efficiently collateralised.8 the reform also aim ensure collateral could adjust smoothly predictably possible asset price change sharply time

counterparty credit risk. i return later. overall, initial conclusion derivative reform pretty much job intend do. again, simple think experiment illustrative: counterparty credit risk, unanticipated margin call scale margin relate liquidity flow around system would great destabilise pandemic strike ten year ago. so bank derivative market reform operate broadly intend conclude financial system whole – far – function well prove resilient current crisis? here judgement difficult. we see systemic bank failures, credit crunch balloon counterparty credit risks. but see massive liquidity shock incipient dysfunction core financial market require central bank intervention unprecedented scale. 11 ben bernanke point panic major cause credit crunches. reform avoid panic reduce likelihood

impact covid crisis, central bank response necessary unavoidable consequence tail event. support central bank intervention, market certainly stabilised.12 indeed, seem fully recover pre-crisis levels. i would reiterate, however, crisis far negative covid19 development could cause financial instability return. and although may seem ‘back normal’ move on, i think march episode raise two important perhaps uncomfortable broad question – question need return. first, need resilience, particularly liquidity resilience, non-bank part financial system? we have, i set out, make bank system much resilient severe, unanticipated shocks. the bank system, admittedly, play core role economies. what would cost benefit great resilience market base finance – account around half global financial system? and second, central bank backstop liquidity financial market – solvent bank – organise consequence private sector? these question i believe central bank regulatory community need address. it early answer questions. and i expect new issue arise progress crisis. but lose insight last month give u already system function stress. 12 some u equity market recently reach record highs, ftse 250

thank organiser – mcguinness institute, simpson grierson, climate disclosure standard board – gather u important discussion. thank also mr mark carney. i want acknowledge role shift global financial system sustainable perspective. you shake u awake ‘breaking tragedy horizons’1 speech 2015. now, five year speech, common topic across central bank financial regulator broadly best ass address climate risks. i also acknowledge climate change minister, jam shaw, personal commitment, financial expertise leadership important issue. today i speak briefly three points:  why climate matter new zealand’s financial stability;  the reserve bank’s climate strategy;  the impact covid-19 term risk current opportunities. why climate matter - new zealand’s financial stability we use māori legend tāne māhuta tell story reserve bank (te pūtea matua). tāne māhuta – god forest bird – separate earth mother (papatūānuku) sky father (ranginui) sun could shine life could flourish. thereafter, tāne māhuta

‘market failure’ rife. we simply know true scope scale environmental risk take daily economic activities. likewise, many material cost economic decision ‘externalised’, is, bear others include future generations. there obvious market price sell climate risk, hence personal reward manage it. and market participant often take short-term, myopic, view decision making, push long term problem never-never. what mean never perfect information risk climate change. however, firms’ disclosure identify manage climate change risk greatly assist sharpen focus. after all, get measure generally get managed. and far often good imperfectly measure something ignore completely. what already know climate change hold far-reaching implication new zealand’s financial system. these implication include physical impact sea level rise drought. for example, national institute water atmospheric research (niwa) estimate $12.5 billion property already expose extreme coastal flood new zealand, 10cm sea level rise put another $2.4 billion asset risk.3 climate change also imply transition impact - ‘flight shame’ shift plant-based protein pose unique challenge highly concentrate export economy. agriculture already star challenge triple whammy: emission pricing, change consumer demand, extreme weather. the reserve bank’s climate strategy our climate strategy reserve bank three avenues: incorporate impact climate change core functions; manage direct impact climate; lead experience collaboration. firm disclosure climate risk assist three avenues. disclosure enable risk assessment mitigation, incentivise investment emission reduction adaptation. disclosure subtly change rule game—without change game. firms’ behaviour change direct attention climate-related risk – ‘you manage 3

decisions. the lack action may relate partial awareness. only 60 percent survey bank one third insurer disclose climate-related information.4 this create inconsistent information comparability, lead uninformed decisions. hence, support mandatory disclosure climate risk, especially one collaborative approach industry. there important challenge make disclosure effective meet new zealand’s carbon reduction objective - include standardise measure climate scenarios, sound data management interpretation. we need get right. recently step supervisory engagement identification management climate risk amongst new zealand financial institutions. we also lead council financial regulators’ work climate challenge, include help develop share programme train regulator climate risk disclosure. we haste delay disclose climate risk increase likelihood disruptive step change economic prosperity social cohesion. disclosure play key role ensure smooth transition low carbon emission future. we

implementation period. and secondly beyond solvency ii regulatory regime, key supervisory priority are. a result challenge present covid-19, – like – shift resource long term business priority – include supervision policy reform – short-term crisis management. it’s therefore worth take time think prudential regulator insurance industry already learn current crisis –including solvency ii

businesses, consumer financial sector side. insurer need front foot identify potential impact longer-term business model order meet change customer expectations. covid-19: role solvency ii play industry’s response? i talk previously principle solvency ii pra support - whole balance sheet, market consistent approach regulatory solvency, focus good governance risk management1. the adequacy firms’ capital risk management global, systemic event certainly tested. the information large  insurer show industry well-capitalised go crisis far remain so, aggregate solvency ratio around 150%2. but give exceptional uncertainty generate current crisis, expect insurer increase monitor additional risk present covid‐19, necessary update risk capital assessment accordingly. a key challenge

these lesson helpful come think future  regulatory landscape. for example, early observations. solvency ii write facilitate insurance business eliminate significant difference member states’ regime

framework, limit procyclical effect current crisis onthe level capital requirements. the propose measure step right direction,although would like, line recent u decisions, exclude state-guaranteed loansfrom leverage ratio. together, enable bank continue play full role infinancing economy, prerequisite rapid economic recovery.the preliminary assessment publish eba week needs, course, interpretedwith caution. but expect majority european bank sufficient capital buff toabsorb severe shock covid-19 crisis. the eba estimate impact 230and 380 basis point cet1 capital. and aforementioned prudential ease measures,the bank additional leeway.however, earn figure first quarter 2020 already bear scar economicdifficulties shock financial markets. the earn report four main

inflationary. during crisis, sarb already expand supply central bank money, although see deviation short-term rate repo target, large persistent. in practice, deposit rate set 200 basis point repo, function floor system – essentially sterilisation instrument.15 a predict theory, therefore see actual short-term rate fluctuate repo rate deposit rate, although mostly stay close repo rate. of course, intervention go long, period severe stress financial markets. be implement large, long-term increase bank reserves, would require big qe programme, would need sterilise aggressively keep actual overnight rate close repo target. to this, could use various techniques. for instance, could issue sarb debenture soak rands, could pay bank deposit reserve back us. most policy would end look functionally equivalent national treasury fund short end curve,16 benefit low rate set monetary policy, already happening. importantly, none scenario would free lunch: instead treasury pay interest, cost would show sarb, price sterilisation operations. 14 claudio borio piti disyatat, november 2009, ‘unconventional monetary policies: appraisal’, available ://.bis.org/publ/work292.. these author also discuss, alternative inflation driver, possibility public narrative central bank action also economic effects. 15 this point equivalent one make india former governor reserve bank india, raghuram rajan, widely circulate linkedin post title ‘monetization: neither game-changer catastrophe abnormal times’, specifically point 5. 16 claudio borio, 8 november 2019, ‘wise fiscal policy helicopter

billion government bonds, par, sterilise repo rate, would insolvent year.17 for reason, take perspective broad public sector balance sheet, operation would add national treasury’s already large need borrow. a such, big qe operation wouldn’t lift budget constraint. instead, would end saddle treasury yet another bankrupt government enterprise ask bailout. the exception rule asset purchase entail sterilisation cost interest rate reach zero lower-bound. this happen even zero interest rate enough achieve central bank’s objectives, like hit inflation target. in case, central bank create enormous quantity bank reserves, pile balance sheet without create downward pressure overnight rates. the reason bank excess reserve incentive lend le 0% interest. this exact situation major advance economy much past decade, give central bank almost unlimited scope buy assets. give extraordinary situation, one economist describe ‘the age magic money’.18 this not, however, situation emerge markets. for us, persistent unsterilised increase bank reserve would create downward pressure interest rates. if pressure release sterilisation, would force overnight rate zero keep there. this likely inflationary, even weak economy. create extra reserve low effective short-term interest rate compare repo rate set mpc, whether demand economy weak not. the trick, therefore, figure appropriate short-term rate south africa is. market expectation remain 3% next years. our projection show much same, enough return inflation 17 the sarb’s capital accumulate reserve r20 billion 2018/19. sterilisation cost r500 billion would around r19 billion year. 18 sebastian mallaby, july/august 2020, ‘the age magic money’, foreign affairs, available

develop world plus risk premium.19 credit save behaviour part story here, also need consider exchange rate effects, addition inflation expectation channel. remember: inflation several percentage point high advance economies, real rate go quite bite low theirs. if really need create extra inflation, set repo rate minus 2% minus 3% inflation-adjusted terms, we’ll get inflation lead exchange rate. inflation target crisis this raise really interest question, however, whether head another great depression, case radical policy might become appropriate. there agree definition depression, outstanding characteristic last great depression large sustain fall output prices. to clear: baseline forecast, outlook accord available quantitative projections. nonetheless, understand live highly uncertain world, condition could deteriorate further. it therefore worth contemplate sarb would react depression scenario. one extraordinary thing great depression understand go wrong, why, evolve dramatically ensue decades. the popular contemporary view, still feature high-school account depression, cause stock market crash. but u stock market crash many times, 1929, much le disastrous results. another popular explanation depression cause collapse demand, ultimately resolve active new deal fiscal policies. but 19 see, instance, christopher malikane, 17 may 2020, ‘why argument quantitative ease hold water’, business day, available ://.businesslive..za/bd/opinion/2020-05-17-why-arguments-against-quantitative-easing-hold-no-water/ page 12 16 explanation also give secondary status modern scholars, emphasise, instead, role central banks.20 a former u federal reserve (fed) chairman ben bernanke said: “regarding great depression … we it. we’re sorry … [w]e won’t again.”21 by account, major mistake threefold. first, central bank permit large-scale bank failures, destroy credit intermediation contract money supply. second, largely response first factor, country fell deflation, push real value debt, bankrupt borrowers. for instance, us, price fell almost 10% year bad year depression. finally, central bank stick fix exchange rate via gold standard, require badly time interest rate increases, fed’s decision raise rate 200 basis point october 1931. imagine raise rate negative inflation real rate already double digits! it precisely sort central bank mistake turn sharp downturn depressions, prolong depressions. when mistake reversed, country recovered.22 this relevant modern central banks, include sarb, policy framework avoid precisely errors. we symmetric price stability mandates, express inflation targets, tell central banker avoid high low inflation. we float exchange rate absorb shock rather magnify them, accumulate credibility slash interest rate despite large exchange rate depreciations. we financial stability 20 these point draw ben s. bernanke, 2 march 2004, ‘remarks governor ben s. bernanke: money, gold, great depression’, available ://.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2004/200403022/default.htm. 21 ben s. bernanke, 8 november 2002, ‘on milton friedman’s ninetieth birthday’, available

function stress, too-big-to-fail institution don’t. in sum, far irrelevant depression scenario, framework incorporate profound lesson great depression. if start go path, framework immediately guide u take remedial action. this fact alone protect u another great depression. conclusion frankly, rather 1929 repeat itself, i worry different scenario. a country, get lot trouble. we struggle learn lesson mistakes, achieve consensus fix them. and run time. we complete bad growth decade record – bad 1980s 1990s. on per caput basis, south african get poor since 2013. in world, slip backwards. in 1960, south african income around 26% us. they 13%. they 128% brazil’s 1960, country often compared; 65%. rather, risk follow argentina’s path, ideological conflict unstable macroeconomic policy produce steady economic decline.23 in much period 1994, south africa surprise everyone cooperate despite differences, deliver robust sustainable macroeconomic policies. but accomplishment faded. instead, find sit high debt pile history, argue print money wave ideological banner other. 23 for quick review experience, see ‘the tragedy argentina: century decline’, 17 february 2014, the economist, available ://.economist.com/briefing/2014/02/17/a-century-of-decline. page 14 16 it seem imperative work hard define new approach future. we use legacy low debt levels. fortunately, achieve low inflation. we cannot squander achievement quixotic belief engineer high inflation, somehow growth permanently rise. our experience show belief wrong, set new path low interest rate guard value them. we nearly ingredient need get permanently strong economic growth, create jobs, rid poverty inequality. but need choose, society, things. first, let’s make sustainable choice get u past covid-19

consumers’ propensityto save surge historical levels, far saw lehman crash.some reflect “forced saving” people unable spend willtherefore reverse naturally. but also see significant precautionary saving, asign household prepare uncertain future, uncertainty likewise key factorin weak business investment.there two main source uncertainty today.the first source uncertainty economy recover coronavirus (covid-19), evident eurosystem’s late macroeconomic projections.our baseline projection see gdp fall 8.7% year, surround widerange potential scenarios. in mild scenario, drop gdp would 5.9% year, andin severe scenario would 12.6%. in latter case, output would still well itspre-crisis level end 2022.faced outlook, understandable household anxious futureincomes firm hesitant make

push make supply chain moreresilient, likely lead great focus “proximity”, i.e. on-shoring production andreinforcing strategic value chains.in service sectors, contrast, pandemic likely shift economy towards more“distancing” via digitalisation.we already see transition accelerate retail trade gravitate towards e-commerce,services previously think “non-tradeable” start trade online, moreremote work become possible.as workplace change profoundly, take time new equilibrium economy toappear. some sector grow create job reach increase – think ofcommunication education training, example.but sector could undergo significant change if, say, people long need commuteinto work extent, make many business trip attend many conferenceswhere consume hospitality services.this rebalancing lead high

post-crisis economydealing uncertainty outlook task stabilisation policies, ecbwill continue take necessary step within mandate price stability – euro areacitizens part euro area.already policy dispel tail risk financial market could lead self-reinforcing vicious circles. we orient measure ensure right financialconditions place support recovery crisis.this motivation behind recent decision expand pandemic emergencypurchase programme €1.35 trillion, couple €3 trillion make available tobanks lend real economy.but monetary policy cannot address profound question economy willlook future. historical experience suggest major economic shift like one aregoing today require government action foster change smooth transition thenew normal.in particular, government need foster innovation provide right framework toencourage experimentation risk-taking new grow sectors, support thetransition new job people work “sunset” sectors.in parallel, need ensure condition place direct investment towards thetechnologies sector future.1 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech this require sufficient financing. the european commission estimate investmentneeds deliver digital transformation well green transition least €1.2trillion next two years.but number country – italy among – mobilise investment require abusiness-friendly economic environment, efficient agile public private services,adequate physical digital infrastructures, well-functioning judicial system strongfinancial sector.if action taken, crisis engender period positive transformation. it offer anopportunity policymakers take decisive step forward towards inclusive, green andmore digital growth.a renew focus digital economy, example, help break negative feedback loopwe see europe fragment markets, low economy scale weak investment indigital capacities, time result knowledge economy euro areacontributing half much productivity growth unite states.greater digitalisation would turn help accelerate shift europe towards theeconomist carlota perez term “smart green growth”, renewablesand sustainable goods, also innovation productivity resource shiftfrom tangibles intangibles.europe already host large eco-innovation circular economy industry world euro currency choice global green bond issuance. in twentieth century,europe also forefront creation welfare state. the crisis today offer apossibility consolidate

definitivelycomplete single market. if “de-globalise” also achieve allocative efficiencyand strategic autonomy, choice make full use size diversity ofour continent-wide economy.so potential frame positive european vision should, i hope, compelling. thecommission’s recovery fund proposal clearly key build block deliver goal. butthe european level cannot expect alone.crucially, recovery fund reach full potential firmly root structural reformsconceived implement national level. we get “bigger bang” euro spentif country conduct structural reform need time.as illustration, ecb research show

but uncertainty around forecast exceptionally large: whilemeasuring economic slack already challenge normal times, currently exacerbate bythe highly uncertain effect crisis potential output, short

labour market institutions.such differences, leave unaddressed, risk increase heterogeneity fragmentation, furthercomplicating conduct common monetary policy.third, recent event increase odds large cash-rich firm may absorb liquidity-strapped start-ups, thereby curtail competition, potentially adverse effect productivityand welfare. the pandemic could therefore amplify trend economic concentration wehave already observe prior crisis, particularly unite states.fourth, risk covid-19 lead surge protectionism reverse currentpattern international production. while re-shoring could

by strengtheninginvestment new sustainable technologies, euro area accelerate transitiontowards digitalise low-carbon economy. the covid-19 crisis forcefully demonstratesthat digital transformation

shelter theeconomy deep harm. tail risks, particular, may cause economy reactin non-linear disruptive way.in spite recede stress financial markets, therefore unanimous understandingat june meet ecb’s govern council strong policy support wasneeded prevent medium-term inflation move away inflation aim ofbelow, close to, 2%.two broad decision taken.the first choice appropriate instruments. the second calibration theinstruments, take account potential side effects.these two decision are, course, interrelated. the choice instrument ultimately hinge onthe assessment instrument address risk outlook

itself. upon announcement pepp, response toour action last week, euro area gdp-weighted yield curve shift downwardmeasurably, today far level observe outbreak crisis(see right chart slide 8).in view historically weak inflation outlook already accommodative stance, thequestion arise whether action sufficient proportionate.in answer question, govern council ass whether benefit achieve afaster

economic consequence pandemic threaten serious protracted. most analyst weak forecast economic development come quarters, scenario also long period come. we midst unforeseen economic development need meet various macroeconomic tools, riksbank important role play here, together government, riksdag (swedish parliament) authorities. during initial phase crisis, executive board member already take large number decision support swedish economy, thus contribute meet target economic policy, i comment do detail late on. we note many measure major consequence riksbank's balance sheet – something recur theme today’s speech. today i intend focus primarily “monetary policy toolbox” need look able manage future challenges. i take long perspective discus tool riksbank may need use, especially low interest rate scenario characterise past 10 year become even prolonged. the fact monetary policy measure affect central bank’s balance sheet become increasingly common large part world. this development drive low interest rate need make monetary policy even expansionary. essentially, nothing new – go back time, many example central bank use variation asset portfolio mean conduct monetary policy. the monetary policy toolbox also need take account change financial system; instance, 2 [25] sweden have, recent years, see development towards high share market finance swedish companies. a thing look now, considerable probability global interest rate remain low long period time, monetary policy find way work attain inflation target use to, many measure consequence balance sheet. we need endeavour attain good analysis measure effect balance sheet affect economy become clear systematic talk try regard steer interest rates. i intend begin historical retrospective – focus past 30 year – describe monetary policy develop time. then i move challenge monetary policy face lead use new tools. this take international discussion monetary policy toolbox, and, conclusion, i would like discus opportunity limitation riksbank inquiry’s propose new act entails. the development monetary policy – retrospective ever since central bank modern sense created, objective clear: provide economy

development past 30 year entail major change monetary policy landscape, least sweden. during 1980s, work begin lead country world economy rebuild confidence monetary policy lose 1970s.3 at begin 1990s, sweden experience severe financial crisis follow rapid wind several decade hard regulation financial markets. during crisis, strong pressure devaluate defence fix exchange rate finally become untenable. when riksbank abandon fix exchange rate, monetary policy seek new way promote price stability, sweden join global trend reinforce credibility monetary policy. the answer become independent riksbank explicit inflation target, sweden become one first country world try new path. after year get use new way conduct monetary policy, long period relative calm large part world. many country

reserve monetary policy purpose size balance sheet decline fairly rapidly. between 1994 1998, domestic bond position sell foreign currency loan repaid.4 instead, riksbank conduct monetary policy minimal toolbox new environment. the repo rate, base lend deposit rate riksbank apply regard commercial banks, adjust ensure monetary policy well balanced. weak inflationary pressure low 2 over period 1946-1971, system, practice, reminiscent gold standard, many country fix exchange rate u dollar so-called bretton wood system unite state link dollar gold; see jonung (2000). 3 see, instance, rogoff (1985). 4 it difficult obtain overall picture actual development foreign currency reserves, riksbank use different forward transaction part management position visible balance sheet. 4 [25] resource utilisation lead interest rate cut vice versa. even reserve requirement many central bank around world still use set zero way back 1994, remain unchanged since then. figure 1: asset riksbank’s balance

expectation gradually adapt target 2 per cent wage formation function well employer employee could assume average inflation would close target. 5 [25] steer interest rate work well period, despite riksbank use small toolbox conduct monetary policy. we go mostly talk monetary policy. but fact work base riksbank build credibility market ready use balance sheet market rate deviate desire levels. on wall street expression “don’t fight fed” – mean good idea take position base assumption central bank fail attain interest rate aim for. steer interest rate also base fundamental transmission mechanism function – interest rate economy actually change short money market rate riksbank affect changed. how well function depend different condition financial sector state-dependent. a similar development take place many country period – central bank's job conduct monetary policy relatively simple. but calm surface, two interlink problem bubble – trend fall real interest rate rise debts. i talk problem several occasions.5 fall interest rate over past 30 years, interest rate around world fall heavily. this is, course, partly due central bank conduct monetary policy succeed bring average level inflation high level 1980s, good. but also due global development towards low real interest rate (see figure 3), something say anything monetary policy, instead explain real economic factors.6 holston, laubach williams (2017) carry empirical research ‘equilibrium real interest rate’ develop lead economies, find clear downturn financial crisis 2008-2009. three several attempt explain real interest rate much low particularly worth mentioning. the first explanation base fundamental economic theory, accord real interest rate, least close economy, proportion growth economy, latter slow recent years. the second concern ‘global save glut’, (primarily) major economy asia middle east generate large trade surplus thereby increase demand savings, tend push interest rate supply safe asset limited. the third explanation highlight demographic developments. the idea age population need save pension, lead increase tendency save, turn push real interest rate. with today’s integrate capital markets, global trend low real interest rates. an individual country float exchange rate may deviate trend short term, partly cyclical reason partly 5 ingves (2019), frohm ingves (2020). 6 see lundvall (2020). 6 [25] global investor may demand time-varying risk premium invest there, long run real interest rate small open economy follow global trend downwards. the challenge monetary policy low real interest rate limit monetary policy scope manage severe recession cut repo rate. the nominal interest rate cannot continue cut indefinitely – negative repo rate make increasingly attractive hold cash. even friction bank system make possible weakly negative repo rate, possible practice cut repo rate indefinitely. the average repo rate total average real interest rate inflation target – low real interest rate is, low average repo rate thus le scope interest rate cut recession. figure 3: global real interest rate fall past 25 year note. per cent. source: lundvall (2020). increase indebtedness parallel fall real interest rates, indebtedness increase sweden many country (see figure 4). in countries, citizen become indebted state – national debt 100 per cent gdp begin common. in countries, sweden, national debt low, instead private indebtedness high. a large part development explain low interest rates. households’ interest expenditure share income much high before, despite large rise debts. the debt mainly use finance house purchases, and, supply house relatively sluggish (although construction high recent years), house price rise substantially. but explain part increase low interest rates, mean problem? no, i think so. a high level indebtedness lead large risk – interest rate rise, household much high interest burden. 7 [25] monetary policy conduct attain inflation rate close target stable resource utilisation. the problem monetary policy impact several different channels, include households’ consumption decisions, exchange rate investment. monetary policy well balance basis inflation resource utilisation economy whole problematic group household highly indebted. in situation, important bank finansinspektionen ensure credit grant sustainable. moreover, households’ interest rate may rise without riksbank raise repo rate – problem arise bank sector mean banks’ finance cost rise. if global tendency push real interest rate reversed, would probably push interest rate sweden too. and one remember easy increase debt interest rate low, difficult reduce interest rate high. figure 4: indebtedness percentage gdp note. per cent gdp. source: statistic sweden almost major financial crisis precede large increase credit volumes.7 there consensus case, i believe increase leverage mean increase risks. moreover, short market finance become common credit grow rapidly, risk link banks’ short-term liquidity management increase. the global financial crisis conclude great moderation the dream world fine-tune monetary policy eliminate cyclical fluctuation lead entirely stable economic development definitely 7 see, instance, jorda et al. (2013). 8 [25] burst financial crisis 2008-2009. in unite states, foundation crisis create borrower weak debt-servicing ability give opportunity take large loan home collateral. the loan often sell financial institution package together assets, finally difficult know financial institution expose impair loans. when uncertainty spread, unexpectedly large effect repercussion entire world economy. financial crisis take place several country euro area unite kingdom. the world's central bank react implement powerful measure – lesson learn early crisis reaction central bank decisive sequence events. many say, instance, one reason 1930s crisis unite state become serious federal reserve’s monetary policy tight. although difficult distinguish purpose different measures, say financial crisis roughly entail three different type problem central banks: liquidity problems, problem market function difficulty manage unusually deep recession. in addition, long line solvency problem arose. the fact different central banks, extent, choose different measure phase crisis reflect problem need counteract different point time. central bank offer liquidity crisis the acute liquidity problem arise unease spread various actor begin question counterparts’ creditworthiness. this lead many financial agent problem obtain short-term market financing. many agent business model base lend invest money long term regularly obtain finance different form short-term market funding. when access short-term fund strangled, overhang threat suspension payments. to counteract problem, many central bank establish different type ‘facility, number financial institution could borrow money various form collateral – even could sell reasonable price market. here see central bank important task fulfil crisis: take risk time one else will so. in crisis, risk ‘fire sale’ dynamic arising. institution cannot replace fund force sell assets, lead fall price if central bank, situation, go offer actor loan asset collateral, fully apply prevail market valuation, market stabilise. the purpose measure primarily preserve financial stability ensure liquidity supply functions. but central bank support liquidity supply, threat credit crunch bankruptcies, will, course, turn macroeconomic effect impact monetary policy objectives. it often difficult distinguish monetary policy 9 [25] financial stability policy, purely practical term current situation, theoretical level.8 central bank support market function the next group problem relate market functioning. some market important security become uncertain severe crisis private investor prepare buy assets. or else uncertainty financial market lead severe fluctuation compensation financial agent require invest risky asset (risk premiums). this could turn threaten monetary policy transmission mechanism. this type problem affect important u house bond financial crisis. to avoid substantial credit crunch u households, market need keep functioning. during one period, therefore, federal reserve purchase large share newly issue house bonds, desire effect – market stabilised. sometimes take central bank make clear act problem arise. the actual signal may enough calm market. sometimes facility job. if market worry difficult temporarily convert asset liquidity private market (for instance repos), central bank’s facility may sufficient calm situation. if enough, central bank use direct purchase compensate market’s unwillingness take risk. we note possibility expand central bank's balance sheet, indirectly directly, create capacity calm situation. low bind repo rate motivate monetary policy measure the severe recession arise many country wake financial crisis initially manage large interest rate cuts. but sufficient – resource utilisation assess still weak inflation prospect low. in situation, several central bank decide measure need make monetary policy expansionary. both current interest rate expectation future interest rate play role household company make decision consumption investment. one first measure take many central bank therefore communicate probable development policy rate come years, know ‘forward guidance’. different form discuss test different countries. both unconditional promise (“the policy rate raise good 2 years”) conditional promise (“the policy rate raise inflation reach 2 per cent”) tested. the riksbank's repo rate path regard form forward guidance. many central bank assess policy rate cut communication future action sufficient monetary policy need become even expansionary. they resort type measure, know 8 see billi vredin (2018) discussion. 10 [25] ‘quantitative easing’, mean push long-term market rate various market direct purchase financial assets. a measure introduce bank england ecb ‘funding-for-lending’ programmes. the idea behind bank borrow money low cost explicit purpose increase lend household companies. these measure introduce credit crunch threaten hamper growth. sweden, small open economy, hit hard via trade countries, despite financial problem country much mild many countries, although initial unease swedish banks’ exposure estonia, latvia lithuania. the repo rate cut four percentage point alleviate effect swedish economy. in addition, several measure implement purpose support swedish financial system. the riksbank lend sek 400 billion swedish bank also lend equivalent almost sek 200 billion foreign currency help swedish bank short-term liquidity problems. during 2010, swedish economy grow strongly riksbank many analyst forecast global economic upturn rapid recovery swedish economy. the riksbank therefore begin repo rate increases, force back become clear global economy weak anticipated. moreover, long-term inflation expectation fell. in 2015, interest rate cut –0.5 per cent. the riksbank also buy large amount government bond stimulate economic development. the riksbank also reinforce foreign currency reserve good preparedness give swedish bank access foreign currency crisis situation. both measure lead riksbank's balance sheet become much large (see figure 1). the riksbank's response coronavirus at begin 2020, world suffer global economic crisis, time form repercussion coronavirus outbreak. the measure take reduce spread virus large economic consequence create need support measure various authorities. the riksbank’s role initial stage crisis ensure lack liquidity lend continue conduct expansionary monetary policy support economy. we therefore take large number measure reduce economic consequence coronavirus pandemic. when become clear last crisis likely be, may appropriate adjust expansiveness monetary policy. in recent months, riksbank decide • a lend programme bank sek 500 billion facilitate lend company • purchase cover bond sek 145 billion • purchase municipal bond sek 30 billion 11 [25] • purchase government bonds, addition decide 2019, sek 25 billion • purchase commercial paper sek 32 billion 9 • lend usd 60 billion bank • ease collateral requirement bank borrow riksbank easily • low interest rate lend facility, 0.2 percentage point repo rate (from 0.75 percentage points). • offer bank unlimited loan collateral three-month maturity weekly extraordinary market operation common many measure lead significant change riksbank's balance sheet. it may also necessary adjust repo rate, although much scope interest rate cut present. however, major problem moment interest rate high, risk credit crunch major difficulty face many swedish company households. when bank decide give loans, must course consider whether borrower able repay loan. but important help see whole picture: agent take account short-term interests, risk consequence society whole, thus us, unnecessarily large. to increase incentive give loans, government allocate several million share risk new lend banks. the term condition programme decisive much bank lend riksbank decide on. we offer bank slightly cheap financing, unwillingness lend base assessment risk high, measure needed. it question fiscal policy, monetary policy. the central issue crisis measure impact riksbank’s balance sheet instead interest rate. over past ten years, type measure become increasingly common, sweden abroad. an important question go forward extent type measure use conduct monetary policy normal times. the international discussion toolbox an intensive international discussion already way coronavirus pandemic break concern monetary policy framework toolbox need adapt meet challenge future. part discussion mark desire hope return situation financial crisis. but another part focus insight may 9 the riksbank normally buy type asset, early 1897 sverige riksbank act propose bank power authority buy swedish bond all, addition certain foreign government securities. this power authority since pass 1897 act via 1934 act one 1988 currently applies. along road, power authority undergo change word essence still remains. the riksbank right, monetary policy purposes, buy, sell mediate security (including corporate bonds), foreign currency right obligation link assets. 12 [25] change work long term too. the current situation strengthen already great need. below, follow number proposal raised. some intend institutionalise usage already come across description crisis measures. one key theme discussion need tool able counteract future recession credible manner. it also important systematic describe clearly condition tool may used. with condition met, achieve good automatic stabilisation future economic shocks, participant economy understand monetary policy act go forward able adjust expectation accordingly. if private sector instead perceive scope monetary policy limit policy hard grasp, credibility inflation target may jeopardised, particularly situation limit perceive long-term. proposal tool could use provide good possibility counteract recession include: • raise inflation target • make strategy good automatic stabilisation economy shock • quantitative ease use systematically implementation monetary policy • forward guidance • coordination fiscal policy special circumstance • fiscal policy stimulation measure fund central bank money, so-called helicopter money • acceptance low inflation we shall examine argument behind proposals. raise inflation target firstly, must say proponent idea usually mean raise inflation target current situation. rather, inflation target raised, normal level, inflation close target time monetary policy become somewhat normalised. the argument raise inflation target would increase average scope monetary policy future recessions, average nominal interest rate sum real interest rate inflation. if real interest rate falls, inflation target can, principle, raise much restore scope. doe matter economy inflation target two or, say, four per cent? empirical research certainly identify relationship level average inflation growth, relationship quite weak primarily seem relevant inflation relatively high. high inflation also seem coincide great variation around average level. there thus certain support view inflation target fairly low. however, 13 [25] inflation target’s important function provide economy nominal anchor, example wage formation activity coordinate around. there practical aspect must consider inflation target changed. establish new level may require great deal work, take time participant economy get use new target change may also lead private sector start expect change target late on. there also open economy aspect issue, hardly coincidence almost country apply form inflation target policy choose inflation target almost two per cent. it seem likely movement towards high inflation target result international discussion sweden hardly country go first. make strategy good automatic stabilisation shock another idea discuss change central bank's target certain measure history-dependency build monetary policy strategy. for example, u central bank initiate review monetary policy framework one alternative discuss intensively target average inflation.10 the idea participant economy understand that, shock economy push inflation down, central bank will, future, compensate (make up) allow slightly high inflation late on. if price sluggish, great incentive cut price response shock inflation therefore become higher. such monetary policy strategy could, therefore, theoretically give good automatic stabilisation shock lead le need adjust interest rate, something particularly interest policy rate close low bound. bernanke (2020) alternative proposal base kind target introduce temporarily monetary policy limited. however, important communicate advance – measure maximum effect contribute increase central bank's ability stabilise economy thereby affect participants’ expectations. one counterargument that, expectation instead backward looking, make-up strategy lead unnecessary variation gdp interest rates. our inflation target, focus day's inflation, forgive old miss ‘forgotten’. a difficult make inflation forecasts, outcome inflation often deviate bite inflation target important clear advance, avoid give incorrect impression great precision riksbank’s ability stabilise inflation. quantitative ease permanent part monetary policy toolbox purchase financial asset have, various times, part implementation monetary policy. for example, earlier, federal reserve 10 see nessén vestin (2005) academic discussion monetary policy strategy. see clarida (2019) discussion current u context. 14 [25] use non-remunerated reserves, together direct purchase sale government bonds, regulate amount central bank reserve system thus ensure federal fund rate end close target policy rate. how much central bank reserve private bank depended, among things, much bank deposit books, relate reserve requirement federal reserve applied. the banks’ demand reserve determine much bond feed oblige purchase steer interest rate desire level. this lead feed already substantial portfolio government bond financial crisis. since level interest rate many country end close low bound, central bank around world make significantly great purchase financial asset aim make monetary policy expansionary. long market rate divide sum future expect short-term interest rate plus premium. if market frictionless, size premium may partly depend relative supply certain bond, say outstanding stock hand private sector. if central bank purchase significant proportion stock, price remain bond therefore rise interest rate thereby fall. when riksbank purchase bonds, liquidity inject market – investor swap bond deposit bank amount central bank reserve bank system whole increases. how effective quantitative ease depend investor banker use liquidity. the hope investor search new investment possibility thereby push market rate important company households. when level interest rate go down, bank expand credit grant – increase liquidity central bank contribute form buff possible outflow liquidity could affect bank create new loans. there also potential effect quantitative ease reinforcement credibility forward guidance. in sweden, riksbank’s balance sheet increase heavily riksbank own quite large proportion outstanding government bonds. bernanke (2020) one argue quantitative ease worked, sense contribute towards make monetary policy expansionary. consequently, may also become permanent part monetary policy toolbox go forward – rate level real interest rate continue hold short-term nominal interest rate low bound. quantification make riksbank also indicate purchase government bond significant effect.11 however, limit much long-term interest rate push sweden. partly, swedish national debt office facility create possibility arbitrage long-term interest rate sufficiently far repo rate. and, partly, investor may choose switch cash level interest rate become low. 11 see, example, de rezende ristiniemi (2018). 15 [25] if quantitative ease part permanent monetary policy toolbox, would advantage instrument could use systematically case crisis. much development monetary policy analysis focus importance systematic approach communication – also apply new instruments, influence expectation outside world much possible. in addition, central bank need find clear strategy reduce hold financial asset economic activity improve inflation rises, avoid balance sheet increase recession. forward guidance influence expectation future interest rate ever since 2007, riksbank engage form forward guidance, publishing, monetary policy report, best assessment future development repo rate, inflation real economy. this matter convince market believe economy repo rate heading. even difficult make forecast often believe interest rate would rise fast actually case, communication future still useful, particularly short horizon. we able affect expectation follow year communications. other central bank traditionally engage type communication have, i mention earlier, experiment different form rough ‘triggers’ various kinds. the academic background concept insight expectation future policy rate least important current level come affect investment consumption decisions. in normal cases, central bank assume able influence expectation satisfactorily systematic monetary policy. but policy rate reach low bound, possible communicate intention diverge normal behaviour keep rate low long period thus substitute, certain extent, immediate policy rate cut. there been, however, discussion effective communication actually is, particularly long horizons.12 the riksbank's method provide complete picture see situation development economy. but way communicate future advantages. one variant state-contingent u approach: say policy rate raise outcome inflation reach 2 per cent.13 in situation market share riksbank’s view development inflation, u way communicate provide information inflation interest rate forecasts. the market thereby ass interest rate start rise. the riksbank could certainly achieve equivalent effect clear and, use alternative scenario systematic monetary policy, make 12 see del negro et al. (2015). 13 the feed introduce type state-contingent forward guidance december 2012 communicate interest rate would raise unemployment decline 6.5 per cent (with inflation expectation anchored); see bernanke (2020). 16 [25] market understand react future surprises. however, cannot rule form explicit forward guidance sometimes simple effective way communicating. coordinate fiscal policy low bind in last 30 years, division fiscal policy monetary policy sweden quite clear. an independent central bank inflation target use interest rate push economy, short term, direction necessary reach inflation target: high interest rate upswings low interest rate downturns. the fiscal policy contribution stabilise economy primarily form automatic stabilisers. fiscal policy instead mainly focus distribution policy structural issue create stable condition sustainable growth. the background division slow decision-making process fiscal policy difficulty rapidly adjust change conditions. it also insight exist political temptation use monetary policy short term, risk create unnecessary fluctuation economy. despite division, always certain implicit interaction fiscal monetary policies.14 when policy rate cut, central government interest payment reduced, tend improve fiscal balance. when riksbank purchase government bonds, lead reduce cost new borrow long maturities. and opposite also true: fiscal policy become expansionary, increase activity economy and, ultimately, inflationary pressures, thereby influence monetary policy. however, last two major crises, combine low level interest rates, raise difficult questions. firstly, normal monetary policy enough, conceivable fiscal policy could ‘help out’ explicitly necessary, automatic stabiliser (which significant monetary policy)? in words, discretionary measure require active decision could used. 15 depend circumstances, ‘coordination’ fiscal monetary policy would, course, le complicated. in severe economic downturn weak resource utilisation, natural automatic stabiliser start discretionary part fiscal policy, naturally strive normal resource utilisation, become expansionary. the question, however, whether take place sufficient extent, give fiscal policy framework. an interest – delicate – question whether possible expand coordination monetary fiscal policy deep downturns. under present fiscal policy framework, budget regulation fiscal policy one possible obstacle. the regulation set ensure responsible fiscal policy avoid constantly increase national debt. but perhaps discussion rule apply deep 14 there also academic discussion fundamental interaction fiscal monetary policy, know fiscal theory price level; see leeper (1991) sims (2017). 15 see ubide (2020) discussion interaction fiscal policy monetary policy. 17 [25] downturn consider whether scope discretionary fiscal policy could link limitation monetary policy. a mild form coordination could take place form riksbank publish alternative scenario monetary policy report state monetary policy limit that, fiscal policy become expansionary, would lead high interest rate inflation close target. a strong form could involve riksbank inform ministry finance monetary policy need assistance expansionary fiscal policy inflation target met. such communication would reminiscent reverse situation, central bank concern fiscal dominance – situation unsustainable fiscal policy make impossible central bank restrain inflation – communicate this.16 personally, i think independent monetary policy presume total lack dialogue riksbank political system matters. the second question concern effectiveness various measure risk entail. for example, assume riksbank make monetary policy expansionary purchase certain financial assets. this could increase risk riksbank’s balance sheet considerably lead future loss taxpayers. assume possible achieve equivalent effect mean mild fiscal policy stimulation measures. this would probably possible situation monetary policy low bound. the riksbank would raise interest rate economic activity rise fiscal policy would thereby become effective normal.17 in case, condition hold discussion policy mix would appropriate. in addition, blanchard (2019) make point that, real interest rate low growth rate economy, cost debt-financed public investment low. real interest payment growth, ratio national debt gdp falls, even loan take interest payment debt amortised. helicopter money mean fund fiscal policy stimulation another idea bring central bank fund fiscal policy expansion banknote presses. it difficult find exact definition helicopter money, important question concern part fiscal policy, part monetary policy part coordination. the basic idea play fire little: everybody know fail monetary policy control lose banknote press easily end hyperinflation – history give u several clear example this. but examples, initiative usually come elsewhere: central government put pressure central bank fund expansionary fiscal policy tax revenue insufficient credit arrangement limited. the discussion today instead concern situation inflation low monetary policy need assistance 16 see also posen (2020) discussion interest rate peg introduce bank japan. 17 see coenen et al. (2012), estimate so-called fiscal policy multiplier without low bind policy rate. 18 [25] expansionary fiscal policy. however, question whether possible generate enough inflation stop, whether impossible shut floodgate flow money start reach full force. there also interest technicality differ country country could decisive whether helicopter money could work differently normal loan-financed fiscal policy stimulation measures. doe central bank pay interest central bank reserve cash redeem one-to-one basis? if price increase one-to-one increase banknote volume (electronic paper), proportion increase banknote volume closely resemble debt increase, riksbank pay interest future.18 abolish cash – manner negative interest rate another suggestion literature focus reason low bind policy rate exists, namely existence risk-free asset return 0 – cash. if interest rate become negative enough, household (in case banks’ deposit rates) bank (in case central bank’s deposit rates) instead withdraw cash. consequently, possible cut level interest rate indefinitely. rogoff (2017), well agrawal kimball (2015), point central bank abolish cash entirely, introduce exchange rate cash central bank reserves, allow exchange rate reflect negative interest rates, low bind could eliminate entirely. but easy matter – part riksbank's social contract sweden’s citizen offer mean payment demand many citizen wish continue use cash. accept low inflation one interest question measure inflation small, open economy actually have. the riksbank measure inflation use cpif, basket include quite large element import goods, sweden small, open economy. the question whether sweden inflation target rest world low inflation. or must accept inflation low? be reasonable price domestically produce good service increase 2 per cent compensate import cheap? yes, i consider compensation possible, variable exchange rate, principle, capture difference swedish inflation inflation abroad. the real economic condition determine relative price prevail swedish foreign goods. for example, deterioration relative price swedish good could arise either fall swedish price increase foreign price combination these. select inflation target two per cent implicitly choose one possible combinations. if succeed this, gain great scope manage future economic shocks, compare give allow new level inflation low inflation target 18 an interest academic discussion helicopter money take place; see, example, galí (2020). 19 [25] established. after all, discussion above, note that, anything, international discussion revolve around raise inflation target. a closely relate problem turn difficult understand development inflation recently use standard theory form basis monetary policy analysis. the phillips curve estimate increasingly flat, say relationship real activity inflation seem become weaker.19 many economist surprise inflation fall financial crisis, resource utilisation see weak. we need good understand company actually set price behaviour interact macroeconomy. a great deal research currently focus study different type micro data hopefully knowledge matter period ahead. appropriate monetary policy require freedom action there many interest thing think regard different suggestion circulate discussion. but focus presentation measure entail major consequence riksbank’s balance sheet. it therefore important riksbank sufficient freedom action formulate appropriate monetary policy. in addition, risk riksbank may bear balance sheet mean must financial buff ensure sufficient financial independence, subject i shall soon return. the question i find particularly interest concern possibility coordination fiscal monetary policy policy rate reach low bound. more research need here, together practical dialogue central bank finance ministry form cooperation. this is, course, sensitive matter, ban instruction independence consider. but well-meaning rule cannot allow form obstacle conduct appropriate discussion mix policy appropriate extreme situation must consider. the riksbank inquiry – opportunity limitation over fifteen-year period, three different inquiry proposal refer council legislation consider various change sverige riksbank act. the recent inquiry present november.20 the main origin two first inquiry criticism ecb riksbank’s financial independence. this matter raise general council riksbank decide make two major transfer profit start 2000s, 19 see andersson et al. (2020) discussion. 20 see sou 2007:51. 2013:9 sou 2019:46. 20 [25] clearly demonstrate decision transfer profit take political force rather executive board, contravention eu law.21 the riksbank’s financial independence both two early inquiry make ingrid bonde harry flam, together recent riksbank inquiry, base idea that, normal times, central bank’s balance sheet fairly small. the idea simple: normal times, foreign exchange reserve small monetary policy conduct use variation policy rate. however, riksbank need fund operation without annual allocation central government therefore need earn that, average, least large expenditure. the size equity thus need calibrate return it, together seigniorage banknote coins, least large expenditure. under assumption balance sheet small, little extra equity need cover extra risks. the problem approach assume return normal state affair prevail financial crisis 2008-2009. thing seldom simple. i believe great likelihood low interest rate environment part monetary policy landscape foreseeable future and, give take almost 20 year reach decision new sverige riksbank act, new proposal must robust able cope different conceivable development go forward. one critical issue concern riksbank's earnings. in respect, two worry trends. one demand banknote coin fall low level interest rate contribute fall earn riksbank. if real interest rate around zero even negative (as last ten years), propose fund model work all, base invest equity generate positive real return. consequently, ‘backstop’ need scenario realised. in response inquiry, propose interest-free reserve requirement alternative form fund riksbank.22 my assessment that, future, presumably conduct monetary policy way great consequence balance sheet. the inquiry's proposal certainly allow purchase government bond but, riksbank need large balance sheet monetary policy purposes, also consider consequent loss risk therefore need safety margin equity secure satisfactory financial independence. this discussion equity partly new, central bank previously protect loss large seigniorages. however, along world’s central banks, riksbank face new situation demand cash low seigniorage enough fund run costs. 21 for historical reasons, also apply several country eurosystem. 22 the bank england fund manner. in addition, amount adjust bank england's revenue satisfactory regardless level interest rates, rate long long government bond yield positive. 21 [25] in addition, early period central bank expand balance sheet fairly brief. if instead face future size balance sheet, even normal times, expect large before, framework surround financial independence reflect that. this mean amount equity need proportional risk riksbank may hold balance sheet.23 the basic idea probability riksbank ask riksdag recapitalisation satisfactorily low – case say financially independent. in addition earnings, equity must generate reasonable surplus riksbank profit use build equity event losses. the inquiry’s proposal restrict riksbank's equity sek 60 billion, calculate use inflation. a i said, one interpretation inquiry see return steady state balance sheet small – and, world, small amount equity adequate, assume real interest rate return least 1 per cent adjustment repo rate enough achieve monetary policy objectives. the propose act certainly make possible riksbank ask raise capital ratio, example seigniorage fall real interest rate become lower. the problem that, earn capacity initially set cover expenditure, scope use profit build equity independently. if revenue fall real interest rate low, matter target equity high – riksbank make loss framework trigger recapitalisation. when come allow large balance sheet, problem risk increase quite quickly – then, riksbank could find situation retain profit enough build equity quickly enough. the conclusion must also certain buff ensure, advance, size balance sheet expand new challenge require it. otherwise, monetary policy risk become restrict future. once again: illustrate riksbank need flexibility able use balance sheet necessary conduct well-balanced monetary policy. restriction monetary policy toolbox appropriate the inquiry advocate separation tool monetary policy financial stability. i already mention i believe separation difficult implement many case – measure take reason ultimately matter care macroeconomy monetary policy objectives. 24 the central bank's balance sheet toolbox. divide toolbox different compartment certain tool use certain purpose would conflict economic theory practical policy traditionally regard central bank activity could mean restriction monetary policy. internationally, boundary monetary policy 23 see kjellberg vestin (2019) riksbank’s consultation response, sverige riksbank (2020). 24 see sverige riksbank (2020) vredin (2019) critical discussion demarcation. 22 [25] financial stability increasingly erased, sweden risk get law make difficult riksbank use entire balance sheet conduct monetary policy. i maintain measure take pandemic include element monetary policy financial stability. sweden member eu long time and, like swedish authorities, riksbank must somehow relate happen apply eu. other central bank eu right far-reaching purchase various security monetary policy purposes. it would therefore strange national legislation give riksbank markedly different toolbox could argue standard eu. in addition, inquiry’s proposal mean certain measure may adopt extraordinary circumstances. such proposal sharp contrast flexibility central bank need show last ten–fifteen year manage shock could predicted. one critical issue concern much believe (or fear) balance sheet also use normal circumstance period ahead. a i one belief great probability case, see point give monetary policy narrow interpretation normal historical perspective, i consider reasonable introduce type restriction inquiry advocates. accessible foreign exchange reserve provide security crisis a regard matter appropriate size foreign exchange reserves, i two comments. the first size must determine bank system’s size fund structure. it therefore inappropriate confirm specific figure law, difficult make accurate forecast bank system financial market develop come decades. my second point concern whether foreign exchange hold advance borrow problem arise. one advantage small foreign exchange reserve run cost small. if believe foreign exchange always borrow necessary, good reason small foreign exchange reserves. but i involve manage number bank crisis around world one lesson i learn work rapidly develop crisis worsen foreign exchange reserve easily accessible. neither i believe easy borrow foreign exchange fast enough conceivable scenario therefore consider important possibility hold well-balanced foreign exchange reserve restricted. sufficiently large foreign exchange reserve also send important signal rest world ready manage problem arise. furthermore, always lender set terms, time lend preferably take place need borrow. i thus consider riksbank decide size foreign exchange reserves, well funded. in crisis time unease, riksbank must always consider 23 [25] possibility perform remit. if possibility riksbank secure access foreign exchange issue promissory note foreign currency name, measure must, course, consider and, indeed, implement circumstance demand it. a central bank must able use balance sheet i return central bank’s balance sheet several times, this i consider great probability play important role monetary policy period ahead, earlier, least prepare look back time great moderation. in addition, real interest rate continue remain weak level see last ten years, change term monetary policy facility security purchase become necessary part normal monetary policy. it therefore important new sverige riksbank act restrict possibilities. reference agrawal, r. m. kimball (2015), “breaking through low bound”, imf work

start context retail payment system evolve recent year change see result covid-19 crisis. i go discus number policy issue arise changes.[*] the way pay change …over past couple decades, way australian make payment follow fairly consistent trend. the main feature trend decline ‘paper’ payment instrument rise electronic payment instrument (graph 1). use cheque decline around 50 per caput per year 1990s around 2 per caput 2019, payment bill increasingly move electronic. use cash transaction also declining. the rise cards, first credit card recently debit cards, consistent feature well. card increasingly use place cheque bill payment cash point sale. they also important enabler online commerce, allow payment make remote environment.graph 1in recent years, substantial innovation payment industry further trend also widen payment option (graph 2). the introduction contactless payment make quick easy make lower-value transaction card, eat traditional domain cash transactions. the use mobile device like smartphones payment reinforce trend – even pull card. real-time person-to-person payment available use new payment platform. buy now, pay late payment option widely available online point-of-sale purchases. there plenty discussion potential disruption payment space come ‘bigtechs’ – amazon, apple, google, facebook, alipay wechat pay. and digital currency – private sector central bank issued. although new method payment may extensively used, consumer increasingly aware them.graph 2but cash still important.the increase innovation payment system result substantial change way pay, yet still significant minority population continue use cash face-to-face payments. our recent consumer payment survey conduct late last year show still around 25 per cent consumer payment undertake use cash, account around 10 per cent value transaction (graph 3). and third survey respondent use cash payments, around 10 per cent use cash payments. cash user tend old people low incomes.graph 3covid-19 might ultimate disrupterenter covid-19. the anecdotal evidence suggest behavioural change. it come fast-changing consumer merchant payment preferences, change purchase behaviour response payment service provider facilitate change.both merchant consumer appear keen reduce use cash. many merchant make clear signage prefer contactless card payment, even low-value payments. some even go far indicate would accept cash. maybe partly response this, concern hygiene, many people reduce use cash stores. in addition, significant shift online shopping, cash simply payment option. a result changes, atm withdrawal april 30 per cent month 40 per cent low twelve month earlier.payment provider facilitate moves. the transaction limit pin require contactless card payment (temporarily) raise $100 $200 reduce need touch terminals. bank promote mobile payments, which, biometric identification, often require pin even large purchases. and bank also obtain dispensation mail debit card large number customer already them.all change likely result permanent shift behaviour people maintain new way things. people recently obtain debit card first time ability use card point sale well make online purchases. the increase use online shopping, either necessity preference ‘stay home' period, seem likely permanent shift. in response, many retailer increase online offer may even find reduce physical presence. there call ‘no pin’ limit maintain current high level, would make point-of-sale card payment even easier. and mobile payment probably receive permanent leg-up.there number policy implicationswe think policy implication change payment system time. many issue raise consultation document review retail payment regulation (the review). i go focus five issue here: cost electronic payments; technological lock-out; resilience electronic payments; access cash; future cheques.costs merchant electronic payment must keep low possiblethe cost payment merchant issue bank focus since give responsibility efficiency competition payment system 1998. from early day work interchange fees, bank concern way competition payment system works. in particular, since merchant reluctant refuse payment method consumer present, fear lose sale, typically take many possible. if sufficient number competitor take payment method, difficult merchant refuse payment mechanism. the result limit ability resist increase cost take payments. and cost payment rise, ultimately find price charge consumers.[1] while cash costless merchant accept, provide competitive pressure cost payment broadly. so cash use declines, even important ever ensure competitive pressure remain cost electronic payment merchants. there couple way competitive pressure manifest. the first use surcharging. merchant may feel refuse accept particular payment method. but may prepare signal customer costly impose surcharge use. they may even need surcharge – case simply threat surcharge may enough negotiate low fee payment provider.second, particularly relevant card payments, least-cost routing. least-cost rout put power hand merchant provide ability route dual-network debit card transaction network cost least accept. in australia, many merchants, eftpos network (graph 4). the evidence grow availability least-cost rout increase competition among card scheme reduction interchange fees, result low cost acceptance card payment merchants. graph 4but least-cost rout available couple years, widely promote major bank account acquire market australia. so many customer switch contactless response covid-19, merchant find payment cost rise debit card payment automatically rout international schemes. it therefore important merchant give option least-cost routing.so far, bank mandate acquirer explicitly offer least-cost rout merchants. but remain option consider review. in meantime, talk merchant understand experience payment cost period. we also consider transparency cost payment plan offer merchant could improved. ultimately though, market force generate competition low cost debit card payments, may need consider low benchmark serve cap average interchange fees. we need guard technological lock-outleast-cost rout work physical card present point-of-sale terminal provision two network – so-called dual-network debit cards. but physical card, case mobile payments? how encourage provision dual network circumstance encourage mobile terminal technology enable merchant choice routing. there already dispute area. some bank choose provision one debit system, option route limited. and dispute wing scheme-dependent tokenisation ‘card file’ transaction problem might create least-cost routing. a highlight consultation document, challenge area. but ultimately, bank stakeholder act way prevent downward pressure merchant fees, may need consider regulatory option keep cost electronic payment low.with people carry le cash,

national bank poland, online, 28 may 2020.* * *ladies gentlemen,welcome annual research conference national bank ukraine narodowybank polski. today’s event special. first, fifth anniversary conference. second, isheld online first time. third, discus sensitive topic especiallyimportant world today suffer coronavirus crisis: labor market andmonetary policy.although event remote, speaker participant around thirty country havegathered virtual room. indeed, topic year’s conference relevant anycountry.many country manage rein inflation attain low level unemployment pastdecades. however, economic inequality, population aging, migration, numerous otheraspects continue threaten economic development long-term macroeconomic stability ofthe world.let’s look key labor market trend shape global economy today.demographic trend go first. the development healthcare system allow people livelonger. however, insufficiently high birth rates, lead gradual population aging. asa result, increase pressure put social security system employee statebudgets case pension system mandatory contribution make generalpension fund.with globalization, labor market liberalization, conflict number countries, worldhas face great migration lower-income country country income arehigher. accord international organization migration, currently 272 millionmigrants world. the labor migrant account two third number.on one hand, global economy benefit economic migration. labor migrants’ hostcountries cover need labor force, attract young workers, experience increasein productivity entrepreneurial spirit, trait typical labor migrant thosewho stay home. in turn, migrants’ home country receive short-term dividend form ofremittances, rather stable compare financial inflows.on hand, international migration flip side: shortage labor force migrants’home countries, opposite pressure wage host home countries, increasedburden social security healthcare system – mention social politicalconsequences.another upside international migration help reduce global economic inequality.according world bank, inequality people world decline since 1990.however, benefit economic growth within country still distribute unevenly.according world bank, since 2008, economic inequality within country largelystopped rise due fact countries, along economic growth, income theless well-off 40% population increased. however, 40% population still 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech receive le 25% total income total population. thus, despite fairly positive trends,inequality within country still even high 25 year ago.the corona crisis case make thing worsethe great lockdown, already name crisis, lead sharp decline ineconomic growth. the global economy lose 3% real gdp year, accord imf. apartial recovery take place next year, gdp still pre-virus levels. but isonly possible pandemic eas quarantine measure gradually relax year,which highly uncertain.the coronavirus hit labor market hardest. due corona crisis globalworking hour second quarter may decrease 10.5 per cent compare last pre-crisis quarter. this equivalent 305 million full-time jobs. in addition, could jeopardize 1.6billion people work informal economy, half global workforce. theseare rather appal data international labor organization.the coronavirus seem discriminate rich poor, white-collar blue-collar workers. however, actual economic fallout pandemic isvery unevenly distributed. in today’s world, poor people, simple lower-paidthe job hold, rely job sole source income, themore suffer. previous pandemic crisis exacerbate inequality, thecorona crisis unlikely exception, accord recent study group economistsfrom center economic policy research. incidentally, opportunity hearone researcher tomorrow. the current crisis could even lead significantincrease economic inequality predecessors, pervasive profound thanprevious crises.unfortunately, ukraine familiar many problemswe expect unemployment ukraine peak 11.5% q2 2020 due corona crisis,compared 8.2% last year. a gradual ease quarantine measure start inmay continue economy recovers, unemployment also decline h2 2020, willremain high last year.the job loss hit ukrainian business close complicate jobsearch effort increase workload per vacancy, also show noeasy solution labor migration problem ukraine. some ukrainian work abroad noteven return home quarantine, particular fear prospect becomingjobless ukraine. they choose remain abroad temporarily unemployed cominghome struggle find work lockdown lifted. and returnare force compete “local” laid-off worker job rarely pay much asthese migrant earn countries. for reason, migrant worker leavingukraine search good pay since quarantine restriction partially relaxed.demand ukrainian worker poland, example, disappeared.however, problem ukrainian labor market relate covid-19.first, one systemic problem ukrainian economy year themismatch job seeker skill employer requirements.late last year, third company cite labor shortage one key factor limitingproduction, accord business surveys. this partially explain unemployment 2019was quite high despite significant demand labor businesses.not least role play fact ukrainian education system keep 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech change modern labor market, take place pressure ofglobalization technological progress. a result, accord state statistic service, inukraine third employee high education work profession notrequire such. this one high rate europe.• second, low productivity.despite grow past 15 years, productivity still low. ukraine top onehundred country ilo rank country productivity. in 2019, labor productivity inukraine low compare eu member states, also relative several formersoviet countries.• third, population decline aging.ukraine rank 12th world term population decline, accord world bank data.overall, ukraine 11 pensioner per 10 employees. a result, pension fund needsconstant additional contribution state budget. this divert public fund beingspent investment education, weigh potential gdp growth.the high workload employ individual increase already elevate level ofinformal employment. in 2019, one five worker ukraine employ informally. accordingto ilo forecast, 2024, burden work population dependent people willincrease compare 2019 even – 6%.• fourth, labor migration, i mention already.there exact data number ukrainian work abroad. however, accord tovarious estimates, 3 million people. some seasonal workers. last year, anaverage approximately 2.5 million citizen abroad give point time,according nbu estimates.for us, present double challenge. not labor migration affect quantity andquality labor resource labor productivity ukraine, also make economyheavily dependent remittances. ukraine rank 12th globally term total incomingremittances top 15 country remittance gdp ratio (not count islandstates).• fifth, low labor force participation.in particular, labor force participation woman ukraine insufficient compare europe.while labor force participation men population age 15 old 65%, ofwomen 49%. this due difficulty access childcare services, lowavailability part-time employment. in turn, low labor force participation put drag onpotential gdp growth.how monetary policy help cases?a dual mandate whereby central bank pursue price stability full employment notparticularly commonplace today’s world. the reserve bank australia u.s. federalreserve pursue dual mandate since post-war times, reserve bank newzealand since year ago.however, make monetary policy decision take labor market account notrequire dual mandate. in fact, effectiveness monetary policy depend deepunderstanding central bank mechanism govern labor markets. after all, beenproven close link wage growth inflation. and labor migration many 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech country significant impact inflation – labor supply wage throughremittances exchange rate.for example, rise labor migration ukraine 2016–2019, particular poland, wasone key factor fuel rapid increase wages. this lead growth inproduction cost thus prices, especially services. in addition, productivityis low, high wage make domestic producer le competitive, turn restrain economicgrowth. have consider conduct monetary policy? we certainly have.moreover, we, central banks, even standard “single” mandate theinflation target, care macroeconomic stability, economic growth, hence theunemployment rate.the task central bank strike balance keep inflation target level andpromoting economic growth. and current crisis shown, possible necessary tocontribute achievement goal time. however, give circumstances, isnecessary act decisively unconventionally.in recent months, see develop country near-zero interest rate resort tonontraditional monetary policy instruments. meanwhile, emerge economy still roomfor monetary ease rely standard tools.for instance, nbu do lot support economy corona crisis andto strengthen ability quickly get back foot it’s over. we slash keypolicy rate 11% 8% past two month rule possibility offurther cuts. we expand list bank liquidity support tool facilitate access tothese tools. we introduce long-term refinance bank period 1 5 year andan interest rate swap banks, make currency swap deal ebrd canprovide hryvnia loan ukrainian companies. we thus create condition whichbusinesses access fund affordable rates, short-term needs, also forlarge-scale business project require long-term investments. we take step toensure financial stability become another source problem economy.however, power central bank limits. can anything thedifferences people’s perception economic recovery?no, i don’t think can. i think leave national governments. in time asthese, central government ought prioritize fiscal incentives, include target measure tomaintain consumption level lose part income quarantine.like central bankers, ukraine provide favorable monetary environment andease financial market conditions.but good question ask, corona crisis give special relevance. we willhave two day discuss, particular, monetary policy affect economic inequality andwhether economic inequality among central bank’s goals. and talk it, weshould find answer fundamental question: dual mandate central banksjustified, appropriate focus inflation?thank attention. i wish fresh idea interest discussions! 4 / 4bis central bankers' speech i grateful gregory kidd help write speech, andrew bailey, jam benford, christine boykiw, ben

despite major new policy announcement federal reserve ecb. a i run gloomy update, clear action would need – perhaps stage quite much more. monday morning would quiet start andrew bailey, new governor. in remark today, i want give bird’s eye’s view happen extraordinary weeks, step take – either concert others, use balance sheet – neutralise sudden pre-lockdown 'dash cash' – big test core market function resilience since great financial crisis (gfc) 2008-9. judge solely narrow yardstick, central bank action – unprecedented scale speed – successful avert market meltdown. commercial banks, strengthen post-gfc reforms, continue lend, support range public sector schemes. and learn surprisingly positive thing operate financial system remotely – term market resilience, also term diversity inclusion. but time self-congratulation. the broad aspect covid-19 crisis – medical, social, economic, personal – remain hugely challenging, involve much wide set actor central bank alone. further financial instability cannot rule out. and sheer scale balance sheet intervention necessary recent month pose important long term questions. about extent non-bank financial system may still capable

already underway time, expectation slow demand cause global spread virus pull equity oil prices, investor move safe assets, reduce yield (chart 1). market function however mostly hold well. in recent days, however, something changed. wednesday see sharp intraday rise yield u treasury bond (usts) – normally one deep liquid market world – amidst big pickup market volumes. then, friday morning, yield 30-year usts fell 7 basis point le 15 minutes. more worryingly, normally reliable relationship usts relate financial instrument begin unravel. what seem happen financial transaction normally help stabilise ust market go reverse, become stress-amplifiers. in recent years, hedge fund leverage investor take role maintain so-called ‘arbitrage relationships’ financial instrument trade line one another. they number way – particularly popular trade involve so-called ‘futures basis’: buy usts, fund repo, sell bond future large asset manager eager pick return. these trade conduct thin margin high rate leverage.1 the sharp pickup asset price volatility, market struggle process news onset virus, increase margin call – force fund unwind basis trades, sell usts generate cash. initially trade conduct quietly. but time go on, speed size – run hundred billion dollar – begin overwhelm dealers’ intermediation capacity, shrink result rise volatility operational challenge remote working. rise transaction cost breakdown arbitrage relationship begin feed themselves: classic ‘doom loop’ (chart 2). what unique process, potentially disastrous financial system, even high quality government asset

governor bank russia, follow-up boardof director meeting, moscow, 24 april 2020.* * *today, board director decide cut key rate 50 bp 5.50%per annum. this imply switch accommodative monetary policy.moreover, hold open prospect key rate reduction situationdevelops line update baseline forecast bank russia.our today’s decision base profound revision view economic developmentand inflation trend next three years.since last board directors’ revision key rate, three event happen whichhave define view situation. they primarily associate spreadof coronavirus pandemic. firstly, drastic decline global economy. secondly,there another round slump oil prices, despite new opec+ deal. thirdly,the government introduce nation-wide restrictions. a result, large numberof business suspend operation switch remote work mode.a lot citizen currently self-isolation.as positive factors, i would focus slight stabilisation global financial marketsas compare march, largely drive measure implement centralbanks reserve-currency countries.therefore, give developments, completely review economic forecast.our today’s decision rely exactly forecast, late statisticswe receiving. the statistic still show previous month’s situation cannot providea clear view estimate trends. build forecast, rather take accountleading indicator economic situation, include data electric power consumption,financial flows, household spending, well experience country wherethe pandemic spread long period.i dwell main assumption behind baseline forecast.our forecast rely conservative view oil prices, especially 2020. we assume theywill slowly grow average level usd 15 per barrel second quarterto usd 25 per barrel fourth quarter. there large oil stock accumulated, downfallin global demand. this limit recovery oil prices, even new opec+ agreementis fully comply with. further on, oil price expect gradually rise usd 45 per barrelin 2022 global demand pick oil stock level decrease.another key assumption forecast duration coronavirus pandemicand restriction implement russia abroad. our estimate suggest thatgovernments gradually lift considerably ease majority current restrictionsin second quarter. in case, expect third fourth quarter economicactivity recover quarter-on-quarter.the economic situation return normal step-by-step. the direct adverse impactof restriction primarily fall quarter, secondary effect continueto manifest future. accord surveys, 80% business across variousindustries experience influence coronavirus pandemic current 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech

quarters, annual rate economic growth willbe negative.according bank russia’s forecast, gdp overall decrease 4–6% 2020.the major contributor reduction decline export may reachfrom 10% 15%. moreover, fix capital investment also substantially decrease (by 6–10%) compare previous year. company primarily use financial resourcesto restore daily operations. uncertainty prospect domestic externaldemand confine investment plans. the decline production investment willbe confine opportunity upturn income. consumer demand shrinking.the measure implement government bank russia supportthe economy, specifically affect industries.economic growth 2021–2022 largely recovery-type. accord forecast, gdp willexpand 3–5% 2021 1.5–3.5% 2022. gdp growth promote furtherimplementation national projects. however, baseline forecast factor alreadyeffective budget support measures.an upturn economy domestic demand also drive ease monetaryconditions result monetary policy pursued. this support lending, growthrate rise 3–8% year 6–11% 2021–2022. the lend potential alsobe maintain owe regulatory ease expansion bank russia’sspecialised refinance instruments.according estimates, ease monetary policy need maintainannual inflation close 4% forecast horizon. the slump domestic externaldemand year considerably contain inflation, induce risk substantialdeviation downwards target 2021 medium-term horizon additionalmonetary policy measure introduced.the disinflationary pressure weak demand offset effect temporary proinflationaryfactors, is, ruble weaken observe elevate demand individual products,already year. we believe rise inflation expectation cause factor willalso temporary.we expect impact limit demand inflation stable long-lasting. giventhe transmission lag monetary policy, take action already now. basedon forecast, annual inflation reach 3.8–4.8% end year amid easingof monetary policy, stabilise close 4%. moreover, expect reversalof inflation trend middle year. monthly inflation annualised term beginto go down, annual inflation still continue rise.as balance payments, expect current account balance declineto negative value 2020 2021 (to usd 35 18 billion respectively). this mainlyresult slump export cause reduction external demand exportrevenues, primarily oil sales.i would like point temporary switch current account deficit expect effectproduced considerable oil price downturn influence fiscal rule. receiptsfrom fiscal rule-based foreign currency sale make possible support economyand domestic consumption. in situation, import contract low degree compare 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech export drive decline oil prices. a result, current account balance dropto negative values. in 2022, oil price exceed cut-off level, current accountbalance return positive territory accumulation reserve resume via fiscalrule-based foreign currency purchases.we expect noticeable change private sector financial account balance overthe forecast horizon. accord estimates, private sector financial account deficit willreduce usd 18 billion 2019 usd 15 billion year. this link decline gdp,decrease economic revenues, well le possibility borrow foreign marketsat end first quarter — start second quarter amid intensify volatilityand uncertainty. further ahead, global market stabilise, potential external bollowingswill recover pas reduction private sector financial account deficitto usd 10 billion 2021–2022.this baseline scenario, without doubt, many uncertainty factors. they concern boththe duration restriction russia worldwide, pace recovery globaland russian economies. besides, new spike volatility may occur global financialand commodity markets. therefore, discussion key rate decision path,we proper regard objective sustain financial stability.as i noted, baseline forecast incorporate fiscal decision already madeby government. we assume situation may require additional decisionsto support economy. this foster alleviation effect restriction householdsand businesses, accelerate return economic activity normal, also mitigate risksof inflation deviation downwards target next quarters. in courseof key rate discussions, consider model estimate influence additionalfiscal measure gdp, inflation monetary policy path.we certainly consider possible development fiscal policy, russian globaleconomies course adjustment baseline scenario. nonetheless,our current analysis suggest virtually possible scenario variant allow monetarypolicy easing, include amid certain additional expansion fiscal measure designedto support economy.the board director proceed exist potential cuttingthe key rate discuss possible option current next meetings. the discussionconcluded give extraordinary developments, may prove sufficient adjustour policy employ small-step method used. to return inflation targetand stabilise situation economy, may need implement decisive measures.at today’s meet decide cut key rate 50

german constitutional court question legality ecb’spublicsector purchase programme — pspp — generate great deal confusion andconcern.the court find that, launch pspp early 2015, ecb exceed mandate; thecourt order deutsche bundesbank stop participate execution pspp aftera transitional period three months, “unless ecb govern council adopt new decisionthat demonstrate comprehensible substantiate

legal one. the german court’s rule effectively challenge 2018 rulingby european court justice pspp legal. which court — germanconstitutional court, national tribunal, european court justice — primacy inmatters relate european institutions?because rule german court create great deal uncertainty, issue oflegal primacy need reaffirmed.i leave distinguish -speakers address issue legal perspective.the second principle concern independence ecb. it principle i wish toaddress.in connection, i discus three issues: first, rationale central bank independence;second, ecb’s mandate; third, context decision undertake pspp.on independence, important reason ecb make independent centralbank inception 1999.numerous study 1980s 1990s compare central bank performance hadfound independent central bank — prime example deutsche bundesbank —performed much good central banks. independent central bank deliver lowerunemployment low inflation others free political pressures.independence, however, mean absence accountability. the ecb may beindependent, also accountable. for example, president ecb regularly appearsbefore european parliament explain justify ecb’s policies. like nationalcentral bank governors, i provide testimony regular basis national parliament.with regard mandate, ecb freely decide design implementation thesingle monetary policy euro area. article 127 maastricht treaty assign ecbthe primary objective price stability.1 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech an important reason underlie objective price stability following. in absence ofunforeseen event — pandemic example unforeseen event — price stability helpsto deliver full employment society, is, help ensure people work fullcapacity without build-up inflationary pressures.in words, although price stability ecb’s primary objective, objective isunderpinned aim provide maximum number job opportunity citizen ofthe euro area.in context, monetary policy euro area exercise uniform way. give singlecharacter monetary policy, might indeed case monetary policy decisionsoccasionally le “fitting / suitable” country others.does mean national central bank euro area potentially order byits high national court abstain implement

backdrop alarming. inflation negative territory threat ofprolonged low inflation — deflation — rising. why concern? for one thing,deflation reduce consumer investment spending. it also mean individual afixed amount debt see debt rise real terms.history show country experience deflation undergo prolong economichardship. the great depression begin unite state 1929 mark deflation;real output recover 1929 level 1941, light build-up militaryspending world war ii.not deflation euro area threat, unemployment rate increase 11.5per cent.and let u forget another ominous threat horizon — reappearance

stoppedseptember 29, 2020michael held, executive vice president general counselremarks imn virtual investors' conference liborthank kind introduction, opportunity speak today. a always,my remark reflect view necessarily federal reserve bank newyork federal reserve system.the last time i speak publicly libor transition almost 18 month ago, end oflibor still seem reasonably far away world general seem much predictable. isaid keep night whether daughter would get goodkindergarten brooklyn, reference rate reform little list.you’ll relieve know daughter great school, it’s close home. infact, it’s live room. a year half ago, i never could anticipate different anduncertain every single part life would become. now, there’s whole host new worriesatop list thing keep night. i’m sure that’s true well, asindividuals family also leader institution deal bizarre uncertaintimes find in. those new concern risk understandably push many well-laid plan background, pandemic far-reaching effect sort ofthings think know would happen become uncertain. what i want today isremind despite everything else that’s happening, end libor still coming.exactly happen still uncertain, best response uncertainty tomorrow isto take decisive action today.since speech last year, substantial progress address theuncertainties surround libor transition, even new uncertainty arisen. now, manylawyers love uncertainty. if everything crystal clear, would spend time arguingabout?i say end libor present rather frightening—or awe inspiring, dependingon perspective—litigation risk. but it’s litigation risk. the libor transitionencompasses whole panoply risks. yes, legal risk, also operational risk, credit risk,regulatory risk, reputational risk, name it—libor all. so possibility fail libortransition something keep u night.but let’s try stay positive rather dark times—let’s talk progress beenmade, minimize uncertainty remain. my remark focuson transition unite state u.s. dollar libor, i touch internationaldevelopments relevant transition.libor: the end errorsome people ask whether end libor push somehow allow timefor transition. some people, i suspect, may even hope end case. after all, thetask daunting. but i would remind folk adage “why today put off12 30/09/2020the libor countdown ha not stop - federal reserve bank new yorkhttps://.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2020/hel2009292/6until tomorrow?” quite opposite. indeed, ’s financial conduct authority (fca) hasreiterated pandemic alter central assumption firm cannot rely onlibor publish end 2021. in fact, fca say even though liborwill continue then, announcement end could come early november ordecember. the financial stability board (fsb)—which chair randy quarles, federalreserve board’s vice chair supervision—has also emphasize pandemic notprevent firm remove remain dependency libor end 2021.the alternative reference rate committee (arrc), private-sector committeeconvened federal reserve facilitate transition away u.s. dollar libor, hasrecommended floating-rate notes, syndicate loans, consumer loans, securitizationsshould already include definitive fallback cope end libor, set target datesby new libor-based product issued. the arrc also provide timelineand resource ensure vendor operational system ready switch toalternative

make sure provide end libor clear terms. do notwait state cavalry ride rescue.in , government say give fca new power smooth transition, andthere speculation fca powers. the  legislation takesa different approach propose new york law. it raise prospect liborcontinuing new methodology “synthetic libor,” least currencies. but thefca warn whatever alternative firms’ transition efforts,and synthetic continuation libor still deem representativerate. the fca say action take focus contract cannot feasibly beamended party mitigate effect libor cessation. it provide solution fornew

considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html1/7speechthe monetary policy strategy review: somepreliminary considerationsspeech christine lagarde, president ecb, “ecb it watcher xxi” conferencefrankfurt main, 30 september 2020thank invite address conference. this morning, i would like speak theecb’s strategy review, reason conduct it, expectation result it.since 2003, last conduct strategy review, euro area world economy haveundergone profound changes. the consensus govern monetary policy worldwide beenchallenged number fronts.most importantly, last decade define persistent decline inflation among advancedeconomies. in euro area, annual inflation average 2.3% 1999 eve great financialcrisis august 2008, 1.2% end 2019.this environment pose fundamental question central banks. we need thoroughly analyse theforces drive inflation dynamic today, consider whether adjust ourpolicy strategy response. to inform analysis, also want hear wide variety ofstakeholders – include citizens, academics, parliamentarian civil society organisation – abouthow perceive goal actions. this launch “ecb listens” programme, inwhich aim listen many voice possible.as restart strategy review – put hold coronavirus (covid-19)pandemic strike – i present conclusion today. now time listen andreflecting. but i discus main issue look key question beasking.in remark today i cover three topics: first, definition inflation objective; second, therelationship inflation real economy; third, transmission effectiveness ofmonetary policy. none issue consider isolation need well-rounded view ofall element order draw conclusion strategy review.the inflation objectivei start inflation objective anchor inflation process whole economy. threeissues feature particularly prominently review.the first formulate inflation aim.the argument favour central bank aim positive inflation rate sufficient buff awayfrom zero articulate strategy review 2003. it compensate possible measurementbias, help country rebalance economy within monetary union create buff againstdeflation, well lead high nominal interest rate medium term. that help ensure thatmonetary policy force often towards effective low bind – level interest rate atwhich cut desire positive impact – face shock push inflationtoo low.since 2003, ecb use double-key formulation set objective, define price stability ayear-on-year increase inflation “below 2%”, aim inflation “below, close to, 2%”. 30/09/2020the monetary policy strategy review: preliminary considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html2/7this formulation appropriate time ecb seek establish credibility too-highinflation main worry. a research shows, key factor successfully cap inflationexpectations.[1]but current environment low inflation, concern face different need bereflected inflation aim. ensure sufficient space zero re-empowerconventional monetary policy become important. and, underpin inflation expectations, needto ensure aim perceive symmetric public. so inflation aim thatthe public easily understand.the second issue horizon price stability achieved, capture bythe ecb’s “medium term” orientation. this forward-looking orientation reflect traditional well-established principle prudent monetary policy, consistent notion monetary policyworks lag influence inflation medium term rather near term.but within ecb’s framework, medium-term orientation also way governingcouncil take account happen real economy, include employment. we ahierarchical mandate price stability top. but medium term, flexible concept,allows u avoid unnecessarily constrict job growth event supply shock whichtemporarily push inflation generate economic slump.the low inflation environment create new question operationalise medium term.for instance, existence large persistent disinflationary shock relate to, say, ability tocompare price actively via internet diversify supplier likely call flexibility. buta persistent failure meet inflation aim fee inflation expectation would call ashorter policy horizon.we also need reflect two pillar approach assess development economy, whichuses economic monetary analysis. cross-check two help determine risk toprice stability. the monetary pillar could principle enhance provide information financialstability – long time horizon – could relevant inflation outlook.central bank also consider add backward-looking element policy horizon responseto low inflation environment. in ecb’s case, reference underlie inflation dynamic ourforward guidance mean already look past decide whether change policy. thewider discussion today, however, whether central bank commit explicitly make forinflation miss spend quite time inflation goals.if credible, strategy strengthen capacity monetary policy stabilise economy whenfaced low bound. this promise inflation overshoot raise inflationexpectations therefore low real interest rates.[2] while make-up strategy may le successfulwhen people perfectly rational decisions[3] – probably good approximation thereality face – usefulness approach could examined.the third issue measure inflation lie behind inflation aim.the harmonise index consumer price (hicp) serve u well far continuously beingimproved. example improvement include account quality change, annual changesin consumption weights, granular category expenditure timely data.at time, economy change increasingly quickly. we need keep track broadconcepts inflation capture cost people face everyday life reflect theirperceptions, include measure owner-occupied housing. this move goalpost formonetary policy. it future-proofing measure inflation. but also need recognise thatadjustments present issue term reliability frequency data.likewise, get good sense evolution hicp medium term, need tocomplement analysis also look cyclical le volatile measure inflation, asunderlying inflation. the public rightly expect u defend purchase power money 30/09/2020the monetary policy strategy review: preliminary considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html3/7why target overall hicp. but underlie inflation measure responsive economic slackand tend good predict inflation medium term.the relationship inflation real economyif anchor inflation inflation aim, phillips curve – link real economy andinflation – play central role allow central bank steer inflation towards aim. but lowinflation environment, price appear become le responsive real economy. ecb researchsuggests empirical phillips curve remain intact, may rather flat.[4]broadly speaking, three factor might explain inflation respond weakly improvement theeconomy run-up pandemic.the first possibility economic slack – amount underused resource economy – waslarger thought. the second possibility relationship slack inflation wasobscured persistent structural forces. and third anchor inflation expectation mighthave loosened, affect inflation settle demand supply shock pass andslack converge zero.the intuition behind first factor phillips curve alive well, euro area face aseries large shock make hard measure economic activity relative potential. since itis distance full employment matter term move inflation phillips curve, thatdistance underestimate inflation may remain subdue even measure slack get smaller.there numerous potential cause mismeasurement, including: measure unemploymentthat ignore effect part-time work underemployment[5]; revision potential output whichmistook cyclical change structural trends[6]; failure fully account external factor addedto euro area slack, relative demand imbalance link trade surplus.[7] research supportssuch role “hidden slack”. since 2011, study assume output gap much largerhave, general, outperform use traditional estimates.[8]what striking, though, run-up pandemic saw labour market slack diminish andwages finally rising, without inflation pick up. in fact, ecb research find missingwage inflation recent years. what saw instead slow pass-through wage prices,because company prefer compress margin rather pas cost rises.[9] for monetary policy,it matter whether firm expect slow demand, affectedby persistent structural change distort historical regularities.this bring second factor: long-running structural forces. how could weakenedthe link real economy inflation thereby require revise approach monetarypolicy?it clear globalisation lift global labour supply, sharpen competition cause firm setprices strategically. globalisation also go hand hand digitalisation, increase pricetransparency enable many industry reduce costs. in theory, factor could havedepressed price inflation, even wage growth support productivity gain fromtechnology. in parallel, adverse demographic advance economy may lead high savingrates structurally weak demand.[10]research suggest force affect inflation euro area recent decades. a recentstudy find global factors, global commodity prices, global slack producer pricecompetition, significantly affect inflation.[11] ecb research also find digitalisation beendisinflationary euro area: since 2006, e-commerce lead average yearly decrease non-energy industrial good inflation 0.06 percentage points.[12] and empirical evidence suggest ashrinking working-age population may depress inflation.[13] 30/09/2020the monetary policy strategy review: preliminary considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html4/7at time, structural force need net deflationary, particularly aftermath thecovid-19 pandemic. while globalisation digitalisation tend pull direction overthe past 20 years, conceivable might pull opposite directions. the pandemic mightboth trigger de-globalisation – protectionism rise firm shorten supply chain increaseoperational resilience – accelerate expansion digital economy. change globaldemographics might also reduce global labour supply.[14]in addition, active countercyclical role fiscal policy pandemic may strengthen inflationdynamics. and factor renew focus mitigate climate change, too, could havean impact inflation progressive change energy mix transition towards carbon-neutral economy. climate change affect aspect monetary policy: output inflation, long-terminterest rate policy transmission. that carefully study implication climatechange primary objective part strategy review.in event, structural factor last negative impact inflation seepinto inflation expectations. this lead third factor may explain apparent disconnectbetween real economy inflation. empirically, straightforward gauge anchor ofinflation expectations. there differ interpretation depend approach use defineanchoring, well measure horizon inflation expectation considered.that said, market-based measure longer-term inflation expectation fall notably, even whenadjusted various risk premia distort picture. those measure also become moreresponsive short-term news, interpret sign anchor softened.survey-based measure remain le within range consistent ecb’s aim (i.e. 1.7-1.9%),but also move bottom range since 2019.for actual process set wage prices, expectation public matter most.since last strategy review research consumer firm form theirinflation expectations. while data still scarce noisy, general picture consumer holdvery diverse expectation inflation appear far le well anchor aim othermeasures inflation expectations. in 2015 average perceive inflation among euro area household wasjust 5%, actual inflation 0.3%.the generally high level household expectation necessarily cause comfort, however.what emerge research area household take long time absorb newinformation inflation, expectation adjust hard dislodge – thedirection people perceive inflation head affect economic decisions.[15]this process course exogenous monetary policy: greatly influence central bank’sobjective policy conduct communicate pursuit objective. this thediscussion numerical definition price stability instrument support overtime important.clearly, three factor i discuss mutually exclusive. so crucial gain muchdeeper understand relevance interaction order draw appropriate conclusion howwe conduct monetary policy. a part this, need understand might interactedwith monetary policy approach low bound. this bring final area i would like discusstoday: monetary policy transmission effectiveness.monetary policy transmission effectivenessas monetary policy everywhere approach low bound, major central bank facedquestions policy space traction tool economy.a key challenge long-term fall estimate natural interest rate. the natural rate theunobservable interest rate bring desire save investment balance, put anotherway, bring output close potential. monetary policy accommodative policy rate isbelow natural rate, restrictive policy rate it. estimate natural rate theeuro area drop 0.6% 2.2% average 1999 2011, -1.3% 30/09/2020the monetary policy strategy review: preliminary considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html5/7and 0.5% thereafter.[16] this require progressively low policy rate order ease monetarypolicy – even prevent unchanged policy stance become restrictive.central bank around world show barrier stabilise economy. beforethe pandemic, ecb able offset effect decline natural rate take depositfacility rate negative territory deploy forward guidance asset purchase easefinancing condition long maturities. indeed, asset purchase – compress longer-term bondyields – induce ease financial condition partly compensate diminish scopefor conventional rate cuts. we also launch series target longer-term refinance operations(tltros) strengthen pass-through measure via bank real economy.the effect financial condition real economy significant. consider themeasures take since mid-2014, overall impact euro area real gdp growth estimate havebeen 2.5 3 percentage point cumulatively 2019, impact inflation isestimated 1.7 2 percentage point cumulatively period.the response pandemic provide evidence effectiveness. our pandemic emergencypurchase programme (pepp) new series tltros prove powerful tool forstabilising finance condition stimulate credit growth.[17] accord ecb staff estimates, themeasures take since march year increase inflation around 0.8 percentage pointscumulatively 2020 2022, gdp growth around 1.3 percentage points.however, reflect happen natural rate remain low inflation stay subdue –meaning central bank continue resort frequently balance sheet policy deliver theirmandates. this scenario throw two issue need consider deeply.the first standardise toolkit world unconventional policy is“normal”. the implicit assumption since 2008 policy “normalisation” mean returningmainly interest rate policy wind unconventional policies. but “normal” close whatwe saw outbreak pandemic and, i afraid, see even vividly now,we need prepared. we need clear consensus – agree within govern council andunderstood public – tool available u inflation low, theyshould systematically deploy response different type shock.so need understand transmission channel different instruments, toevaluate relative side effects, intend unintended, work way theeconomy. a central question extent different tool substitute complement andtheir potential non-linearities – is, effectiveness might change time differenteconomic conditions.we already evidence substitutability. for example, ecb research find without useof large-scale asset purchase since 2015, deposit facility rate would fall around -2%to achieve path inflation observed. this level would probably triggered“reversal rate” dynamics, situation rate cut would become contractionary harm thebusiness model financial intermediary disrupt monetary policy transmission.[18]conversely, instrument display complementarities. think, example, tltros andour negative rate policy. the former able leverage power latter channel thestimulative impulse associate sub-zero rate directly banks. unlike “reversal rate” scenario,this promote credit creation – bank borrow low interest rate tltros onlyon condition lend – without hurt banks’ profitability impair monetarytransmission.the second issue need reflect interaction monetary fiscal policies. whencentral bank use balance sheet policy extensively, inevitable strengthen theinterplay monetary fiscal policies. this interaction work ways.fiscal policy empower monetary policy foster demand, brighten economic prospect forfirms. this encourage borrow allow fully benefit monetary policy stimulus.and monetary policy make fiscal policy effective, monetary policy low 30/09/2020the monetary policy strategy review: preliminary considerationshttps://.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2020/html/ecb.sp200930~169abb1202.en.html6/7bound – commit stay via forward guidance rate asset purchase – fiscalmultipliers higher.[19]indeed, one explanation superior inflation performance unite state relative euroarea recent time monetary fiscal policy aligned. from 2013 2018, fiscalpolicy euro area tighten around 2.5 percentage point gdp, compare loosen ofaround 0.8 percentage point unite states. ecb analysis euro area find that, whilemonetary policy support inflation period, offset demand headwinds.the implication that, current environment, policy must remain expansionary long asnecessary achieve respective goals. and, disinflationary condition economy isrunning short potential, goal policy naturally aligned.but monetary fiscal policy interact closely, also raise important question –questions become even acute aftermath pandemic. these include setpolicy world possibly permanently high level public debt, appropriate design ofeurope’s fiscal framework.since restart strategy review, introduce new work stream monetary-fiscalinteractions precisely address questions.conclusionlet conclude.today i lay preliminary consideration guide strategy review. at stage, itis early draw firm conclusions. rather, i attempt identify key issue thegoverning council aim address.there one issue, however, i decisive today: must explain much good thegeneral public why, must talk people normally reach.this imperative cascade element review: inflation aim, inflationmeasure, tool effectiveness, take account new challenge peoplecare about, like climate change inequality.i fully commit vision. monetary policy credible ensure goal aretruly understand share people serve. a independent central bank, willremain accountable

bank in the heart of the ecosystem » contact presse : mark deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr), déborah guedj (deborah.guedj@banque-france.fr) page 2 sur 10 good morning welcome webinar, jointly organize official monetary financial institution forum banque de france. what good way demonstrate digital transformation hold event cyberspace. it common recent year hear disruptive technology past 6 months, information technology instead crucial source continuity highly disrupt world. digitalization one among many factor transform central bank broad theme morning. the ecb strategic review rightly launch christine lagarde, explicit list challengesii, opportunity reflect eurosystem respond them. the shock hit economy past decade unprecedented, hindsight, many long-term structural shift occur cause unstable complex situation face today. global natural interest rate already fall since early 1980s drive demographic transition risk-aversion key emerge markets. digitalisation globalisation, combined, press “lowflation”. financial vulnerability also steadily, invisibly, rise since so-called great moderation. indeed, seem excess demand show asset price wage inflation, complicate trade-off price stability financial stability. however, would remiss briefly mention short-term challenge currently face. confront unprecedented covid crisis, act boldly rapidly, use tool disposal invent new one pepp. by so, successfully avoid fragmentation deflation. that said, inflation yet would like be, back towards 2% medium term. have doubt determination act much needed, capacity act. again autumn, hear chatter ecb run ammunition. it prove completely wrong march, remain wrong today. if needed, ecb ample room manœuvre. by page 3 sur 10 way, yesterday's take (eur 174 bn) tltro-3 confirm attractiveness adequacy innovative tool. we decide keep steady hand last govern council due continuity economic forecasts. but steady hand tie hands: free hand future. ** let come ecb’s strategic review, work restart peak covid crisis. it extensive fomc’s cover, among many things, structural change; climate change; financial stability; effect digitalization. the eurosystem take time, feed did, consider different alternatives. what professional economist find theoretically appeal may either easily applicable comprehensible general public. what financial market expect short run always consistent long-term economic objectives. but let try today share preliminary think four key questions: 1. be difference dual mandate ecb’s two-tiered mandate? 2. how could clarify inflation objective? 3. what “second pillar” ecb link so-called “secondary” objectives? 4. last least, improve communication general public economic actors? my aim obviously give conclusive answer four question highlight important element debate. the fed’s conclusion significant part one shouldn’t assume ecb simply follow suit. other contribution – ecb listen exercise, academic roundtables, sintra current review bank canada – also important difference always expected. page 4 sur 10 1. be difference mandates? for observers, include politicians, strike issue: feed dual mandate, include price stability maximum employment, strategy review shift emphasis latter. the ecb, meanwhile, primary objective price stability, accord treaties. of course duty stick treaty strategic review won’t deviate inch them. however let remind legal mandate not, often assumed, purely “single mandate”: rather two-tiered one include least two objective without prejudice price stability: “to support general economic policy union” contribute among aim “social market economy, aim full employment social progress”iii; “the stability financial system”iv furthermore, i would argue le difference dual mandate flexible inflation target people think: noticeably, measure take offset effect negative shock global financial crisis sanitary crisis direct effect growth employment. a far demand shock concerned, monetary policy prescription same. in principle conflict supply shock inflation target central bank also tend react temporary supply shock respond sign second-round effects. the ecb also take note estimate natural rate unemployment recognize subject enormous uncertainty – like estimate “natural” variables. the ecb would tighten policy base solely estimate unemployment gap. 2. how could clarify price stability objective? the main substantive change fomc introduction inflation make-up strategy. rather solely forward-looking, fomc will, could, correct past inflation shortfalls. let u also discus area page 5 sur 10 continuity jay powell speech 27 augustv – possible differences:  the feed confirm common strategy inflation target keep 2% numerical goal. this “conceptual convergence” remain cornerstone modern central banking.  average inflation target flexible tactic, possibly temporary, within wide strategy keep inflation sustainably expected. still importantly view, inflation target perceive flexible, symmetric medium term. allow bite specific three requirements. flexible obvious one. we cannot guarantee achieve precisely numerical objective either time straight away. symmetric mean numerical objective target ceiling. a consequence might ready accept inflation high 2% time, without mechanically trigger tighten monetary stance. commentator sometimes attribute perceive asymmetry current definition price stability “below, close to, 2%”. the govern council frequently re-affirmed commitment symmetry – stand introductory statement since mario draghi. nevertheless, examine whether current formulation cast doubt this. medium term mean judge inflation performance long enough period. we shouldn’t forget jean-claude trichet often stress optimal performance first year euro. “over 12 years, average annual inflation rate euro area 1.97%. we achieve price stability euro area already quite long horizon.”vi a i say previous occasionsvii, medium-term target need view two ways: forward look guide inflation expectations, cannot ignore past either. page 6 sur 10 all explicit average inflation target ex ante, would achieve similar outcome ex post. we discus that.  we also discus precise formulation inflation objective, least two respects: “below close to” already mention measure inflation use. continuity positive asset inclusion “owner-occupied housing” hicp frequently, somewhat rightly, suggest general public. a aware, prefer inflation measure fed, pce index, include expenditures.  last least, inflation objective clarify also credible. i come back fourth question communication. 3. what second pillar ecb link “secondary objectives”? for many, history second pillar monetary analysis ecb seem come end. bear first pillar 1999 come time strict follow monetary aggregate bundesbank – banque de france well –, become second pillar 2003, pass behind economic analysis inflation outlook. and due fact progressively fall disuse, many suggest call time strategic review. be sure? isn’t another alternative path, adequate let disappear? there three possible reasons:  the second pillar allow cross check analysis inflation.  we could possibly introduce focus nominal aggregates, whereas first pillar focus nature price volumes.  finally, would allow reference “secondary” objective ecb, include financial stability. in discussion come, i believe could study two type aggregates: page 7 sur 10  financial aggregates, perspective financial stability, potentially look closely asset financial institution include non-banks (such provision credit broad sense) rather liability (including money, past).  other economic aggregates, start nominal gdp, virtue combine real growth price – two variable statistician sometimes difficulty separate measures. but also employment income distribution, respond demand treaty well expectation public. allow remark substance “secondary” objectives. to achieve financial stability, ideal world, would box macroprudential tool could maintain financial stability whatever monetary policy stance. however, practice set macroprudential tool comparatively limited. we need monetary policy strategy reflect reality. we go beyond old debate “separation principle” versus “ lean wind”. i advocate median way, could call “coordinated” “integrated”.viii we range unconventional monetary instrument objective pick right combination deliver necessary accommodative monetary stance minimize adverse side-effects financial stability. tltro’s tiering system use today refinance eurozone bank two good example respect. on climate change, emphasis put christine lagardeix welcome totally warranted. in view, fight global warm already imperative u price stability mandate: effect climate change significant repercussion future inflation growth, already impact now. we could implement climate decision 3 5 years, would make u pioneer among major central banks. page 8 sur 10 4. how improve communication general public? my final remark concern communication. central bank come long way transparent decision explain reasoning. however, communication often address narrow group people – media, market economists. we need good job reach general public. and mean two change paradigm:  question democratic accountability – however essential remain –, also key economic efficiency. better-informed firm household also make good decision one align strategy, i come back it.  secondly, evolve narrow objective “transparency” wide objective “clarity”. this mean focus hear rather said: cannot merely “publish go”. a tiff macklem, canadian colleague, say “public communication plain language free jargon. we speak public servant peers, oracle deliver message ivory tower.”x and effective speak also require active listening. at start next year, consistent ecb endeavours, host number “banque de france listens” event region hear french citizen smes think inflation monetary policy. we adjust communication depend hear. let elaborate economic stake communication. our inflation target policy significantly efficient economic agents, household businesses, actually understand it, accept believe it. hence see clear, legitimate credible. i insist early clarification (question 2), let conclude legitimacy credibility. one difficult challenge central bank price stability mandate explain positive inflation objective. the general public often understand central bank would deliberately try increase inflation. we need explain good although price stability objective page 9 sur 10 define term hicp inflation, actually seek general average increase nominal variables, include wage nominal gdp. few people spontaneously want increase consumer prices, want increase nominal incomes. furthermore, households, firms, financial institution government enter nominal contract (negotiate wages, take mortgages, buy sovereign debt etc) base expect inflation. if actual inflation high low expectations, wealth income transfer one group other. the best way neutral announce target efficiently guide expectations. to non-economist, price stability would imply target zero inflation. however, need explain target zero inflation ideal. real wage adjustment necessary maintain competitiveness sustain employment real adjustment easy achieve positive inflation rate. this still important monetary union real adjustment necessary maintain internal balance. the effective low bind (elb) nominal interest rate would also reach frequently, put constraint use monetary policy. but i acknowledge use elb argument at, say family lunch sunday, easy say done. last least, credibility. here, household firm mix feelings: believe actual inflation much high central bank statistic institute claim; doubt deliver “close 2%”in future. distrust often name game. here, let u listen speak. first listen inflation expectation household firms: don’t measure properly today, although essence economic transmission monetary policy, household firm actual price- wage-setters. indeed, price expectation quite different financial market tend focus on. listen speak: central bank commit target, must use every tool available deliver explain clearly transmission monetary impulse economy entail delays. we page 10 sur 10 convince credible inflation objective make stabilize inflation easy objective anchor inflation expectations. let u convince fellow citizen determination, “in plain language” – i hope remark today help somewhat initiate essential debate conduct conclude ecb strategy review. thank attention. références ii would

governor, bank of ghana 14th september 2020 2 fellow governor deputy governor afi network afi executive director dr. alfred hannig, afi management staff member afi network invite guest lady gentlemen, i honour deliver close remark remarkable insightful webinar. i believe webinar do seek do, provide platform share experience lesson learn pandemic response far help chart way forward towards gender-inclusive measure spur economic recovery efforts. at begin webinar, hear remark governor ernest addison dr. hannig thought-provoking, lay perfect foundation stimulate discussion ensued. the plenary session breakout group discussion effectively address issue pertain five key pillar (i) women, regulation, regulatory institutions; (ii) women’s participation business job market; 3 (iii) woman social protection; (iv) woman access financial service include dfs; (iv) woman consumer protection. the experience share today’s discussion confirm pandemic disproportionately affect women, push formal informal employment business, case financial system, widen gender gap access finance. in many countries, covid-related restriction come high price woman men, give woman tend involve informal, temporary, part-time work, informal business partly due domestic responsibility disproportionately shoulder. what more, pre-existing gender gap access finance mean many woman adversely impact pandemic little save cushion access credit grant save business collapse. indeed, phenomenon limit develop world. advance economy also grapple distributional consequence pandemic. for example, recent work paper, imf find evidence woman japan negatively impact pandemic due disparity labour market fact woman men drop job market take care child amidst 4 massive disruption childcare schools. the imf advocate policy promote good work-life balance gender equality help enhance female employment opportunity women’s economic empowerment “new normal” pandemic control. in case emerge develop economies, disproportionate impact woman bind worse, give weak social protection exist. our discussion today also reveal exception country afi network, many policy regulatory response pandemic consider gender-specific dynamic economic fallout pandemic, respect may help avoid widen gender gap access finance. how move forward address widen gender gap access finance? the pandemic may unleash unprecedented hardship vulnerable group woman (particularly operate informal msme sectors), opportunity rebuild economies, it, rebuild manner lead inclusion resilience. 5 please permit point, share think could make progress.  promote gender-inclusive finance somehow inextricably link address many underlie socio-economic cultural issue create inequality woman job market business (formal informal). policy need empower woman economically address issue affect work-life balance, employment income disparities, land ownership, inheritance, education, healthcare, child care, elder care, among others. great access finance women., necessarily depend this.  what change require design financial service product (traditional digital) design policy regulation correct additional disparity create recent covid-19 responses? for example, exist literature show woman traditionally tend pay loan time. how pandemic change narrative might implication women’s access credit go forward? how financial institution good support female client help avoid lose access future credit?  how improve quality financial intermediation address gender-inclusive finance barrier cause covid-19 6 pandemic, compromise stability integrity financial systems?  how galvanise need support mobilise necessary resource (technical capacity, peer-to-peer learning, guidance stakeholder dialogue, support) redesign social safety net financial (and digital) literacy programme good align gender-inclusive finance? how effectively engage relevant policymakers, legislators, civil society advocate policy ultimately promote gender-inclusive finance? in sum, gender-inclusive finance agenda critical ever before, coordinate effort require accelerate action go forward. make real progress require bold action address underlie pre-existing vulnerability exacerbate current pandemic., rebuild inclusive, sustainable, resilient future. i trust member afi network, continue support afi, will, go forward, work assiduously remove underlie barrier help address widen gender gap access finance. i invite u renew respective maya, denarau, kigali commitments, make big push tangible progress gender-inclusive

moderators, panelists, participants, contribute diverse way make webinar big success been. let u continue work together bridge gap access finance all. i thank kind attention. appearance ecological transition demographic challenge committee congress deputy margarita delgado deputy governor 10.09.2020 1members parliament, thank much kind invitation. i delight today discus topical issue that, i believe, important context finalise draft climate change energy transition bill. i would like begin reflect role public policy play manage transition. i go talk role bank sector must play process, include business, regulatory supervisory matters. i also address one key outstanding issues: lack reliable uniform information, hamper decision investment, supervision control. the bank sector’s involvement transition sustainable economic model relatively recent development. however, well aware, combat climate change recur objective international institutions, since least unite nation summit hold rio de janeiro 1992. i think fair say european union has, time, spearhead fight internationally. europe decide act without delay, late. nevertheless, need aware take early action increase social cost associate process transform economy. admittedly, transition cost and, reflect law itself, may undesired economic social consequences. however, highlight cost always le would arise scenario envisage materialise. although transition doubt open opportunities, sector group potentially affect series decision identified, measure must implement mitigate net adverse effect transition sustainable economy them. it worth bear mind that, though climate change global affair, term cause consequences, cross-country difference effect rise average temperatures. accord scientific studies, spain one european country potentially affect climate change. in words, among country aggregate impact acute and, further, le adaptability change. that said, spain advantage regard use renewable energy (for instance term average sunlight hours) clear current account balance energy dependence situation would improve substantially achieve full decarbonisation. the draft climate change energy transition bill reflect circumstance difficulties, must set ambitious realistic path, line international european commitment country assumed. naturally, yourselves, member parliament, custodian public's will, legitimacy need set rule mark transformation process, doubtless complex challenging. 2before focus main topic appearance, allow provide brief consideration suitability tool available u reach emission reduction targets. a i already mentioned, bank sector important role play process; however, public policies, notably fiscal policy, must play preeminent role manage transition sustainable economy. from economic theory standpoint, origin problem associate climate change paradigmatic case negative externality need “internalised”, social cost (in case, environmental costs) pollution take account economic agent pursue activity. when face type market failure, taxation use ensure pollution intensity productive activity equate marginal costs, thereby reduce emission socially optimal level. further, mention make eu emission trade system, currently review bring carbon price close level consistent paris agreement. logically, objective achieve ways, promote technological change reduce pollutant emissions. and, indeed, consumer also prominent voice process, change preference favour certain type product also alter relative prices. international coordination policy key. decision them, tax subsidies, take different level (national, regional local), whereas technological aspect agents’ preference far global, cannot disentangle them. naturally, global world, always risk certain jurisdiction apply lax environmental standard european ones. to prevent distortion trade economy, necessary put place adjustment mechanisms, negotiate world trade organisation. return role financial sector, i would like point that, relatively recently, climate risk give limit consideration small number banks, chiefly within social responsibility areas. allow admit that, area consider beyond remit, neither assess central banks. nevertheless, since sign paris agreement 2015, role finance play transition process become visible climb agenda international financial organisations. notable various initiative within framework unite nations, oecd, financial stability board basel committee bank supervision, among others, sustainable finance work european commission. specifically, central bank bank supervision environment, i would mention work network green financial sector (ngfs). this network create late 2017 aim analysing, define promote best practice contribute proper management climate risk financial sector. the banco de españa actively participate work network, grow exponentially around 70 member 13 observers. 3naturally, worth consider bank contribute collective challenge; ultimately, think climate change see pollutant, industrial activities, clearly include banking. the transition law two article directly affect financial sector. however, despite ‘low-emissions’ sector, bank major role play achieve transition. first, clear change productive model affect economic agent also direct consequence banks. therefore, come surprise supervisor require bank appropriately measure risk derive transition process. from theoretical standpoint, ecological transition process entail two type risk: (i) physical risks, cause direct effect climate change result increase temperature frequent severe storms, flood natural disasters, (ii) transition risks, refer potential effect specific borrower regulatory measures, technological changes, change customer behaviour preferences. the two type risk clearly relate interdependent: ambitious regulations, great transition risk low physical risk, vice versa. however, wait long, act could also lead risk high, i.e. abrupt, late corrective action take physical risk already difficult avoid. the measurement risk undoubtedly pose significant challenges. there methodological difficulties, long time horizon effect physical risk observed, far exceed use measure conventional bank risks. measure transition risk also present problems: understand arise straightforward; lack information allow assessment firm could adversely affected; exact consequence different future scenario clear. in event, worth remember that, unlike ‘transitions’ prompt sudden change technology behaviour, transition decarbonise economy announce report on; such, would hard claim surprise lack knowledge. moreover, analyse business environment already essential part risk assessment management bank must carry out, regardless whether origin change technological, relate customer behaviour, regulatory environmental. a series expectation single supervisory mechanism banco de españa itself, within remit supervisory competences, manage measure risk expect publish soon. the implementation measure certainly take time, supervisory expectation short medium term would bank understand implication risk capable identify measure it, always manner proportionate size complexity. the information generate internally reach board 4directors, must capable assess risk impact business model incorporate risk appetite framework. an important consequence i would stress committee that, appropriately measure risks, bank sector would become catalyst change productive model. if bank identify quantify climate risks, pas price capital, become “facilitators” transition channel fund activity contribute sustainable transformation economy. in regard, issue long debate internationally whether regulation contribute accelerate transformation process. indeed, european bank authority mandate assess, 2025, whether differential prudential treatment exposure consider “green” would justified. the banco de españa consider financial regulation cannot take lead process, let alone stand potential inaction actor which, i already mentioned, much appropriate instrument purposes. it note similar effect would ultimately occur measure implement foster transition sufficiently successful bank properly factor impact measure risk analyses. any additional regulatory factor would, minimum, entail “double counting” risk capital, would create perverse incentive reduce framework’s sensitivity risk. give scale structural change, important bank adopt forward-looking approach, take consideration different potential scenarios. the banco de españa, like supervisors, develop methodology ass risk forward-looking manner, translate climate change stress tests. regardless considerations, implications, challenge opportunity transformation process economy present banks’ business obvious. the amount investment need undertake transition indeed enormous (the bill estimate around €200 billion come decade), mention additional resource european plan approve july. undoubtedly, great opportunity modernise transform economy sustainable model, set bill. obviously, mobilisation financial resource clear incentive bank get involved. however, i believe also fair point sector fully commit fight, attest recent climate commitment, sign occasion cop25, launch centre responsible sustainable finance (finresp spanish abbreviation). nevertheless, despite favourable attitude, i would like stress that, continue move forward, must address key challenge: lack sufficiently consistent reliable information. in regard, sir ronald cohen, well-known philanthropist, investor environmental activist, recently draw analogy change account standards. what call “generally accept account principles” (gaap) become widespread 1933, u government mandate company draw annual account accordance common principles. prior 1929 crash, 5each company publish information accord criteria, prevent proper understanding, comparison analysis financial information. indeed, despite limitation interpretive problems, without common account principles, solvency risk-discrimination analysis would lack reliability. similarly, environmental risk cannot assess without comparable information. all economic agents, whether banks, investor customers, need information make decision and, despite undeniable cost company incur adapt comply additional transparency requirements, i believe necessary change. in context, i would like refer briefly development green bond market. the history product begin 2007, first issue european investment bank. a know, green bond fund must earmark finance project directly relate sustainability, preservation natural resource transition low-carbon economy. to receive "green" certification, bond must adhere set principles, like green bond principle (gbp) establish icma1 2014, external assessor must verify compliance. i believe highly significant market evolve outside official initiative base entirely private standards, like gpb, show grow concern among private investor effect climate change. however, private standard also face uniformity consistency problems. the rapid growth market also raise concern possibility that, image corporate social responsibility reasons, certain issuer may attempt appear care environmental issue action would actually imply, could cause future reputational problems.2 pressure mount credit institutions, investor customer increase transparency information, european regulation also advocate resolutely this. in regard, 15 april, european council adopt regulation establish eu-wide classification system, "taxonomy", aim set common language determine economic activity may consider sustainable environmental point view. the commission also consult development european standard green bonds. clearly, need understand taxonomy, may proposed, cannot perfect day one. it fix nature represent additional challenge. ideally, strive dynamic concept taxonomy, take account current emissions, also reflect whether activity increase reduce emissions. in event, clear that, order analyse manage risks, necessary standards, even though may imperfect. 1 international capital market association 2 in jargon field, type behaviour call "greenwashing". 6naturally, draft climate change energy transition bill add trend, require entity security admit trading, credit institutions, insurance reinsurance companies, company (for reason size) publish annual assessment financial impact society climate change risk generate activity, well measure take address risks. the bill stipulate two-year period set report requirement royal decree.3 i believe important enhance report requirement line european developments, ongoing revision non-financial report directive. allow conclude sake brevity. i would like refer internal work banco de españa carry adapt new reality, undoubtedly affect duty regulator, micro- macroprudential supervisor market investor, even monetary policy (whose strategy currently reviewed), would take much time. of course, interested, i happy discus point further. thank attention. i disposal clarification may require. 3the bill provides, however, credit institution publish, 2023, specific decarbonisation target loan investment portfolios, line paris agreement. 1 ‘monetary policy financial market post-covid-19 south africa’ open remark m fundus tshazibana, deputy governor south african reserve bank, jp morgan emerge market credit conference, 22 september 2020 1. introduction lady gentlemen, thank opportunity address edition jp morgan emerge market credit conference – first hold online. in many aspects, 2020 certainly year firsts. in recent years, much concern halt global growth stem concern possibility recession world’s large economy, concern escalation trade tension would result large reduction global trade investment, well concern geopolitical developments. but now, never widespread concern around pandemic would change many aspect daily lives. the covid-19 outbreak major health, social economic impacts, require sizeable adjustment policy. monetary policy, unsurprisingly, also respond once-in-a-100-years event. in comment today, i would like elucidate south african reserve bank (sarb) respond exceptional circumstances. second, i highlight policy outlook see it. finally, i turn challenge ‘post-covid’ world may pose monetary policymaking, role financial market may play inform approach. 2 2. how covid-19 crisis require strong response a covid-19 pandemic start spread asia, europe, south african authority move quickly follow international best practice impose restriction people’s movement economic activities. these measure help ‘flatten curve’ infection allow healthcare sector time make adequate preparations. these measure appear pay dividends. while covid-19 infection rate surge south africa june july, rate new infection appear subsiding. the mortality rate remain moderate global standards, healthcare system largely responsive need. expert agree human cost would high government’s response delayed. however, part world, healthcare gain come significant economic costs. in april 2020, strict lockdown levels, manufacture production retail sale fell 45% 49% respectively compare month earlier. vehicle, accommodation restaurant sale basically grind halt. a statistic south africa since reported, gross domestic product (gdp) second quarter fell unprecedented 51% (annualised). the sarb’s late forecast projection show annual gdp fall 8.2%. this several time bad previous deep annual contraction, -2.1% 1992.1 while number bad news dominate headlines, also important understand gdp data arrive lag, economy since begin recover. a lockdown restriction gradually ease early may, business activity resumed. by july, half april plunge output sale reversed. high-frequency mobility transaction indicator show normalisation continue august, case return pre-crisis levels. globally, many country also see stronger-than-expected rebounds. although recovery path likely difficult one, current data encouraging. 1 the comparison stretch back 1947. 3 part explanation strong rebound fiscal monetary authority provide unprecedented stimulus. condition certainly justify it. let u recall height risk aversion, fourth week march, financial condition unite state (us) six standard deviation restrictive territory; south african rand decline 17% u dollar space five weeks, yield 10-year government bond rise 280 basis point high 11.7%. emergency action world’s fiscal monetary authority help stave financial crisis. in south africa, early gain stabilise inflation well within target range allow sarb join massive stimulus effort. the monetary policy committee low repurchase (repo) rate cumulative 275 basis point march july – one large move emerge market country. our response limit policy rate cuts. to facilitate flow credit cash-constrained business individuals, sarb inject liquidity money market large frequent repo operations; also temporarily low regulatory requirement banks. in response sign illiquidity government bond market, sarb embark programme asset purchases, point i return later. finally, sarb assist national treasury set administer government’s loan guarantee scheme, aim promote bank lend qualify businesses. 3. normalisation process take time a indicate earlier, economic activity indicator rebound recent months. encouragingly, monthly monetary data show credit private sector continue grow year-on-year terms, indicate risk ‘credit crunch’ abated. since peak late march, yield short-dated local-currency bond decline much 400 basis points, long end decline le 200 basis point – consistent steep shape yield curve. nevertheless, full normalisation economic activity likely long-haul effort. 4 favourable base effect likely result strong gdp gain third quarter 2021 whole. thus, sarb’s quarterly projection model (qpm) forecast real gdp gain 3.9% next year. but level terms, model expect real gdp gradually converge back towards pre-covid-19 levels. the qpm therefore point large output gap (as high 6.5% potential gdp average 2020) gradually narrow remainder forecast period remain negative even 2022. because persistence economic slack good anchor inflation expectations, sarb expect consumer price inflation remain within low half 3−6% target range forecast period, exception short-lived spike second quarter next year low base distort energy price inflation. bar materialisation upside risks, benign inflation outlook allow sarb maintain accommodative stance come two years, withdraw stimulus gradual fashion, output gap slowly closes. in september forecast exercise, qpm’s projection consistent rise policy rate current rate 3.5% 4% end 2021 5% year later. the latter would still 70 basis point cpi average past decade. 4 monetary policy challenge post-covid-19 world however, monetary policy committee highlight many time past, qpm policy rate forecast serf guideline, since economic development premise uncertain. indeed, uncertainty may turn high usual post-covid-19 world. a contemplate global domestic economy beyond pandemic, i would like focus several issue affect conduct monetary policy come years. we know crisis affect trend productivity potential economic growth medium term, globally domestic level. be go experience loss growth momentum, occur global financial crisis, due slow reaction business structural 5 change demand? will rise public corporate debt level crowd private investment? or, contrary, change behaviour economic agents’ spur investment new high-tech industry raise productivity sustain basis? few economist will express strong view topic present. however, take view trend growth likely weak strong next cycle, project particular weak contribution capital accumulation.2 and uncertainty i allude play negative role. by increase likelihood large losses, uncertainty discourage business risk capital supply-enhancing projects; pandemic’s memory could result ‘belief scarring’ could durably undermine confidence economy’s ability grow strongly, professor veldkamp recently suggest jackson hole symposium.3 in turn, low potential growth – either globally south africa, – would implication equilibrium, neutral real interest rate (nrir), crucial element medium-term monetary policy calibration. traditional economic theory argue decline potential growth imply decline neutral rate.4 indeed, research past decade suggest advance economy least, low potential growth contribute secular decline neutral rates.5 however, linkage may complex emerge economy south africa, long structural current account deficit hence require equilibrium interest rate attract foreign well domestic save finance investment. the sarb’s model link domestic neutral rate global counterpart south african-specific risk premium. the risk, however, risk premium rise time weak growth increase concern fiscal sustainability, thus offset benefit low global neutral rate. 2 see ‘coronavirus’ global effects: growth driver post-virus world’, global economics view, citi, 8 july 2020. 3 see j kozlowski, l veldkamp v venkateswaran, ‘scarring body mind: long-term belief-scarring effect covid-19’, 2 september 2020. 4 the theory first develop knut wicksell interest price (1898). 5 see instance l rachel t smith, ‘secular driver global real interest rate’, bank england work paper no. 571, december 2015. 6 uncertainty potential gdp growth neutral rate also affect speed central bank normalise policy stance. a indicate earlier, present sarb see slow narrow output gap, allow gradual real rate normalisation. but output gap le negative expect latter year forecast, equilibrium real rate higher, risk high inflation might end under-estimated. at time, uncertainty remain whether low pass-through foreign exchange movement inflation persist come years, especially south africa’s loss investment-grade status result structurally high rand exchange rate volatility. 5. heed message financial market in try ascertain potential structural change long-term macroeconomic variables, sarb will, course, watch sign financial markets. in respect, financial market department continue monitor market developments, detect threat smooth market function also understand market expectation interest rates, inflation credit risk premia, among variables. for instance, sarb pay close attention steepen government bond yield curve, begin onset covid-19 crisis, persist even march risk aversion abated. be steepness yield curve – absolute term relative emerge market peer – simply function credit risk, tell u something future inflation risk too? inflation expectations, survey breakeven rates, case low historically generally well within target range. but want sure concern south africa’s debt trajectory crystallise high inflation expectations. in respect, i would like briefly touch point strongly debate since sarb introduce programme government bond purchase march. should aim programme limit (as now) ensure proper bond market liquidity? or extend influence shape yield curve order limit government fund cost ensure low policy rate fully transmit broad borrow cost economy? the answer question 7 simple, especially yield curve control policy become widespread recently, therefore le disreputable. however, risk consider strategy south africa. first, unlike advance economies, south africa remain far effective low bind interest rates. hence, influence shape yield curve time sarb can, needed, cut rate achieve goal could unnecessarily complicate policymaking policy communication. second, interfere market’s ‘price discovery’ mechanism, sarb would reduce ability learn yield curve’s signal capacity, provide message longer-term inflation expectations. lose signal would also make hard policymakers elsewhere ass fiscal space. third, keep longer-term yield low market ‘equilibrium’ might discourage non-resident investor resume purchase domestic bonds, keep rand undervalue hence add future inflation risks. 6. conclusion in conclusion, let highlight sarb’s response unprecedented crisis contraction economic activity strong quick, large part due early hard-won credibility gain anchor inflation expectations. a result gains, sarb able prevent economic contraction feed credit crunch financial market meltdown. the stabilisation rand’s exchange rate decline government bond yield encourage sign investor see policy action jeopardise credibility. however, contemplate uncertain future respect potential growth variables, allow reiterate familiar important points. monetary policy cannot improve potential growth rate economy reduce macroeconomic risks. these address implement prudent macroeconomic policy structural reform low cost generally increase investment opportunities, potential growth job creation. such step enhance effectiveness monetary policy transmission broad economy. 8 over medium term, sarb need remain data-dependent policy decisions. indeed, stand ready utilise tools, appropriate, within mandate support economy ensure financial market functional. a financial market move towards new post-crisis equilibriums, continue monitor development asset price closely leverage information formulation monetary policy. thank you. for release delivery 12:00 p.m. edt september 21,

statewide regional areas, addition activity within local communities, bank could help address need “credit deserts” capacity so. in consider economic development, anpr consider loan small businesses, small farms, minority-owned small business might consider impactful responsive community needs. in addition, anpr propose elevate focus availability check account save account product serve lmi communities. finally, consider cra’s purpose history relate nation’s current challenges, board seek feedback modification approach would strengthen cra regulation address systemic inequity credit access minority individual communities. meet need lmi individual community it important cra ensure wide range lmi bank need met. we hear stakeholder feedback retail community development activity - 7 - important meet lmi bank needs. accordingly, propose ass large retail bank use separate retail test community development test separate finance service subtests (figure 3). separate assessment retail lending, retail services, community development financing, community development service support robust bank engagement community variety channels. stakeholder feedback highlight area essential lmi communities. the standalone retail lend test important stay true cra’s core focus provide credit underserved communities. retail lend channel family get mortgage buy first house entrepreneur get loan small business. retail service channel lmi household might get access essential service local bank branch, low-cost check account. community development finance capture bank lend investment create maintain affordable housing, promote economic development, revitalize stabilize lmi communities. community development service include financial counsel low-income family important volunteer activity undertake bank staff, serve board local nonprofit. some activity lend primarily qualitative review. for example, anpr highlight essential bank service responsive community needs, customer support provide multiple language flexible branch hour accommodate lmi customers’ work schedules. although conclude value service local community lend easily monetary value metric, anpr propose introduce quantitative benchmark appropriate, indicator whether branch location maintain increase underserved areas. - 8 - address change bank industry the anpr propose modernize cra assessment area recognition reliance mobile internet bank increase 25 year since cra regulation last substantially revised. the anpr still maintain focus branches, give importance individual communities. it also propose tailor facility-based assessment area definition base bank size. for large bank conduct significant amount lend deposit-taking outside facility-based assessment areas, anpr present option determine bank assess outside branch located. define lending-based assessment area one option, preliminary analysis approach provide anpr find banks’ lend outside current assessment area widely disperse often occur place already well served. define deposit-based assessment area another option, would entail additional data report burden, currently data analyze option closely. for internet banks, lend across broad area branch locations, nationwide assessment area may advance cra’s goal effectively current practice assess bank solely headquarter office. provide certainty consistency, minimize burden, tailor expectation provide clarity, consistency, transparency the anpr seek provide great clarity consistency tailor performance evaluations. respond call great certainty regard bank assess rated, anpr introduce metrics-based approach calibrate base 6,000 - 9 - write public cra evaluations.13 separate retail test community development test provide great scope tailor metric local market conditions, often differ retail lend community development financing. this approach would create clear quantitative threshold level retail lend community development finance need achieve “satisfactory” cra rating. for retail lend subtest, would apply large retail bank small bank choose opt in, bank could earn presumption “satisfactory” performance conclusion assessment area reach clear threshold lend lmi borrower neighborhood major product lines. the threshold would tailor local market condition adjust automatically reflect change business cycle. they would base local data reflect credit need opportunity among lmi individuals, communities, small businesses, small farm market data reflect level lmi lend area lenders. federal reserve analysis confirm large difference lmi lend opportunity among assessment areas, illustrate importance tailor retail lend threshold need local community (figure 4). the anpr also consider use metric relative performance range produce recommend retail lend subtest conclusion “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs improve,” “substantial noncompliance.” we encourage commenters make use cra analytics data table publish march order evaluate presumption threshold option performance range provide feedback. 13 federal reserve staff create database base 6,000 write public cra performance evaluation sample 3,700 bank vary asset sizes, business models,

tables,” march 6, 2020, ://.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/data_tables.htm. - 10 - for community development finance subtest, board propose measure large retail bank’s community development loan investment relative deposit assessment area. the threshold community development finance subtest would calibrate use local national data. when look past performance evaluations, find community development finance vary widely across different assessment areas, likely reflect different level community development capacity unique need challenge different communities. for example, san diego, california, total dollar amount banks’ community finance activity relative deposit three time high little rock, arkansas (figure 5). in addition, metropolitan area overall high level community development finance relative deposit rural area overall. for reasons, important tailor community development finance subtest use threshold account difference adjust automatically change time. to provide certainty transparency, retail lend community development finance threshold would make available simple, regularly update dashboard bank could use compare level activity threshold assessment area (figure 6). for example, dashboard retail lend subtest could show threshold large retail bank reach major product line receive presumption “satisfactory,” include percentage loan lmi borrower percentage loan lmi neighborhoods. tailor performance evaluation bank size business model the propose separate subtests would also ensure expectation tailor size business model different banks. it important small bank able remain - 11 - current qualitative approach choose. accordingly, small retail bank could continue evaluate current cra framework, would option retail lend evaluate metrics-based retail lend subtest. small bank could also elect retail service community development activity evaluated. wholesale limit purpose bank would evaluate community development activities. the anpr solicit feedback option additional tailor flexibility institutions, lend evaluation metric would applicable large retail banks. minimize data collection report burden the anpr seek comment strike appropriate balance provide great certainty bank assess increase use metric minimize associate data collection report burden. in effort reduce burden, propose metric would rely great extent possible exist data collection public data sources, approach would exempt small bank deposit certain data collection requirements. large bank currently report community development loan aggregate level. a bank may also share information examiner community development loan investment specific assessment area cra exam. however, bank formally report data activity assessment area, data currently available sources. without report data consistently provide basis comparison, would difficult measure evaluate large bank’s community development performance consistent predictable way. - 12 - clarify expand eligible cra activity focus community the anpr propose update clarify community development activity qualify order provide great certainty bank community counts. the anpr propose publish regularly update illustrative, necessarily exhaustive, list qualify activities. to provide additional certainty, board also seek feedback preapproval process, bank propose community development activity examiner determine whether qualify proceed loan, investment, service activity. this additional certainty could help promote great investment bank retain focus lmi communities. in addition, anpr seek feedback clarify definition qualify activity broaden certain definition target ways. for example, board consider define cra-eligible activity create preserve naturally occur affordable house consider whether broaden set volunteer activity would qualify rural areas. the board also clarify government tribal plan require qualify activity revitalize stabilize communities. this especially important indian country, want encourage bank make impactful investment support tribal government increase certainty activity qualify cra credit. recognize special circumstance small bank rural area stakeholder feedback emphasize small retail bank play vital role many underserved communities, rural areas. accordingly, anpr provide small bank rural area operate portion large county great clarity flexibility - 13 - tailor facility-based assessment area definition. the anpr propose small bank would require expand delineation assessment area include part county physical presence either engage de minimis amount lend substantial competition institutions, except limit circumstances. in addition, anpr propose revise definition community development service include wide range volunteer activity address particular need rural areas. the path ahead it 25 year since last significant revision cra regulation, important get reform right. we provide extend 120-day comment period allow ample time thoughtful feedback broad set stakeholders. the input stakeholder thus far tremendously valuable, appreciate care concern express many comment letter form input important regulation. in week month ahead, look forward review comment analyze option great impact, include change address inequity challenge face minority community individuals. this feedback critically important, ready listen. stakeholder express strong support agency work together modernize cra. by reflect stakeholder view provide long period public comment, anpr intend build foundation bank agency converge consistent

financial situation household a case firms, last global financial crisis, financial situation household improve significantly, mortgage lend standard far prudent. however, consumer lend post high growth rate recent year group vulnerable household continue exist. in case, crisis also significant impact households. it lead reduction wage income individual lose job furloughed, wealth, give adjustment valuation financial assets. thus, social security registrations, strip worker subject furlough schemes, is, series might call “actual registrations”, estimate show year-on-year decline 22% end-april, much sharp reduction service segment hard hit restriction movement associate state alert, hospitality sector. in late july, year-on-year decline actual registration eased, stand 9% low figure observe year earlier. 7from standpoint financial stability, evidence available4 show variable high information content explain probability default household become unemployed fall household income. the evidence show that, result shock trigger coronavirus, consumer credit default expect occur early stage mortgage default households, deterioration income employment adversely affect mortgage lend overall, slight time lag. further, notable disparity financial situation household affect pandemic. accord banco de españa’s spanish survey household finances5, industry bear brunt pandemic employ high proportion young female worker sectors, also high proportion low-wage workers. the low wage partly offset fact employee concern live household member high income. in term household wealth, 28% worker social industry lived, 2017, household whose financial asset amount le one month's income, around 8% bank debt whose repayment amount 40% gross household income. thus, wage income financial position household worker social industry fragile 2017 household whose member employ regular industries. however, case firms, economic policy also play vital role institutional sector mitigate adverse economic effect pandemic. specifically, addition sustain household income furlough schemes, unemployment benefit increased, essential utility guaranteed, assistance provide rental expenses, measure approve support self-employed whose income plummeted. more recently, minimum live income scheme design currently implemented. in addition, number specific measure negotiate ensure household financial difficulty fail meet financial obligations. these include legislative bank sector moratorium individuals’ mortgage loans, allow individual meet certain requirement delay loan repayment period range three month one year. a total 1.3 million moratorium grant date, represent outstanding credit balance nearly €45 billion (almost 7% total volume portfolio). the moratorium grant concentrate region affect crisis, individual age 30 55, self-employed persons, loan arrange easy credit conditions. also noteworthy fact moratorium common bank high credit growth year immediately precede outbreak pandemic. look ahead, trend employment distribution among household crucial come quarters, regard materialisation financial stability risk pose sector. the ultimate impact also depend effectiveness continuity measure place sustain household income. 4 see banco de españa (spring 2020), financial stability report, box 1.2, “build-up household debt defaults”. 5 see p. alvargonzález, m. pidkuyko e. villanueva (2020), “the financial position worker affect pandemic: analysis draw spanish survey household finances”, analytical article, economic bulletin, banco de

2008, reduce weight relative gdp 12% global financial crisis level close 5% 2019, line european countries, sector’s start point unquestionably le vulnerable. moreover, reduction house investment activity come parallel decline house price which, despite growth observe recent years, end-2019 remain (in real terms) 29% average nationwide level observe 2007. however, cross-regional variation indicator overvaluation house price show value close equilibrium.6 it also bear mind weight mortgage lend highly leverage transaction much low post-2008 period, mortgage loan survive global financial crisis credit condition generally consider prudent, close reach maturity. all development good position sector withstand current crisis. in event, sector inevitably also reflect impact health crisis. even shock, house market enter phase gradual slowdown, term activity transaction prices, mark expansion prior years, adverse effect financial crisis overcome. this outlook profoundly affect declaration state alert due covid-19, 6 see ://.bde.es/f/webbde/gap/secciones/salaprensa/notasinformativas/20/presbe2020_49en.. 9particularly sharp slump transaction second half march april. in subsequent months, gradual, albeit partial, recovery estimate take place, restriction movement lift house purchase process gradually begin operate normal. in effect, lockdown make much difficult conduct process buy sell home. once state alert declared, number sale public deed plummet record low april, fall approximately 70% year-on-year. in subsequent month situation improved, although fall 20% (compared previous year) still post june. in setting, house price estimate remain gradually slow path date back end 2018, although accord late available data, correspond june, still post positive

previous crisis. indicator trend appear anticipate upturn house investment q3, although expect remain pre-pandemic level, owe worsen outlook households. over long horizon, extent house market eventually recover health crisis behind u depend degree persistence adverse economic financial effects. 10the impact financial sector the bank sector the crisis trigger pandemic clearly accentuate credit, market operational risk face bank sector. the improvement quality spanish bank sector’s balance sheet solvency level last ten year also clearly put good position absorb crisis continue provide finance need economy. the risk sector’s financial stability mitigate various economic policy measure adopted. indeed, development credit, i mention earlier, differentiate crisis episode past. at aggregate level, volume new lend outstanding balance deposit institutions’ loan real economy increased. this represent notable change trend compare development bank lend spain since last financial crisis. on data 30 july 2020, total bank credit non-financial corporation household grow year-on-year rate 2.4%, compare decline 0.3% record february 2020. this change trend largely attributable credit non-financial corporation which, i say earlier, quicken substantially follow outbreak pandemic. most finance obtain firm use shore liquidity buff meet future borrow needs. in fact, growth rate firms’ bank deposit increase slightly 4% february 13% june. by contrast, lend household fell rate 1.8% june, whereas virtually flat february. credit house purchase post year-on-year fall 2.7%, decline almost 1 pp february. the year-on-year growth rate consumer credit, stand 15% february, fell low 2.5% may. in june grow 2.3%, owe especially drawdowns credit facilities, since new lend continue move downward path. however, come month inevitably witness deterioration credit quality banks’ balance sheets, result sharp contraction income non-financial corporation household recent months. indeed, deterioration expect intensify moratorium end grace period guarantee loan expires. the volume npls private non-financial sector continue fall year-on-year rate 11% june, although 8 pp le decline february. the npls banks’ business spain increase 2% march june year, major difference firm households. although increase npls traditionally lag behind onset recessions, increase contain consider scale fall gdp. undoubtedly, measure implemented, particularly guarantee scheme firm payment holiday individuals, significantly reduce immediate rise newly classify npls. reclassification npls recent year significantly reduce npl ratio, also fallen, owe le activity impair asset market. look ahead, uncertainty potential rise npl ratio notable since crisis unprecedented scale deep envisage adverse macroeconomic scenario apply stress test financial system recent 11years. the time also different since episode, current macroeconomic forecast confirmed, adjustment gdp would concentrate first year shock (2020), follow recovery whose strength still uncertain. in addition, impact hinge size duration measure adopted, influence effectiveness. in event, increase npls expect high among small firm operate sector involve great social interaction; and, case households, exposure secure mortgages. accordingly, bank already record early part provision might set aside future. furthermore, previous remark aggregate situation system mask considerable diversity. this mainly start position various institutions, term fund credit quality, already different. likewise, segment household non-financial corporation also still highly fragile financial situations. for example, small firm vulnerable scenario fall revenues. but, additionally, crisis like this, i mention earlier, deterioration banks’ solvency expect hinge degree exposure various region sector affect differently pandemic. in event, case household non-financial corporations, public support measure implement recent month help mitigate effect financial stability. in particular, government loan guarantee scheme various measure adopt ecb contribute smooth impact banks’ solvency. the restriction payment dividend bank also contribute significantly objective. and, lastly moratorium useful classification loan non-performing ease distribute time. nevertheless, impact covid-19 crisis financial institutions’ profitability already clear. the bank industry’s already narrow profit margin recent year – profitability actually stand cost capital main european bank system – squeeze even outbreak covid-19 need record high provision cover adverse development banking. specifically, data first half 2020 show list spanish bank consolidate net loss €10.5 billion, compare profit similar order magnitude period 2019. high provision and, especially, non-recurring adjustment goodwill, result expect downturn economic condition account pandemic, main cause low profits. the loss concentrate two bank large international presence profit decrease two third banks. in event, banks’ recur business affect modestly date offset partly adjustment operate expense and, consequently, continue gain efficiency. 12 therefore, price-to-book (p/b) ratio — compare list banks’ market capitalisation book value — contract notably spain, european countries, decline level around 0.4, although subsequently recover somewhat. 13 one way illustrate risk financial stability pose current episode simulation exercise ass prospectively banks’ resilience adverse macroeconomic scenarios. accordingly, ecb conduct so-called “vulnerability” analysis – underline limitation compare usual stress test – order measure european banks’ resilience strain trigger coronavirus. the result publish last july show risk identified.7 specifically, base results, euro area bank sector overall position withstand pandemic-induced stress, although reduction banks’ solvency adverse macroeconomic scenario would significant. furthermore, result exercise show significant heterogeneity across banks. in particular, accord ecb’s estimations, central scenario8 deplete banks’ capital (cet1) ratio approximately 1.9 pp 12.6% severe scenario 5.7 pp 8.8% 2022. impair credit exposure market risk loss key driver capital consumption. in event, view uncertainty complex nature crisis, despite wide range measure already implemented, need develop certain measure address new one avoid potential financial instability cannot rule out. a i already say previous occasions,9 i think share aim prevent current crisis accompany widespread tighten finance condition seriously damage financial system. therefore authority must remain vigilant head risk financial stability stem crisis must ready provide forceful, pan-european response materialise. look ahead, low profitability bank one main challenge face bank sector europe spain. everything point low even negative interest rate scenario continue even long and, environment, bank may find increasingly difficult obtain return without incur excessive risk. additionally, also face competition potential competitor credit market. these company – necessarily financial origin – extensively harness information customer use new technologies, may drastically alter operate environment traditional banks. the banks’ strategy face challenge must inevitably involve invest heavily type technology make data. this, also, enable refocus lend business higher-margin segment maintain risk assume within reasonable limits. they also continue strive make efficiency 7 “euro area bank sector resilient stress cause

room consolidation sector contribute make bank system, whole, resilient. non-bank financial sector apart effect bank sector, crisis also considerable impact valuation many financial assets,

decline. in fact, unite state euro area, market valuation measures, p/e ratios, return historical highs, potentially indicate certain disconnect recent rapid significant recovery financial market moderate behaviour macroeconomic data concern corporate sector weakness. in respect, despite slowdown recent month rate credit rat downgrades, follow sharp increase march may, spread high-yield corporate debt (i.e. rat bbb) cease rise june europe unite states, thus, contrast investment-grade corporate debt (bbb high rating), remain pre-crisis levels. this deterioration corporate credit quality element vulnerability financial stability. past experience show extensive rat downgrade corporate sector generate adverse second-round effect exacerbate crisis. the mechanism follows: since investment pension funds, along institutional holder corporate debt instruments, usually restriction mandate hold 15non-investment-grade assets, many security become high-yield sell investors, lead decline value thus great loss holders. the importance vulnerability illustrate recent analysis conduct esrb.10 specifically, estimate that, europe, almost half corporate bond bbb rat hold investment funds, around third insurance companies, almost quarter credit institution rest pension funds. investment fund insurance company thus precisely institutional investor hold bbb-rated corporate debt, third associate sector consider sensitive covid-19. a large-scale downgrade debt, investment-grade status, would entail considerable potential loss financial system european union (eu) whole, significant part would correspond indirect loss attributable force sell mention above. the role rat agency process fundamental. when make assessments, institution need take account long-term outlook corporation concern avoid excessively pro-cyclical behaviour. indeed, time round, rat agency appear cautious global financial crisis and, date, phenomenon comparable see past occurred. in event, result exercise serve show systemic importance vulnerability need prepare provide sufficient, internationally coordinate response, depend pandemic develop international level. the impact general government 10 a system-wide scenario analysis large-scale corporate bond downgrades, esrb technical note, 23 july 2020. 16 during current crisis, activation automatic fiscal stabiliser associate low tax receipt increase cyclical expenditure (for instance, unemployment benefit), along effect discretionary measure adopt authority mitigate impact crisis, lead significant increase budget deficit public debt countries. initially, also tension european public debt markets, lead sharp rise sovereign spreads. however, decision ecb reiteration govern council commitment everything necessary support citizen euro area extremely challenge time, ensure monetary policy transmit part economy every country, alleviate tensions. likewise, response european union, resolve make significant public fund available member state mitigate impact crisis reactivate economies, also crucial. in case spain, pandemic strike economy time general government account still display certain element vulnerability. in particular, despite uninterrupted robust growth recent years, end 2019 public sector structural deficit stand 3% gdp public debt ratio 95% gdp. moreover, accord banco de españa projections, next year budget deficit may exceed 10%, public debt-to-gdp ratio may stand around 120%. follow initial increase, ecb european monetary policy decision keep risk premium well contain recent months. however, look ahead, persistently high level public debt would reduce scope countercyclical fiscal measure response adverse macroeconomic shock might even limit economy’s growth capacity; case, would expose spanish economy situation chronic vulnerability change investor sentiment financial markets. for reasons, although response health crisis accompany short term decisive fiscal measure reduce impact, overall growth strategy medium-term horizon need implemented. this include design fiscal consolidation programme, apply bad effect crisis recovery firmed. conclusion the covid-19 pandemic unprecedented negative macroeconomic impact has, turn, lead increase financial stability risks. the action national supranational economic authority (fiscal, monetary supervisory) reduce risks, completely eliminated. we currently experience gradual recovery is, however, subject high degree uncertainty remain incomplete uneven. the economic policy response need adapt specific requirement new

relationship two country commitment european integration. i find essential ecb constantly engage two-way communication, especially citizens’ representatives. we need make sure ecb’s voice hear people people’s voice hear ecb. this event like today’s important me. our regular interlocutor european parliament, accountable treaty monetary policy tasks. transnational set like one give u chance look past nation-specific concern discus europe’s future. the coronavirus (covid-19) pandemic crisis unprecedented magnitude. many recognise famous word jean monnet, one found father european project, said: “europe forge crisis sum solution adopt crises”[1]. this pandemic prove right more. undoubtedly, europe strengthen crisis. but europe opportunity show sum solution adopt crisis. once again, monnet’s word offer inspiration: “europe step towards form organisation world tomorrow”.[2]with word mind, must seize invaluable opportunity strengthen union. we must shape recovery crisis way economy fit world tomorrow. the unique strength european projectthe pandemic measure contain spread virus cause contraction euro area economic activity unprecedented peacetime.[3]while incoming data suggest see strong rebound third quarter[4], strength recovery remain uncertain, well uneven incomplete. it continue highly dependent future evolution pandemic success containment policies. one major reason expect rebound activity second half year because, face large economic shock since second world war, europe leader show unique strength european project: act together, achieve more.the ecb play part collective effort face unprecedented crisis. the nature pandemic shock call extraordinary monetary policy response. we launch pandemic emergency purchase programme (pepp) help stabilise financial market ease monetary policy stance considerably. the pepp temporary, target proportionate. it address specific shock hand, aim repair economic damage result downward pressure inflation work pandemic. in addition, also vital limit risk credit crunch. so substantially ease condition bank obtain liquidity target longer-term refinance operations. bank borrow ecb interest rate reach -1%, condition lend real economy. six month introduce measures, policy package stabilise markets, protect supply credit support recovery. this, turn, support return inflation towards medium-term objective safeguard price stability. at time, uncertainty current environment require careful assessment incoming information, include development exchange rate, regard implication medium-term inflation outlook. the govern council continue stand ready adjust instruments, appropriate, ensure inflation move towards aim sustain manner, line commitment symmetry.when look past six months, ecb game town. our measure complement forceful fiscal response national european levels. this critically important factor alleviate impact pandemic labour market banks’ lending. we judge economy still need support recovery

first time, common budgetary instrument european level use complement fiscal stabiliser national level, even currently temporary. a result, aggregate policy mix fiscal monetary policy reinforce support recovery, thus underpin medium-term price stability. the case jointly shape europe’s futurewe must carry positive momentum forwards. it time europe move beyond initial priority contain

geopolitical tension transform geography value chains, make full use size diversity european economy.if strengthen economic monetary union deepen single market, benefit european improve way produce, distribute consume. we also increase autonomy ensure europe good protect world tomorrow. a legislators, crucial role play design policy revitalise economies. digitalisation case point. we need fully reap potential gain digital technology and, time, make sure labour market remain inclusive. if don’t, risk create new divide, already see gap open look difference wages, education level gender.[5]by implement right set national european policies, achieve together alone. at national level, need make necessary change labour, product financial market regulations, invest education reduce digital exclusion. at european level, complement accelerate progress towards digital single market help deliver economy scale digital firms, address key concern around cybersecurity data protection. in digital economy, also need ensure strength autonomy european payment systems.[6]the eurosystem actively pursue initiative achieve this. we also explore benefits, risk operational challenge introduce digital euro. a digital euro could complement to, substitute for, cash; could provide alternative private digital currency ensure sovereign money remain core european payment systems.the pandemic also clearly refocus people’s attention environment.[7]we cannot miss opportunity reduce prevent climate risk finance necessary green transition. all available evidence show climate-related risk real major consequence economy. a disorderly transition low-carbon economy could pose systemically relevant risks.[8]given interconnect financial sector is, need address risk together.the transition

(via webcast) economic progress report: uneven recovery introduction thank kind introduction. i please connect virtually discus interest rate decision yesterday challenge face canada current economic recovery. tomorrow mark six month since covid-19 declare global pandemic. since then, disease take huge toll life livelihoods. in first half 2020, cause big global downturn since great depression. in canada, economy saw sharp drop record second quarter. gross domestic product fell 13 percent first half year. at low point april, 3 million canadian work, million work reduce hours. this recession exceptionally severe. it also unusual unevenly affect business people. business closure job loss le severe sector could quickly adapt remote work online transactions. in contrast, sector require close contact—and people work them—have hit hardest. these mostly service industries, whose workers—often women, youth low-wage earners—have bear brunt impact. a canada’s central bank, set monetary policy help create condition broad-based growth opportunity. our mandate maximize economic well-being canadians. very uneven recession tend long large impact labour market. so, uneven outcome lead poor outcome all. thus, even monetary policy cannot target specific sectors, important u understand uneven impact recession make policy decision support lasting, broad-based growth. - 2 - today i’m go talk about: ▪ uneven impact covid-19 different sector people; ▪ role policy play boost growth benefit widely shared; ▪ govern council’s decision yesterday keep policy interest rate unchanged maintain quantitative ease program. afterwards, i’d happy take question exchange views. a uneven contraction reopen in july monetary policy report, saw recession recovery play three phases: containment, reopen recuperation. we expect strong growth reopen would give way slow bumpy recuperation. a result, economy would take long time get back end 2019, pandemic. data release since july suggest bounce-back little strong anticipated. by august, almost 2 million job recouped—that’s roughly two-thirds job loss march april. this encouraging. but pandemic put u deep hole, still long climb ahead. for sectors, hole deeper, climb back take longer. field remote work possible generally experience widespread job losses. and essential workers—hospital staff, first responder grocery store employees—had keep work despite pandemic. we grateful them. but worker several service industries—such restaurants, retail travel—saw devastate job loss containment phase (chart 1), sector recover slowly. many business

therefore, besides ensure availability cash, also need consider new way improve efficiency retail payment leverage digital technology extensively. all could signal need broaden approach explore new

play? should central bank focus secure sound regulation offer appropriate safeguard leave private sector come viable alternatives? or ensure provision safe asset issue cbdc? a see, face case practical use, even one apparently simple this, embrace opportunity new technology offer always crystal clear. what’s more, approach topic detail, many question far-reaching implication arise, thus suggest need

leader osaka (via webcast) bank japan september 23, 2020 kuroda haruhiko governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great pleasure opportunity today exchange view distinguish gather business leader kansai region, take place online year due continue impact novel coronavirus (covid-19). i would like take chance express sincere gratitude cooperation various activity bank japan's branch osaka, kobe, kyoto. at outset, i would like talk bank's view economic development home abroad affect covid-19 explain think behind recent conduct monetary policy. i. economic development home abroad let start talk economic development home abroad. in response global spread covid-19 turn year, many country region conduct strict public health measure since early spring, restriction go outside suspension business production activities. a result, global economy become depress significantly first half year (chart 1). the international monetary fund (imf) project global economic growth rate 2020 minus 4.9 percent, exceed negative figure register time global financial crisis. the spread covid-19 yet subside globally, global economy remain severe situation. that said, many country region resume economic activity gradually contain spread, global economy start pick state significant depression. the global pmi pick bottom hit april recently 50, borderline improvement deterioration business condition perceive firms. the imf forecast global economy recover second half 2020 growth rate positive 2021. however, assume pace recovery moderate preventive measure covid-19 continue taken. japan's economy show similar development global economy. specifically, economy seem start pick economic activity resume gradually, although remain severe situation (chart 2). due impact 2 covid-19, real gdp growth rate april-june quarter register significant negative growth, mainly reflect decline private consumption exports, downward pressure put employment income situation well. a wide range industry affect covid-19; particular, eating, drinking, accommodations, well service individual face significant decline demand. that said, state emergency lifted, economic activity resume gradually. a private consumption, face-to-face service remain low level, good consumption sale household electrical appliance pick up, mainly back business reopen income support measures. exports, reflect resumption economic activity abroad, turn pick-up, albeit low level. while extremely high uncertainties, bank project baseline scenario that, impact covid-19 wanes, economy follow improve trend. however, pace improvement expect moderate precautionary effort make voluntarily firm household continue act force constrain economic activity vigilance covid-19 maintained. let move price development japan (chart 3). the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) likely negative time being, mainly affect covid-19, past decline crude oil prices, discount accommodation fee "go to travel" campaign. that said, least now, firms' price cut aim stimulate demand seem observe widely. the share price-increasing item minus share price-decreasing item continue net "increase." under circumstances, bank project baseline scenario that, along economic improvement, year-on-year rate change cpi turn positive increase gradually. however, aforementioned outlook economic activity price extremely unclear, risk skew downside. above all, consequence covid-19 impact domestic overseas economy entail extremely high uncertainties. in addition, attention pay whether covid-19 shock lead decline firms' households' growth expectations, thereby make spend attitude become cautious. thus far, growth expectation seem decline significantly, see firms' 3 stance continue undertake much necessary investment growth area positive change use information communication technology (ict). that said, necessary closely monitor future developments. ii. the bank's conduct monetary policy covid-19 large impact domestic overseas economy also financial side. with investors' risk sentiment deteriorate globally late february, financial market rapidly become unstable. firms' financial position weaken worldwide, reflect decline sale due significant depression global economy. government central bank around world respond swiftly large scale economic financial shock bring covid-19. among efforts, central banks' response two thing common. one support financing, mainly firms, funds-supplying measure support lend well purchase cp corporate bonds, ensure stability financial market large-scale provision liquidity, mainly conduct asset purchases. in regard, bank enhance monetary ease since march implement follow three measure (chart 4). first, bank introduce special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19) order support financing, mainly firms. the total size program 130 trillion yen. specifically, program consist (1) purchase cp corporate bond upper limit 20 trillion yen (2) special funds-supplying operation facilitate finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19), 110 trillion yen maximum. through special operation, bank provide fund favorable term financial institution make loan response covid-19. second, ensure stability financial markets, bank provide ample yen foreign currency funds. a yen funds, yield curve control, bank decide purchase necessary amount japanese government bond (jgbs) without set upper limit view stabilize yield curve low level. regard foreign 4 currency funds, bank provide ample u.s. dollar fund strengthen u.s. dollar funds-supplying operations. third, view low risk premia asset markets, bank actively purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits), thereby prevent firms' households' sentiment deteriorating, mainly volatility asset markets, support positive economic activity. these measure positive effects. although financial market still nervous due vigilance covid-19, tension ease recently. corporate finance continue stress, environment external fund remain accommodative (chart 5). fund cost low levels, year-on-year rate increase amount outstanding bank lend aggregate amount outstanding cp corporate bond remain high. this big difference time global financial crisis; is, downward pressure financial side real economy intensify global financial crisis, whereas current crisis, stability financial system maintain whole, environment external fund remain accommodative, also support policy effects. it expect stability financial system hamper significantly economy continue support financial side. that said, financial system could affect challenge economic entity shift liquidity problem solvency one. thus, future development warrant close attention. a government central bank around world, japanese government bank make swift response current crisis large scale. specifically, government conduct economic measure project size 234 trillion yen, significantly exceed scale measure take global financial crisis. in order address emergency situation current one, cooperation government central bank effective term policy conduct. let elaborate two points. 5 the first support financing, mainly firms, time crisis. in regard, globally share understand central bank provide liquidity government provide solvency support. this time japan, line understanding, government provide credit guarantee loan make private financial institution small medium-sized firm bank provide fund favorable term institution special funds-supplying operation facilitate finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19). this system work well. the second point relation fiscal monetary policies. reflect unprecedented large-scale economic measure conduct japanese government address covid-19, issuance jgbs increased. meanwhile, bank maintain interest rate low level actively purchase jgbs. these active purchase base need conduct monetary policy, recently, give impact covid-19, aim purchase maintain stability bond market. through this, bank also intend support economy fulfill role achieve price stability. in manner, policy mix fiscal monetary policy achieve effectively government bank fulfill respective roles. thus far, i explain bank's monetary policy response current crisis. the bank continue provide support financing, mainly firms, maintain stability financial market take account development regional economy. before end speech, i would like touch challenge monetary policy conduct somewhat long-term perspective. compare period prior global financial crisis, high probability policy interest rate advance economy fall low bind amid situation decline trend natural rate interest. against background, economy face common challenge enhance effectiveness credibility monetary policy. a result review framework monetary policy, federal reserve announce last month would seek achieve inflation average 2 percent time. the federal reserve also make clear would aim achieve inflation moderately 6 2 percent time follow period inflation run persistently 2 percent. the bank take various action overcome challenges. in september 2016, particular, adopt framework "quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control." one component "inflation-overshooting commitment" bank commit expand monetary base year-on-year rate increase observe cpi exceed price stability target 2 percent stay target stable manner. under framework, aim attain situation inflation rate 2 percent average business cycle. thus, bank view federal reserve's think underlie late decision consistent bank monetary policy conduct date. the bank recognize remain necessary maintain highly accommodative financial conditions, aim achieve price stability target well respond covid-19. in particular, since economic financial impact covid-19 highly uncertain, bank, time being, closely monitor impact hesitate take additional ease measure necessary. thank much attention. september 23, 2020kurodaharuhikogovernor bank japanjapan's economy monetary policyspeech meet business leader osaka(via webcast)introductioni.economic

economics feature prominently work. but something else strike hendrik jan schoo. and i quote marc chavannes’s description him: “schoo self-made man, everyday background. reluctantly absorb elite, remain overtly concern risk ordinary people face.” that last sentence resonate me, i realise also fit job description. “managing risk ordinary people face.” or, precise: manage financial risk ordinary people face, control themselves. because make mistake. what central bank directly affect life everyone else around you. they ensure price remain stable. that banks, insurers, pension fund financial

household businesses. and thank robust capital buffers, bank room continue lending. this show important build buff good times. yes, de nederlandsche bank sing old tune again. i sure recognise it. but, one predecessor said: old tune often best. our economy's strong foundation mean also ultimately recover crisis. but i honestly concern europe. the european economy expect contract sharply year. the ability recover blow certainly equal european countries. i particularly concern southern member states. not hit coronavirus. but also countries’ economy already struggle decade. what see recent month debate quickly turn future euro. that bad news europe. all raise important questions. question i would like address together evening. why economic shock waves, bank crisis 2008 coronavirus crisis, constantly throw european cooperation balance? and make europe resistant type shocks, view crisis, eye future? fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 3 lady gentlemen, i highlight tendency europe towards economic divergence north south. i show still benefit greatly european cooperation. but also something correct imbalance preserve advantages. i argue something, find common response common challenges, enhance coordination economic policy north south. that mean straightforward, indispensable smoothly function monetary union strong europe, interest sustainable prosperity ordinary dutch people. in words, emerge crisis strong together. the challenge face u i’d like start say something economic advantage europe give us, continue give us. [figure 1] figure 1: emigration. wave depart family member boat leaf port. i think recognise sort archive photo. an ocean liner. people quayside, wave family friends, sometimes flap handkerchief. the archetypal image post-war emigration. in period 1945-1967 around half million dutch people leave shore country canada, america, australia new zealand, search good life. they ones. in year follow second world war several million european leave continent. and good reason. in 1947 outlook europe sombre. the continent financially devastated, everything short supply, reconstruction effort slow develop. the outbreak cold war paralyse european politics. europe perhaps close become fail continent. but fortunately, history take different course. europe focus emerge ruin two world war decade bitter division become one free prosperous place earth. we become use this, sometimes forget astonish feat was. and astonish european feat, lady gentlemen, small part thank european cooperation. take european single market, whole body rule facilitate free movement people, goods, service capital. there considerable research benefit single market. two conclusion invariably emerge studies: first member state benefit internal market, second small, open economies, netherlands, benefit most. that see graph. [figure 2] fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 4 figure 2: estimate benefit single market, eur per household take together, study show membership single market benefit household netherlands 6,000 10,000 euro every year. even take account dutch contribution eu budget, still substantial welfare gain netherlands. in words, netherlands european single market thank big piece pie. but may ask: euro, common currency? how balance out? a know, creation euro primarily political project. discussion economic monetary union gain momentum fall berlin wall. germany become unify nation. the european partners, principally french, keen ensure reunify germany stay embed unite europe. that deal mitterrand make kohl: unification you; euro us. a well political reasons, also strong economic argument favour common currency. a single market like european market, intensive trade countries, benefit fix exchange rates. this reduce uncertainty surround foreign investments, make easy compare price states. and turn, promote competition trade. the success single market therefore build bedrock euro. but single currency also unfortunately bring disadvantages. certainly group country differ quite bite economically. for example, one common currency mean one common rate interest, rate always suit country. this contribute build-up debt, rocket house prices. irreversibly fix exchange rate offer stability, also imply country long use exchange rate way restore competitiveness. partly this, euro area country benefit equally euro. to put bluntly: country strong economies, netherlands, benefit country weak economies. so common currency work favour strong economies? allow explain. to so, i use netherlands italy examples. exchange rate euro country frozen, were, euro introduce 1999. since then, productivity growth high netherlands italy. this economist refer talk 'stronger' 'weaker' economies. productivity growth mean make good product mean production thus offer good value term price quality. in order keep italian product competitive dutch products, italian currency would depreciate fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 5 currency. a result, italian product would become cheaper. before guilder lira become irreversibly linked, regularly saw kind depreciation lira. but course long possible now. you see well graph, show exchange rate guilder italian lira.[figure 3] figure 3: historical exchange rate dutch guilder italian lira. at begin 70 need nearly 6 guilder buy 1,000 lire, 1999 could get 1,000 lira 1 guilder. a long italian productivity growth lag behind dutch growth, alternative italian wage also lag behind dutch wages. but wage growth already modest. that would imply virtually room leave wage growth italy. and in-built tendency resort wage moderation every recession, italian wage even need reduce time time. wage cut words. economist good come sort pure, conceptual solutions. but remember week protest early 1980s, first lubber cabinet cut public sector pay? when trash pile high street? cut monthly income simply cause practical problems, apply much italian dutch. thank euro, netherlands enjoy strong competitive position still currency. compare southern europe, also compare rest world, thank weak euro exchange rate. and boost exports. it netherlands obtain enormous trade surplus: export much import. this generate high operate profit business also increase tax revenue dutch state. you could say euro always give little boost dutch economy, also dutch treasury. for country like italy, productivity growth lower, roughly opposite applies. at risk oversimplification: absence exchange rate euro area country benefit strong economies, relative burden weak economies. that strong weak economy tendency diverge. if imbalance persist long, lead problem like saw 2011 european debt crisis, several southern euro area country experience major financial problems. well, might say: “tough luck, that's is.” do agree maastricht treaty country euro area look finances? the famous bail-out clause. if simple. of course, country still responsible economy public finances. but 2011 learn painful lesson cannot fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 6 abandon struggle euro area country fate. this would unleash financial force could bring disintegration euro. the economic political havoc would arise literally incalculable. you would know would unravel. so something would definitely want happen. a long phenomenon divergent growth exists, strong economy occasionally step help weak ones. but would much good tackle root cause growth divergence. these difference north south god-given natural phenomenon. you might wondering: southern member state carry reform make economy productive germany netherlands? yes, well, ultimately happen. and also uncomfortable fact recent year many opportunity missed. not term reform economy, also term put public finance order clean bank balance sheets. build buff good times, fix roof sun shining. yes, still old tune. yet people north keep grumble point. but know, italian nice expression that: se mia nonna avesse le ruote, sarebbe una carriola. if grandmother wheel she'd wheelbarrow. but new crisis contend with, coronavirus crisis. and particularly cruel crisis—and i might add hazardous europe—is precisely country euro area vulnerable economy also hit hard virus. that course nothing euro. but mean country hit hard yet again. like netherlands, they, too, intervene decisively mitigate effect coronavirus citizen businesses. consequently, government debt rise further. and financially strong position begin with. a result, risk government country already start introduce austerity measure economy able recover. that would first instance exacerbate economic downturn. take country like greece. at end 2019, greece's public debt already 175% gdp. greece red bar way leave chart. [figure 4] figure 4: wide divergence public debt euro area country greece able support economy way netherlands. just comparison: 175% amount three time dutch public debt. so nothing, see divergence euro area countries. and risk recur euro area crises. but something else also worry respect. and wan fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 7 public support euro result growth divergence. public support euro among euro area citizen remain high. that good news. but take grant stay way? southern europe reap relatively little benefit euro. and northern europe, people often feel call bail mediterranean partner time again. structural transfer wealth generally spoil atmosphere. not providers—but uncomfortable feel inferiority quickly arise among receivers. you even observe country wealth transfer regions. take belgium italy example. if also doubt work ethic italians, country average worker work almost 300 hour per year netherlands, imagine benefit relations. [figure 5] figure 5: cover elsevier magazine i would like stay subject public support, another potentially dangerous trend i detect northern europe. and lag public support free trade general. there instance grow group european believe globalisation good country whole, personally. we see similar development country. for example, one five dutch people think globalisation offer disadvantage advantages. people low income particular feel receive end disadvantages. unfortunately, truth that. dutch business benefit greatly free trade, single market euro. for dutch households, apply less extent. in recent decades, household disposable income growth keep pace growth economy whole. just take look graph.

well, large extent share national income worker receive (the labour share income) steadily declining, share go provider capital increased. incidentally, typically dutch phenomenon. we also observe trend western economies. the fact worker netherlands get small small piece economic pie also due globalisation technological progress. but something else go netherlands. and flexibilisation labour market, go far. that something side agree on. the often vulnerable position flex worker already cause concern social perspective. but top that—and i return argument europe—it also contribute fact work people get increasingly small piece economic pie. and large proportion start see “europe” first foremost private party businessmen, scant benefit pockets, undermine support european project. good. to sum i say far. the euro pillar single market, bring u considerable prosperity. however, euro also tend lead diverge economic growth within europe. the current coronavirus crisis exacerbate phenomenon. if nothing, run risk end new euro area crisis, public support european integration could come pressure. in weak economy southern europe, reap enough benefits. and strong economy netherlands, due uneven distribution benefits, willingness help southern european states. i think netherlands worry about. not base clear economic self-interests, also europe much financial benefits. we see balance power world stage shifting. one superpower retreat confusion, new superpower emerge. unfortunately, always country share value do. for many refugees, europe beacon freedom, peace prosperity prepare risk lives. a sign strength, time challenge european society. and still climate crisis. if want realise ambition limit global warm le 2 degree celsius, complete transition climate-neutral economy fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 9 around 2050. substantial investment require achieve that. investment get grind much easily increase price emit carbon greenhouse gases. in short, go make sure emerge economic crisis sustainable way? the shift balance power, refugee crisis, climate crisis. you europhile know tackle transnational challenge good european level national level. these challenge call european cooperation within strong european union. and inextricably link strengthen foundation currency union. this perfectly possible. the imperfection economic monetary union i outline early like coronavirus, hit u nowhere. we create ourselves. and mean also fix ourselves, want to. but three thing need happen. the first fight coronavirus crisis collectively effectively. european head state excellent job summer create next generation recovery fund. the second country currency union good coordinate fiscal policies, level public debt play central role. and third also need good coordinate area economic policy. now let take i envisage this. emerge strong crisis: agenda this summer, european leader waste time set european recovery fund. their decision important step fight coronavirus crisis. during public debate, comparison make marshall plan, u aid programme help rebuild post-war europe. i think apt comparison. the element make marshall plan success reflect plan european recovery. the recovery fund emergency aid intend support public investment country strengthen economic growth potential. the receive country retain important degree responsibility money spent, within certain set conditions. the finance structure way ensure southern european country accumulate ever debt. and fund big enough really make difference. it also good priority give investment digitisation make economy climate-neutral. that way kill two bird one stone: narrow gap lead way lag behind, invest sustainable growth capacity euro area. the strength proposal lie collective, also temporary nature. structural transfer one country another quickly lead bad feeling, see elsewhere. that case recovery fund. the fund temporary, direct transfer countries, country assume responsibility other's debts. the recovery fund therefore excellent initiative. but enough, bring second item list. if want put end divergent growth europe also coordinate fiscal policy closely. in recent years, european fiscal rule particularly focus maximum budget deficit, well-known 3% gross domestic product. but result, practice rule prove strict bad times, ineffective good times. thus accentuate peak trough economy, instead smooth them. moreover, scant attention difference countries. for example, financial crisis 2008, country excessive deficit consolidate public finance roughly pace, regardless level public debt outset. there one lesson i think take this: need pay attention public debt levels. the maastricht treaty set public debt limit 60% gdp, although flexibility. you exceed threshold, long bring public debt back 60% reference value. this limit must regain prominence. it recognisable benchmark, allow country room temporarily increase debt economic downturns. however, pace country require return limit need vary now, take individual economic situation account. in economically favourable times, country high government debt level make great effort reduce debt country low debt levels.this justice difference start positions, european economy also benefit country tighten fiscal rein time. fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 10 in addition restore 60% limit, i believe reduce public debt, put emphasis reform promote economic growth. rather austerity measure often constrain growth first instance. without robust growth, simply difficult country high level public debt bring debt back healthy level relation size economy. we see that. if austerity unavoidable, fiscal rule least protect public investment. this investment, example infrastructure, sustainable energy, education science, often fall victim austerity measures. heavily indebted country see erosion economic growth potential due chronic under-investment. a result, leave lag even behind. if take another look netherlands, mean dutch fiscal policy forthcoming term government? dutch public debt expect increase around 50% 60% gdp come years. this sharp increase, thank comfortable start position, end level still manageable. that i see reason cut spend raise tax time. after all, economic recovery could still fragile 2021. what need strengthen growth potential dutch economy structural reform temporary, target investments. this course plea unbridle growth government spending. after all, always new, unexpected setbacks. so i think wise wary new policy initiative place structural burden government finances. this address fiscal policy europe netherlands. the third point european to-do list tackle growth imbalance improve coordination area economic policy. i already talk divergent competitiveness euro area member states. and contribute large trade surplus countries, large trade deficit others. to effectively tackle problem, member state must play part. weak economy need implement reform increase productivity competitiveness. this good exports, economic growth, employment, public debt. the point i want make reform likely succeed strong economy also fair share. for countries, mean implement reform give household room spend, boost import reduce trade surpluses. this help weak economies, also benefit strong ones. behind large persistent trade surpluses, often underlie problems, save retain company tax reasons, stagnant wage growth. if i apply netherlands moment, mean also work do. it mean critically review tax system, labour tax le heavily worker get retain pay. and need tackle imbalance labour market permanent flex workers, reduce tax difference contractual employee self-employed. a far i concerned, key challenge come term government. sum up, i talk recovery fund, coordination fiscal economic policies. so, cover everything, then? no, entirely. there still something else discuss. the recovery fund european head state agree one-off temporary solution. a i say before, i think strength lie precisely fact one-off temporary, i mean it. after all, euro area country primary responsibility ensure maintain healthy economy, consequently reform investment need achieve that. northern euro area country need reform bring high wage growth domestic demand. southern euro area country need reform become competitive reduce debt burden. but let's realistic: take time. even right policy place, country greece italy likely need decade get need be. in come year level public debt still high weather another recession without take far-reaching austerity measures, especially involve deep euro area-wide recession. they go great length maintain public investment circumstances. foreign investor thrill prospect structurally high tax burden. this mean risk country could fall behind again. which would overshadow objective create strong monetary union. fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 11 so, find way deal situations. to quite honest, i know best course action is. while recovery fund set relevant precedent, already establish structural transfer leave sour taste mouth. another option allow debt restructure within monetary union. this mean country meet main creditors, banks, discus reduce debt position without jeopardise euro membership. however, option without significant obstacle either - especially since major proportion debt still concentrate local banks. public debt write-down would lead significant loss local bank possibly also trigger capital flight, consequently still jeopardise country's euro membership. this roughly scenario play greece. so options⁠—a permanent fund well debt restructuring⁠—have own, serious impediments. a long issue divergent growth resolved, strong shoulder european caravan time time bear heavy load ensure no-one get leave behind. this require great deal serious think year ahead. all all, i believe agenda i outline would put u way strong currency union. with european government invest sustainable growth, individually work together. through closely align economic policy. alignment imply reciprocity, fair division right responsibilities. for us, netherlands, would mean relinquish degree national autonomy. i realise difficult step take. no country prepare give part sovereignty lightly. it take courage. and get return? the prospect stable prosperous monetary union, country equally share cost benefits. where positive balance cost benefit countries. so atmosphere untainted question bear heavy burden. create strong feel goodwill europe europe, make easy tackle together great challenge u today. in short, well-understood self-interest. some people say: even close european integration? now, times? there's public support that, there? to people i say this. we could also choose work towards european integration risk-sharing. that's also option, certainly. but price pay option. the price involve increase economic inequality euro countries, debt crises, emergency support low level prosperity. it would make euro unsustainable. and i fear globalise economy, price would ultimately paid, again, ordinary people. the people eponym lecture concerned. there people say become bite bad small price pay great freedom. to take back control. but really works? how much sovereign nation euro? when sell good abroad, always take customers’ preference account? our ancestor already aware age ago. these days, mean take board international rule regulations. we see country like switzerland norway, outside european union, many respect follow european rule without say rule made. we see country like denmark sweden, euro area, still strive exchange rate stability vis-à-vis euro. that mean generally accept euro area interest rate policy – also contribute recovery fund. and finally, see unite kingdom struggle find right balance sovereignty free trade. i believe european integration right option. will easy? no. do need public support? yes. so let u lay foundation support. and so, policymakers must clearly present pro con european integration, open discussion. they must take accountability decision make together brussels. and else, must make sure benefit european cooperation share equally everyone. brexit clearly show u absolutely necessary. final observation lady gentlemen. today, economic monetary union look quite different author maastricht treaty envisage back 1992. they expect economic difference member state lessen time, thank introduction euro support public finance regulations. that happen. fout! onbekende naam voor documenteigenschap. 12 we drift away forerunners’ expectation number respects. that inevitable. have decide rigidly stick spirit treaty low point crisis, would probably long monetary union. the world around u also changed. the significant geopolitical shifts, enormity challenge respect climate change refugees. this require cooperation european level. all same, live different monetary union imagine back 90s. with share risk. and harmonisation policy. in recent year push boundary treaty. there guarantee again. so crucial reaffirm political mandate. but central banker like one make decisions. it politician state preference present clearly voters. that i hope see spirit debate future europe run-up parliamentary election next spring. if want achieve strong healthy europe protect citizen risk hang them. if want achieve well-functioning europe work us. if want achieve sustainable europe ready future, must will takes. it require u good harmonise economic policies, jointly invest sustainable growth. firmly base member state assume responsibility put house order. with realisation member state must bit, include netherlands. and prospect create good future u all, ultimately. on 22 november 1989, 13 day fall berlin wall, jacques delors, european commission president, address european parliament. he speak task face european community momentous days. he said: “luck help sometimes; courage help always.” i wish politician much courage time ahead. thank *** i grateful alan sheppard, megan bell zachary morris-dyer assistance prepare speech. all speech available online .bankofengland../news/speeches @boe_pressoffice 1 ask economy insurer – ask insurer economy speech give anna sweeney, executive director, insurance supervision division deliver bank america 25th european financials ceo conference 22 september 2020 all speech available online .bankofengland../news/speeches @boe_pressoffice 2 2 good morning thank bank america invite speak today. in normal year, i would use remark run regulatory agenda. but year inevitable remark focus effect covid-19: human tragedy millions, bad economic crisis  several century unparalleled global challenge. our economy actor within continue face numerous challenge great deal uncertainty. the aim bank england – along colleague public sector institution – build bridge across economic disruption cause pandemic. and insurer – provider protection, guarantor retirement income institutional investor - important role play recovery crisis. with mind i’d like take opportunity today look ahead, challenge opportunity wait u side bridge –different, perhaps different world use live in. because face lot uncertainty. not speed recovery recession. but extent depth permanent structural change function economy bring adaptation covid-19 – i say, crucial role insurance industry play economic recovery. i want focus today specific risk bring insurance sector – though real large – role insurance sector regulatory framework support broad economic rebuild change landscape. not economy might insurers, insurer economy. of course manage risk support wide economy either/or choice. a virtuous circle operate provision financial services, strength economy, hence strength balance sheet provider financial service themselves. in case insurance seem likely continue provision new risk pool investment insurer strengthen economy hence exist exposure insurers’ balance sheets. and expect aggregate impact individual firms’ decision sector end 2019 hold asset region £2 trillion – figure broadly equivalent  gdp year – important influence speed recovery adaptation. but insurance sector economy?

spanish economic social council (ces) pablo hernández de  governor 23.07.2020 1 honourable minister labour social economy, chair spanish economic social council, lady gentlemen, good morning. it pleasure able participate today presentation annual report economic social council (ces). a early highlighted, content go beyond 2019 timeframe event delf challenge covid-19 pandemic entail economy, social cohesion labour market spain. in respect, ce banco de españa concur recent week respective study annual report strive useful instrument help society face challenge times. an incipient, incomplete, uncertain uneven recovery the covid-19 pandemic exact high price term human life well deep-seated disruption society economy. a result, dynamic mark global spanish economic environment late 2019 early 2020 abruptly altered. specifically, pandemic lockdown measure combat affect economy adversely. in spain’s case, set state alert affect last two week q1, witness biggest-ever contraction gdp historically single quarter, namely quarter-on-quarter rate 5.2%. this decline one pronounce euro area, response several circumstances. these include relatively great severity lockdown measure (given, too, great intensity pandemic) presence certain structural factor economy make vulnerable shock characteristics. the significant factor perhaps high weight tourism-related sectors, particularly affect social distance measures. the reduction hour worked, estimate 5% q1, also biggest-ever time series highlight mark impact various measure affect movement labour market early stage crisis. admittedly, restriction movement gradually ease early may. but state alert run much q2, whereby notable increase decline gdp employment period expected. the late banco de españa macroeconomic projections, publish june background unusually high uncertainty, post estimate quarter-on-quarter decline activity range -16% -21.8%. and information since available tend confirm decline economic activity q2 whole range. that said, improve path could see throughout q2, tandem ongoing gradual reopen economy. at present, then, witness incipient recovery economy, which, however, still incomplete, uncertain uneven. the correlation economic activity q2 intensity restriction people’s movement force point time high. thus, indicator measure people’s movement hit record low first two week april, decline around 80% motorway traffic fuel consumption, 90% case airport traffic. this reflect high-frequency indicator economic activity week lockdown stricter; then, example, saw reduction electricity 2 consumption firm consumer spend pay use card approximately 30% 60%, respectively. for april whole, unprecedented event time series variable fell practically zero. this case new car registration international tourist inflows, latter variable obviously closely relate restriction personal movement. since early may, great extent june, progressively stagger region-based ease lockdown measure prompt gradual recovery mobility indicator and, tandem, economic activity indicators. this particularly final stretch lockdown-easing process trip province different region arrival foreign tourist schengen area permitted. however, worth note role voluntary limitation movement probably continue play. these mean movement still way full normalisation, especially regard international movements, important country spain where, know, significance tourism within productive structure high. in late june, volume air traffic still 65% previous year. the recovery patent mobility indicators, tend mainly reflect national movement (such motorway traffic), indicator construct mobile telephony data, include trip workplaces, retail establishment leisure centres, year-on-year reduction around 15% instances. this path partial recovery mobility reflect high-frequency indicator economic activity, whose year-on-year decline progressively eased. by way example, fall electricity consumption firm expect ease open week april final week june close 20 pp, around - 10%. likewise, progressive re-opening commercial establishment deem non-essential since early may prompt pick-up retail sale month, markedly case product whose sale affect lockdown, personal equipment goods, home equipment motor fuel. this improvement consumer spend expect run june, accord information available payment make use cards. throughout q2, labour market move path recovery similar describe economic activity. consequently, fall social security registration ease may and, especially june, follow heavy decline record second half march april. in event, registration provide partial picture scale labour market adjustment since start crisis, insofar worker affect furlough-like scheme (ertes) continue consider

quarter confine health area. in particular, along adverse impact social distance measure may maintain future may exert activity, effect. this difficult measure priori relate possible potentially persistent change agents’ behaviour response “new normal”. these change might include modify pattern consumption saving, change supply chain certain aspect firms’ operations. all consideration would warrant qualify current recovery uncertain, take second adjective i use early characterise recovery. additionally, standpoint sector activity, suffer comparable scale consequence pandemic lockdown measures, equally susceptible imposition social distance measures. and gradual start-up activity take place pace different sectors. the early normalisation manufacture certain service coexist alongside slow usual recovery level activity services, leisure hospitality, personal interaction greater. here, full normalisation likely attain effective medical solution. these difference pace normal level activity productive sector restore allow u characterise recovery uneven, take last three adjectives. the economic policy response second phase crisis naturally, economic policy response crisis adapt pandemic unfold healthwise. at second phase crisis, characteristic i mentioned, economic policy response must combine two objectives: support recovery - advise avoid premature withdrawal support measure would raise risk economic growth undergo last damage - smooth adjustment economy post-pandemic scenario. 4 the importance european support to achieve objectives, economic policy response second phase crisis firmly resolute back european union (eu). indeed, give enormous economic financial interaction across area’s various economies, joint action effective mean ensure economic effect pandemic overcome short time low cost every country. this particularly important current situation, face global crisis, exert asymmetrical economic effect different countries. european action particularly important avoid uneven exit crisis bear overall economic growth long period. these arguments, beyond relate necessary european solidarity, highlight importance agreement reach european council last tuesday approval european recovery fund. in fact, know, result european council meet day back was, i would venture say, satisfactory. first, agreement reach eu multiyear budget 2021-2027, negotiation face many difficulty recent months, amount €1,074 billion. further, recovery fund (next generation eu) created. this additional budget introduce pan-european recovery finance framework unprecedented history eu. this fund finance european commission’s recourse, behalf union, capital markets, maximum amount €750 billion 2021 2026, i.e. temporary nature. the fund assign tackle consequence covid-19 crisis, loan member state (48% total) direct transfer (essentially remain 52%). the gradual amortisation debt run 2058, new eu resources. to swiftly mobilise aid, take form investment project finance structural reforms, area research, progress digitalisation combat climate change, european commission will, european council’s october meeting, submit proposal accelerate smooth procedure member states. accord draft agreement, legal spend commitment attach project include next generation eu shall made, latest, 31 december 2023, relate payment make effective, latest, end-2026. more specifically, 70% transfer commit 2021-2022 two-year period, country-based distribution factor depend unemployment rate 2015-2019, population country’s per caput income. the remain 30% must commit end-2023, distribution factor adapt incorporate directly heterogeneous impact health crisis. thus, unemployment rate replace variable weight, equal portions, decline gdp 2020 cumulative decline gdp 2020-2021. in sum, fund enable, least part, balance strike potential real financial divergence among european partners. this benefit positive externality arise joint action serve engineer coordinate exit crisis, base common budgetary instruments. the finance fund community debt benefit favourable low-interest-rate environment prevent new debt assume member state individually, condition which, cases, would foreseeably unfavourable 5 expect apply pool instrument. give novel nature instrument, amount difficulty reach agreement eu multi-faceted matters, i must say outcome satisfactory term underscore share move european project forward. the challenge convert fund make available country fiscal impulse accompany steer recovery effort need productive system. in connection would advisable prioritise, short term, public investment project innovation, technological capital, education lifelong learning, project contribute transition sustainable economy, line strategic guideline recently lay european authorities. the fact recovery fund agree council focus medium long-term objective mean still significant need short term fund member states’ budgetary effort combat effect pandemic. also, medium term remain necessary equip eu appropriate institutional framework address asymmetrical effect economic shocks, e.g. launch common budgetary macroeconomic stabilisation capacity, cyclical stabilisation function pan-european unemployment insurance scheme. that would influence great pool resource risk budgetary arena would enhance resilience union whole negative shocks. reduce european economy’s vulnerability future shock also call continue progress towards full bank union capital market union. the necessary support european central bank on occasion, unlike previous crises, approval european recovery fund prevent european response crisis euro area rest exclusively common monetary policy. the european central bank (ecb) deploy range emergency measure crisis. these involved, first, extension sovereign corporate bond purchase euro area, aim improve finance conditions. specifically, ecb increase pre-existing purchase programme add new emergency programme currently worth €1.35 trillion (11.3% euro area gdp 2019) last, least, june 2021. one new feature fact asset purchase new programme make high degree flexibility regard distribution time across asset classes, and, specific case public asset purchases, also regard issue countries. a result, eurosystem focus purchase need point time. the aim ensure smooth transition single monetary policy country area head risk financial fragmentation. the ecb also make liquidity provision facility accessible bank sector, term cost volume, relax requirement make asset pledge collateral, order smooth finance households, firm self-employed. all measure effective alleviate financial tension generate crisis. these tension take form strong rise sovereign corporate debt yields, largely reversed. the ecb’s action also help keep bank lend flow 6 company notably robust recent month contribute cost hold low levels. also crucial dynamic government-implemented public guarantee programme bank lending. the ecb measure provide considerable room manoeuvre national authorities. in second phase crisis, recovery economic activity is, i said, incomplete, fragile uneven across sector countries, actual inflation inflation expectation hold low levels. and expect medium term weakness demand continue exert downward pressure prices. against background, ecb govern council make clear high degree monetary accommodation need support recovery safeguard price stability objective. specifically, reiterate commitment take support euro area economy extremely difficult circumstances. that include ensure common monetary policy properly transmit sector economy countries, prevent financial fragmentation area. we also stand ready adapt instrument necessary. naturally, must also remain vigilant regard risk financial stability. evidently, bank sector face crisis healthy position previous recession, highlight importance far-reaching change make sector past decade. the ecb also take resolute action here. among measures, allow bank use capital buff available, create precisely situation present one. but, undoubtedly, crisis significantly impact quality banks’ credit portfolios, scale depend ultimate severity uneven across banks. the outcome depend banks’ start position, business model distribution exposure sector region affect pandemic. accordingly, supervisor must continue closely monitor risk financial stability must ready provide forceful, pan-european response risk materialise. in short, european national economic authority must share objective prevent current crisis accompany across-the-board tighten finance condition seriously harm stability financial system. we well aware crisis incorporate significant financial downturn usually deep longer-lasting. the health crisis directly affect profitability european bank sector. such profitability already low crisis broke, event highlight need tackle even urgently certain challenges, associate digitalisation, management cybersecurity risks, reputational risk relate climate change. this underscore importance make headway improve bank efficiency. give extraordinarily prevalent role play sector spanish european economy, successfully challenge resolve notably influence intensity sustainability economic growth come years. the importance extension selective adaptation national stimulus measure in national economic policy arena, achieve dual aim support recovery smooth adjustment economy post-pandemic scenario call two actions. first, authority must extend regularly recalibrate 7 measure already applied, closely focus group firms, sector individual affected. and further, design enable structural adjustment need ahead new post-pandemic environment bring about. allow illustrate idea relation two measure particularly important recent months: policy guarantee ertes. indeed, notable reduction business activity restriction associate state alert prompt much sharp decline non-financial corporations’ operate revenue payment must meet. the late central balance sheet data office figure give idea severity shock firms’ liquidity. there strongly adverse impact agents’ profit already q1, despite fact sharp contraction activity operate revenue associate declaration state alert affect last two week quarter. the reduction return asset overall sample firm significant push roa cost borrowing, development see since 2014. the information bank lend show firm resort source finance cover large portion liquidity requirements. specifically, outstanding balance bank finance grant spanish non-financial corporation rise 8.7% may shrink 1.1% year-on-year february. and preliminary data june would suggest trajectory hold recent period. yet financial institution able meet notable increase firms’ application credit, contribution support measure launch european national level decisive. on one hand, bank able gain access ecb’s long-term finance advantageous condition thank purpose-built programme introduce ecb. on other, public guarantee loan firm self-employed approve government contribute lessen financial institutions’ potential reluctance take new risk board uncertain setting. analysis banco de españa base evidence available suggest guarantee facility are, particular, pave way finance firm face great difficulty gain access credit small enterprises, mark affect impact health crisis great risk profile. thank guarantees, smes able finance recent month favourable condition term interest rate, amount credit and, all, maturity operation, average stand close five years. the role lend company current crisis thus prove great importance. it contribute reduce risk bankruptcy firm viable face temporary liquidity problems, adverse consequence would term job destruction damage productive system, and, sum, robustness momentum economic recovery. 8 the launch new ico (official credit institute) line guarantees, recently announce government worth €40 billion, significantly reinforce timely juncture important instrument combat economic effect pandemic. against backdrop, find late bank lend survey anticipate possibility tighten credit standard european firm q3 year. should confirmed, prolong increase support measure finance firm would advisable, order sustain recovery. in event, second phase economic policy response, credit support mechanism focus prioritise access fund firm sound viability prospects, view provide necessary cross-firm cross-sector reallocation productive resources. likewise, admittedly highly likely significant number firm emerge crisis high debt level diminish demand prospects, least time. in respect, also press concern review corporate restructure insolvency processes, aim establish pre-emptive, flexible simplify administrative procedure enable firm pursue business activity still viable. the second decisive contribution economic policy alleviate consequence crisis use furlough arrangement (ertes). this also important instrument mitigate firms’ liquidity needs. but, all, key tool ensure maintenance affect employees’ income improve prospect recoup employment restriction activity impose state alert lifted. the particular characteristic shock, temporarily shut many workplaces, incentive approve use instrument state alert declare contribute much great resort ertes past crises. hence, focus arrangement available permanent employees, end-april number worker affect erte total 3.4 million. since then, figure fall significantly. moreover, information available, small portion wage-earners emerge situation go unemployment become idle, whereas affect return pre-crisis job. these development qualitatively consistent objective pursued; namely, ertes would temporarily use tool transitory shutdown activity lasted. in late june, coincide end lockdown-easing, 1.8 million worker continue avail erte. this figure almost half end-april peak account close 10% total wage-earners, confirm one characteristic recovery incompleteness. from standpoint labour market, also uneven recovery. this reduction number worker ertes uneven across productive sectors. with lockdown-easing concluded, service segment still affect restriction operate normally, proportion worker affect furlough arrangement continue majority. this case accommodation, air transport travel agency segment where, end-june, reach ertes still 70.4% 53.7%. the high proportion worker protect erte specific service segment strike contrast 9 percentage manufacture industry construction (8.9% 4.2%, respectively). that highlight deeply asymmetric effect crisis different productive activities. in absolute terms, end q2 almost half worker ertes retail hospitality sectors. in response situation high uncertainty recovery, erte support measure - initially program end-june - extended, albeit amendments, end q3. the new condition include possibility increase social security exemption event fresh outbreak virus, explicit acknowledgement uncertainty surround recovery. these new condition also attempt square objective continue provide support firm worker temporarily affect restriction operate normally aim provide incentive progressive reallocation employment towards activity good future outlook. in parallel role ertes, important ensure proper function different labour flexibility mechanism available firms, whose function particularly useful circumstance efficiently accomplish adjustment arise crisis. active labour market train policy unemployed worker affect ertes also take considerable importance. once suitably re-designed, policy gear boost employability smooth relocation worker affect crisis sector firm great growth potential. the criterion whereby support instrument maintained, appropriately design distort necessary adjustment economy, also important. and particularly expressly intend sustain income vulnerable households. the necessary implementation ambitious structural reform agenda let u look beyond policy need phase incipient economic recovery. take broad view, extraordinarily complex set envisage banco de españa’s late economic projection - vast majority analyst - come year also mean define reform agenda aim tackle structural challenge economy faces, crisis make pressing. in setting, ambitious reform strategy would essential lever position spanish economy sustainable path growth, job creation well-being. one key structural challenge relate need increase economy’s growth potential. before pandemic broke, banco de españa estimate place spanish economy’s growth potential slightly 1% per annum. it soon accurately ass scale damage current crisis cause potential growth. but, unquestionably, impact negative and, therefore, growth capacity look ahead might low estimate crisis. the main factor behind spanish economy’s modest potential growth is, undoubtedly, low structural growth total factor productivity. these difference underestimated, since productivity gain fundamental ingredient achieve 10 sustainable increase country’s economic well-being. indeed, great gain are, great possibility raise wage level quality job created, along increase resource fund public policies. it thus necessary address various structural aspect which, across board, restrict productivity gains. in connection, must improve quantity quality public private investment human technological capital, revise educational model promote business growth dynamism. elsewhere, labour market duality, high structural unemployment rate high long-term unemployment restrict growth capacity also contribute increase inequality. in fact, since 1980 unemployment rate spain average almost 17%, figure far high observe european countries. moreover, however, unemployment spain historically show mark cyclical changes: episode crisis, unemployment rate easily exceed 20%. this mean recession expulses extensive group worker market, particularly le work experience, low skill and, generally, temporary contract and, therefore, low degree protection. true, mark temporary employment ratio spanish labour market show damage effect period crisis. but also adverse economic effect expansionary phase (e.g. term firms’ workers’ human capital investment decisions). in addition, insofar temporary employment ratio essentially affect young, whose unemployment rate high, spanish labour market shortcoming also influence key decision people’s life cycle relate household formation. for reasons, reduce high duality labour market is, view, inescapable objective. thus, employment protection mechanism review prism square employee protection flexibility needs, but, all, aim achieve fair distribution protection among worker different contract status. we also recall how, current crisis, almost 43% unemployed seek job year around 30% look two years. the situation worsen current crisis, whereby vital strengthen role policy aim increase employability vulnerable worker prevent unemployment become structural. it worth note sector potentially affect crisis (among transport, hospitality, leisure retail) account almost 20% employment country. but, moreover, sector evidence great concentration le skilled worker le expose it-, numeracy- literacy-related tasks. that hamper employability worker productive sector foreseeably good growth prospect near future. improve active labour market policy also necessary medium-term horizon. undoubtedly, technological advance (artificial intelligence, automation robotics) create new opportunity contribute much-needed gain productivity. but worker lose job transition always position instantly take advantage new opportunities. accordingly, active labour 11 market train policies, duly re-designed boost effectiveness efficiency, appropriate fund behind them, natural lever ensure lifelong-learning workers. this enable acquire new skills, hone recycle professionally change foreseeably demand environment term technological skills. in sum, reform contribute increase economy’s growth potential. and along income-sustaining measure (such minimum live income), help reduce inequality spain. inequality levels, high onset crisis start previous one, probably rise come quarters, give crisis affect group relatively low income great extent. nor forget need address ongoing population age which, among aspects, appreciably influence behaviour labour market, growth dynamic main fiscal magnitude come decades. it also first-order challenge pension system. and, course, spanish economy must nimble proactive harness new opportunity arise combat climate change transition sustainable economy, change globalisation model foreseeable acceleration digitalisation economy. the prompt design medium-term fiscal consolidation programme gradual implementation crisis behind u after pandemic, spanish economy post high level public debt many decades, partly result necessary fiscal expansion short term. accordingly, also necessary design plan restore health public finance medium term, application which, event, postpone recovery firmly rooted. otherwise, persistently high public debt/gdp ratio leave u chronically vulnerable possibility adverse macrofinancial shock arise future. this programme include clear definition budgetary objective timeframe, along detail measure need attain them. it also base prudent forecast macroeconomic developments. further, include appropriate response possible slippage, compatible improvement quality public finances. in respect, priority expenditure side subject various item exhaustive review, aim identify area room improve efficiency. it important recommendation airef’s assessment take account soon possible. we also need comprehensive review tax system, order improve revenue-raising capacity efficiency. comparison european country guide u here. and, again, result airef’s recently publish review tax benefit significant contribution connection. 12 conclusion in sum, follow unprecedented recession, face gradual recovery economy, still incomplete uneven, subject high uncertainty. against background, ecb’s action since onset crisis recent approval european recovery plan also unprecedented common european response. for response effective, must accompany national economic policy response befit european action challenge face. this response call following: maintain support fiscal policy economy, temporary basis, focus group firms, sector individual affect design allow structural adjustment needed; convert european fund fiscal impulse accompany steer recovery effort productive system; urgently implement ambitious, comprehensive, last assessable strategy reform tackle structural challenge economy; and, finally, design medium-term fiscal consolidation programme, gradual implementation economic crisis cause pandemic behind us, ensure sustainability public finance enable fiscal buff build use future recessionary episodes. the future well-being country depend economic policy strategy combine principles. thus, i stress occasions, opinion high degree consensus among various political, economic social agent regard guide principle strategy, foundation growth rest predictable lasting. thank you. dimitar radev: the bank enter current crisis well-preparedthanks do recent yearsspeech mr dimitar radev, governor bulgarian

(2020) use u data show employee lockdown sector typically low level education, low income low save employee outside sector directly affect measures.[4]beland et al. (2020) obtain similar results.[5] social distance rule could thus contribute increase income inequality.chetty et al.

different group households, base income, education, age renter versus owners. our general find inflation rate construct specific consumer group similar measure cpi inflation rate.9 simply put, perception group consistent results. to illustrate point, let’s take age example. we construct different cpi basket young, middle-aged senior household calculate inflation rate group (chart 4). the result show that, regardless different composition baskets, age group’s average inflation rate track closely actual, measure cpi.10 take analysis further, let’s go back perception report csce age group. chart 5 clearly show young consumer much high volatile inflation expectation two age groups, certainly high measure rate. 9 while find generally holds, low income household renter experience modestly low rate inflation compare average canadian household last five year (on average 0.2 percentage points). the low inflation rate group explain fact spend large share basket rent small portion

explain this. and we’ve also consider way consumers’ behaviour understand shape way perceive inflation. the next logical question would be: what role central bank guide consumers’ expectation towards 2 percent inflation target? and important? inflation expectation conduct monetary policy let’s tackle last question first. to so, i think it’s relevant look exist inflation-control agreement bank government canada. the agreement state that: “the well-established credibility framework reinforce canadian public’s confidence monetary policy continue achieve inflation target, help underpin canadian economy challenge times.” the key word “public’s confidence.” because inflation expectation key determinant economic behaviour outcomes,21 important consumer understand bank’s commitment inflation target. the confidence canadian commitment, anchor belief behaviour 2 percent target. put another way, people shrug temporary movement inflation believe inflation remain target long run. their confidence inflation remain close 2 percent help keep inflation rate allow economy stabilize short-term bumps. a result confidence, bank flexibility see temporary movement inflation. we keep “steady hand” conduct monetary policy, goal keep inflation sustainably target. however, context large persistent shock, start covid-19 pandemic early year, credible inflation target even important. with inflation expectation well anchored, bank able effectively respond march unprecedented adverse shock. one action take reduce policy interest rate 150 basis point three announcements. because

(amendments conduct legislation currently parliament view strengthen regulation conduct financial institution (financial market (conduct institutions) amendment bill). by contrast, prudential regulation institutional soundness, promote maintenance sound efficient financial system. the reserve bank’s philosophical approach administer ipsa base three pillar self-discipline, market discipline regulatory discipline. self-discipline closely link governance; hence framework place primary responsibility insurer’s business board senior management. market discipline influence market place insurer operate business prudently. recognise market participant le information insurer insurer know market discipline seek address imbalance, degree, ensure disclosure 6 information. one example requirement insurer disclosure financial strength rat customers. the regulatory pillar essentially fill gap risk appetite outcome solely achieve self-discipline market-discipline. our risk appetite proxy public’s risk appetite (informed public consultation parliamentary processes). it low risk appetite individual insurer take account cost failure bear insurer other, external parties. minimum requirement impose ipsa therefore design conservative insurer’s management would choose absence regulation. this mean ipsa intend prevent insurance failures. whilst sound efficient insurance sector systemically important, failure single company doesn’t usually large spill-over consequence rest financial system. so moderate tolerance individual entity failure. we also differentiate supervisory intensity insurer accord judgement relative impact failure would have, combine risk failure, generally mean focus supervisory resource large insurers. the key ipsa provision (the regulatory pillar) cover capital strength, risk management, governance, fit proper requirement key personnel insurer run prudently. some provision relate directly protect policyholder interests, requirement life insurer maintain statutory fund protect long-term life insurance assets. we also bolster regulatory pillar intensive supervision enforcement, discuss below. it important emphasise role prudential supervision regulation dictate commercial term insurer provide insurance. for example, seek influence trend towards risk-based pricing. rather, involvement good understand go on, consider impact soundness

transfer business insurers, change control insurer enter exit market. the amp/resolution life transaction notable example. ipsa power also use relation solvency-level set insurers, well area risk management. the canterbury earthquakes, commence day enactment ipsa, result intense period supervisory activity application ipsa provisions. some administrative feature ipsa prove cumbersome utilise could improved. issue arise amongst insurer relation matter capital management quality risk management governance sometimes reveal scope improvement form specific definition guidance. 8 more specific provision definition clear guidance matter would reduce scope outcome quite dependent firm’s interpretation sufficient self-discipline. solvency margin set one area provision might make specific. we intend re-start review solvency standard alongside broad ipsa review october, apply regulatory pillar philosophy evaluate prudential safety risks. solvency standard define amount capital insurer require hold protect cost unforeseen events. a criticism approach towards capital adequacy within current solvency standard represent something “all nothing” solvency measure whereby solvency ratio 100% (or alternative regulate figure) take adequate ratio le 100% take inadequate. think give graduate approach one level capital requirement. use approach, different level capital requirement provide trigger point intervention. the close trigger point minimum capital requirement, great level supervisory intensity intervention. any buff statutory minimum currently discretion insurer, although reserve bank impose high solvency margin licence conditions. over years, observe decline trend solvency margin may illustrative key difference approach insurer prudential regulator. insurer must balance need maintain sensible level capital strength expectation investor return investment. high level capital make resilient insurer cost low return equity. prudential regulator tend focus low probability high impact risks, ‘tail end risks’, concern what-ifs event extreme impacts. of course, check balance exist within insurers, without prudential oversight, competitive force alone always compatible adequately address tail end risks. in words, risk-appetite equity-holders always compatible risk-appetite society. the outcome solvency buff minimum get thin which, definition, mean risk insurer breach minimum solvency requirement increasing. the retention capital, largely dividend payment withheld, see recent, probably temporary, change overall trend. i’ll come later. 9 an over-arching consideration review solvency standard assessment impact change introduction ifrs 17 bring. ifrs 17 international financial report standard that, 1 january 2023, replace ifrs 4 account

apply overseas requirement assess meet equivalence ipsa restrict provision relation solvency, governance fit proper matters. some overseas insurer active new zealand threshold activity trigger license

long-term challenge japan's economy: with eye post-covid-19 era speech meet councillor nippon keidanren (japan business federation) tokyo bank japan december 24, 2020 kuroda haruhiko governor bank japan (english translation base japanese original) 1 introduction it great honor opportunity address distinguish gather business leader japan today. for eight year now, i deliver speech end-of-year meeting, i say year experience enormous change social economic environment due shock novel coronavirus (covid-19). a wrap 2020, i would first like take look back economic development year, mainly focus impact covid-19, talk outlook economic activity prices. then, i explain bank japan's think behind policy responses. in relation conduct monetary policy, i also touch conduct assessment effective sustainable monetary easing, bank decide monetary policy meet (mpm) hold last week. lastly, i would like talk necessary take advantage lesson learn overcome current crisis future growth -- is, challenge regard japan's economy whole address also look ahead post-covid-19 era medium- long-term perspective. i. economic price development covid-19 era their outlook impact covid-19 economy let start look back economic development year, mainly focus impact covid-19. covid-19 start spread begin year become pandemic within short period toward early spring (chart 1). government around world take strict wide-ranging public health measure order prevent spread. under circumstances, global economy become depress significantly. however, since summer season, public health measure eased, global economy pick state significant depression, see growth rate country turn positive quarter-on-quarter basis. similar development observe japan. the quarter-on-quarter gdp growth rate april-june quarter register considerably negative figure minus 8.3 percent wide-ranging economic activity 2 constrained. however, july-september quarter turn positive, 5.3 percent, japan's economy pick bottom, although remain severe situation. the economic fluctuation time different nature see past. most fluctuation since world war ii trigger cyclical adjustment business fix investment inventory investment, financial imbalances. on hand, current fluctuation exceptional, stem shock cause infectious disease, inherent economy, economic activity constrain exogenously view prevent spread disease. in words, activity affect largely epidemiologic factor. reflect characteristic covid-19, economic activity involve social interaction particularly affected, another point unique current case (chart 2). look economic activity firm japan sector, significant decline see industry face-to-face service eat drink well accommodation -- firm relatively small -- amusement service include events. in term household spending, consumption service decline considerably compare goods. a constraint service consumption due vigilance covid-19, difference consumption behavior age group reflect degree vigilance. that is, service consumption young generation recover rapidly, whereas seniors, strongly vigilant covid-19, saw significant decline pick slow pace. in contrast, manufacture retail firms, produce sell goods, relatively le affected. good transaction worldwide pick comparatively fast pace (chart 3). a decline global trade activity small compare time global financial crisis (gfc) rapid recovery observed. under circumstances, level japan's export return see prior covid-19 outbreak, rapid pace. this lead manufacturers' relatively steady production activity. 3 a i explain thus far, impact shock covid-19 uneven largely vary attribute industry size firm well consumers' ages. at current phase particular, suggest need closely examine economic development look aggregate average value data, also analyze development different attribute economic entity. outlook economic development now, let move outlook japan's economy. in baseline scenario, project that, impact covid-19 wan gradually, japan's economy follow improve trend, albeit moderately, also support pick-up overseas economy (chart 4). compare early spring, many country make response strike balance preventive measure economic activity. it true pace economic recovery likely remain moderate continue impact covid-19. however, also true that, take advantage experience since spring, level economic activity increase gradually, society overall adapt "new lifestyle" take target preventive measures. a baseline scenario, expect development continue. that said, outlook entail high uncertainties, risk skew downside. although recent positive news vaccine certainly encouraging, still likely take time become widely available. on hand, necessary pay attention fact spread covid-19 continue globally number confirm case resurge japan well. in addition, uncertainty whether, impact covid-19 remains, growth expectation decline substantially financial system stability maintained. thus, bank continue closely examine economic development home abroad. recent development outlook price next, let u look price development japan (chart 5). the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) exclude fresh food negative. this attributable temporary factor past decline crude oil price discount hotel charge "go to travel" campaign. however, even though decrease 4 demand due impact covid-19 constrain inflation, year-on-year rate change cpi slightly positive exclude effect temporary factors. the year-on-year rate change cpi likely negative time being. thereafter, expect turn positive increase gradually effect temporary factor push price dissipate economy improve (chart 4). at present, bank judge price see overall sustain decline; words, economy return deflation. however, attention also continue pay price development give pace economic improvement moderate uncertainty economic outlook significant. ii. the bank's conduct monetary policy monetary policy conduct response covid-19 financial development so far, i talk development economic activity prices. now, i explain bank's think behind monetary policy conduct response covid-19. to address global shock covid-19, government central bank around world swiftly make policy response large scale. government implement large-scale economic measure include income support loan guarantee firm households. central bank conduct monetary ease measures, response two thing common. one provide support finance firm sole proprietor affect covid-19 sustain businesses. the maintain stability financial market order prevent vicious cycle turmoil market deterioration real economy. in regard, bank conduct powerful monetary ease since march response covid-19 follow three measure (chart 6). specifically, first special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19) provide support mainly corporate financing. the second ample flexible provision funds, mainly purchase japanese government bond (jgbs) conduct u.s. dollar funds-supplying operations, ensure stability financial 5 markets. the third active purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits) low risk premia asset markets. the bank's response positive effects, couple government's measure active effort financial institution (chart 7). a financial conditions, although firms' financial position weak, environment external fund remain accommodative. the year-on-year rate change amount outstanding bank lend register high increase 30 year back banks' accommodative lend attitudes. that aggregate amount outstanding cp corporate bond high level exceed 10 percent. thus, smooth function financial intermediation ensured, big difference time gfc, downward pressure financial side real economy intensified. in addition, global financial markets, highly volatile, regain stability early time case gfc due large-scale response make government central bank around world, include bank japan. extension special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19) however, economic activity price project remain downward pressure prolong period due impact covid-19 (chart 8). give situation, view support economy thereby achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank decide last week's mpm upon follow two response make respectively time somewhat long-term perspective. the first one extension special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19). with economy improve moderate pace, corporate finance likely remain stress time being. give circumstances, bank decide extend duration special program end september 2021, consider extension necessary. the bank continue firmly support corporate financing. 6 assessment further effective sustainable monetary ease the second response conduct assessment effective sustainable monetary ease view achieve price stability target 2 percent. it find make public, likely march 2021 mpm. the bank pursue large-scale monetary ease since 2013. in summer 2016, three year introduction, bank conduct comprehensive assessment examine effects. the find indicate that, large-scale monetary easing, financial condition improve significantly, see correction past excessive appreciation yen decline stock prices, lead improvement corporate profit economic activity. on point, i would think recognize development significant improvement business environment compare past. on hand, find regard price reveal follow two points. first, although economy, cpi positive whole, long deflation sense sustain decline prices, price stability target 2 percent achieved. second, people's mindset behavior base assumption wage price increase easily deeply entrench prolong deflation, turn still take long time mindset behavior change. in addition, find also make clear monetary ease could cumulative negative impact financial institutions' profit well life insurance pension funds, turn could adversely affect function financial intermediation. a policy response base find comprehensive assessment, bank introduce "quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control" september 2016. through framework, control policy interest rate appropriate level take consideration positive side effect monetary easing, thereby maintain favorable economic financial condition -- is, favorable business environment business manager -- create large-scale monetary easing. 7 the upcoming assessment conduct find comprehensive assessment mind. "qqe yield curve control" work well four year since introduction date, include past 10 month covid-19 pandemic. thus, bank judge need change framework. under framework, ass whether manner operation various policy tools, include asset purchases, intend effects. in pursuit effective sustainable monetary ease toward achieve price stability target 2 percent, anything done, bank so. the key "effective" "sustainable" monetary easing. since monetary ease inevitably prolong due impact covid-19, bank devise way continue conduct "qqe yield curve control." that said, simply maintain prolong period enough. if conduct become rigid, work appropriately. a evidence sudden occurrence current shock covid-19, various shock may happen future. thus, necessary nimble make effective response need counter possible change economic activity prices, well financial conditions. this matter course business manager like all, measure incur costs, monetary policy measures. prolong low interest rate negative impact financial institutions' profits, purchase various asset jgbs etf affect market functioning. such cost side effect need minimized. that said, management goal cannot achieve curb costs. i believe business management produce significant positive effect low costs. anything unnecessary inefficient avoided, focus assessment low cost mitigate side effects. instead, bank adopt forward-looking perspective achieve stability economic activity price pursue effective monetary ease mitigate side effects. 8 iii. strengthen japan's economic growth potential eye post-covid-19 era the covid-19 pandemic still affect global economy enormous scale, many people japan make strenuous effort toward it. above all, necessary simultaneously contain spread covid-19 improve economic activity order overcome current crisis. at time, give current situation also look ahead time overcome crisis -- is, post-covid-19 era -- important focus challenge regard japan's economy whole firmly push forward address make good use insight gain experience. look past experience burst bubble financial crises, major shock often follow period prolong low growth (chart 9). example include japan aftermath burst bubble economy financial crisis second half 1990s, well develop economy overall follow gfc. what happen japan's economy, suffer deflation, clearly illustrate social cost address prolong low growth ex post high. base experiences, government central bank around world make every effort prevent much possible covid-19 shock create "scarring effects," long-lasting aftereffect economy. generally speaking, growth potential economy determine three factors: labor input, capital input, total factor productivity, represent technological progress. the reason prolong low growth wake major shock often divide follow three causes: (1) hysteresis effects, where, example, increase unemployment time shock affect labor input recovery period; (2) stagnation capital input due constraint business fix investment; (3) stagnation technological progress. it important address issue order get economy back steady growth path impact covid-19 subsides. i would like talk three issues, i believe crucial medium- long-term perspective. 9 labor input: maintain improve workers' skill the first issue labor input. the hysteresis effect economic crisis regard labor input refer fact lose job due employment adjustment face decline skill exit labor market, consequently effect subsequent labor input. while problem often highlight europe unite states, also warrant attention japan, evidence fact so-called employment ice age generation, first become issue nearly two decade ago, still problem today. in order make issue hysteresis effect regard labor input worse, important contain number unemployed much possible event shock. in response current shock, many country provide support retain employee sustain businesses, also effective term address issue regard hysteresis effect labor input. japan, too, experience significant increase unemployment bankruptcy due effort make firm financial institution together government's employment adjustment subsidy subsidy sustain businesses, well government's bank's support finance (chart 10). however, need do long run term labor input. that is, firm need upgrade skill employee able adapt structural change economy. since major change business environment result pandemic, firm able sustain adequate competitiveness simply maintain workers' skills. even outbreak covid-19, often case shortage relevant human resource constrain expansion businesses. with ongoing effort toward digitalization, shortage human resource information technology press issue. in order respond boldly major changes, firm make effort improve workers' skill in-house train also acquire new skill exchange human resource industries. it important firm step effort already make improve workers' skill order adapt structural changes. 10 capital input: capital stock accumulation business fix investment the next issue capital input. one reason prolong low growth major crisis accumulation necessary capital stock hampered. that is, aftermath crisis corporate profit deteriorate, economic uncertainty increase, fund environment worsens, business fix investment constrain excessively, firms' continue cautious stance lead prolong stagnation capital accumulation. let u look past business fix investment stance firm japan (chart 11). follow burst bubble economy, remain reluctant make fix investment long period prolong deflation. however, i mention meet last year, firm surely become active fix investment recent years, mainly back high level profits. during situation, early year, hit shock covid-19. it true high level save remain hand even make active investment mitigate impact shock. however, important thing excessively cautious investment base experience negatively affect future competitiveness. i think firm well aware point. many say that, despite shock, continue make necessary investment, give significantly constrain fix investment gfc subsequently lose competitiveness. when look ahead post-covid-19 era well, i think important interrupt positive trend see outbreak, invest aggressively future. technological progress: continue investment growth technological progress also important (chart 12). there many example like gfc where, aftermath crisis, technological progress stagnate productivity growth economy whole remain weak accordingly. one reason lack research development (r&d) investment. when firm become reluctant make investment, innovation le likely happen introduction advance technology delayed. thus, necessary technological progress make investment growth medium- long-term perspective make innovative effort base investment. in regard, noteworthy sign that, spite 11 current severe economic environment, move toward digitalization see various level country, include firms. in fact, software investment remain steady compare overall business fix investment. it encourage see firm maintain stance create innovation investment growth. thus far, i explain key point bring japan's economy back sustainable growth path medium- long-term perspective base labor input, capital input, technological progress. of course, one know point so-called new normal economy look like pandemic subsided. however, i talk meet past, face significant change, firm achieve substantial growth one step ahead turn change opportunity. progress effort address environmental issue view achieve sustainable development goal (sdgs) one example. i believe many firm consider address issue meet social demand also enhance competitiveness social set come. i hope firm boldly take various challenge view raise future growth potential. conclusion today, i talk development japan's economy, outlook, bank's response covid-19, well effort require also look ahead post-covid-19 era. the pandemic remind u importance social interaction. while people take advantage use virtual tool continue daily communication, i believe crave everyday uncomplicated, face-to-face interaction drive force action development vaccines. such strong motivation catalyst great change. the challenge u society whole make harsh experience covid-19. a i mention today, turn economic change opportunities, i believe japan's economy stagnate post-pandemic, instead leap forward. to make happen, active effort private sector essential. of course, public 12 sector firmly support efforts. the bank continue provide accommodative financial condition order strongly support transformative moves. lastly, i would like conclude speech today wish wonderful year ahead. thank attention. december 24, 2020kurodaharuhikogovernor bank japanresponse covid-19

enhance inclusiveness financethe nature socialism chinese characteristic determine financial sector mustcater hundred million people country. in capitalist society, finance animportant cause polarization. amid covid-19 pandemic, gap rich thepoor country widening, largely attribute considerable divergence oftheir financial market real economy. for instance, stock market countryhas witness exceptional boom, reflect fact since begin year,the increase market cap five large company account 80 percent totalrises market. here china, however, shall remain even commit newdevelopment

speech vitas vasiliauskas: welcome speech - bank lithuania real estateconferencewelcome speech mr vitas vasiliauskas, chairman board bank lithuania, atthe virtual bank lithuania real estate conference, 24 november 2020.* * *check deliverygood morning, dear real estate experts, conference attendees, dear colleagues,i happy welcome eighth annual bank lithuania real estate conference.throughout history, real estate conference hold various venues. this year –not exactly choice – meet virtually first time ever. i must admit – time weare act pro-cyclical manner. the bank lithuania able save money havingto rent separate physical space conference. however, also means, course, thatthe commercial real estate market and, perhaps, conference participant orattendees lose income.therefore, pandemic inevitably one way another affect everyone everything,including foundation lithuanian real estate market. for instance, observe aslowdown growth house price previous lockdown. expectation realestate industry also take turn worse: survey show majority ofcommercial bank start expect fall real estate prices, particularly segment ofcommercial real estate.however, prediction loom market crash come true. on contrary – thehousing market get initial scare recover back new highs. towardsautumn, new house sale already exceed average rate several previous years. andtoday, hear voice discuss new record number transaction housingmarket.what reason behind resilience house market? we certainanswers, yet complete and, probably, definitive. i therefore eagerlylooking forward today’s discussion and, order kick-start them, i provide severalpossible explanations.first, i would like mention positive demographic changes, particularly vilnius – capitalcity. in 2019, still doubt whether growth lithuania’s population one-offphenomenon. this year, however, become apparent: country’s population growingfor second consecutive year, trend likely continue, turn substantialimpetus house market growth.moreover, vilnius continue witness rapid expansion financial service providers, it andfinancial technology enterprises, well increase number relatively high-incomebuyers tenant require high-quality housing. robust demand lift capitalcity’s house market current high lead increase office space supply.another reason would record-high house affordability. let’s take simple example: thisyear, typical household acquire mid-sized apartment lithuania three years’wage. so let’s compare: last year, average household work one half monthslonger purchase property, five year ago – ten month longer. of course, takesmore year vilnius. however, general trend obvious: wage growth continue outpacehouse prices, credit term remain favourable. this determined, among things, 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech decisive response covid-19 crisis eurosystem, bank lithuaniais part of: timely decision monetary policy stimulus measure imply interest rate areset remain low quite long time come.dear colleagues,despite pandemic, bank lithuania expert change house marketassessment: even though level activity segment still historically high, currentsituation remain sustainable.what basis assessment?first, i already mentioned, house remain affordable.second, bank lithuania ensure sustainability market financial institutionsthrough macroprudential policy instruments. the responsible lend regulation crackdown irresponsible behaviour homebuyers lenders, help avoid unfounded expectationsand offer real reason believe “that time everything actually different”. indeed, theproportion mortgage house purchase much small onset theglobal financial crisis, whereas growth house loan remain much balance withthe development domestic economy.furthermore, closely monitor happen nationwide, also thelevel individual city regions. if regional house market imbalance emerge, nothesitate take additional step implement bank lithuania’s macroprudentialmandate. for example, necessary, may adjust application responsible lendingregulations acquisition real estate register certain area. we also hope nextyear, along transposition update capital requirement directive, arsenal willbe complement possibility impose additional sectoral capital requirement forcommercial banks. they would allow increase capital requirement separate loan type –for instance, purchase house register particular city.and finally: nature economy love balance or, words, one’s misfortune canturn another’s find. in case, also cannot rule current healthemergency may give impetus house market respect. for instance, anincrease remote work give rise need separate work space, mayencourage household look spacious homes, save make due restrictionson travel leisure may encourage investment housing.i understand consideration may sound overly optimistic reassuring, thus i wouldlike add warning: yet time pop champagne cork. we secondlockdown, may last one. this time, forecast fallout economy and,simultaneously, real estate market definitely simple task. meanwhile, is,unfortunately, extremely wide array risk unfold eyes.for example, house market maintain high resilience level? or household beable successfully meet exist liabilities? the pandemic impose economicrestrictions hit catering, accommodation travel-related service particularly hard. it istrue activity account minor share gdp, comprise le 2%. however,these sector typically employ young staff age 18 35. and young people whoare active homebuyers tenants.dear all,the commercial real estate market show sign uncertainty even secondlockdown. and recent trend indicate outlook segment remain uncertain. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech the pandemic may tilt scale benefit house market, yet implication thecommercial real estate market often opposite. for instance, vacancy rate officespace vilnius project increase substantially next year, certainly mostlydetermined shift remote work.moreover, pandemic disrupt brick-and-mortar trade accelerate shift towardselectronic commerce, add pressure part commercial real estatemarket. for instance, rental income certain shop centre fell nearly one-third thesecond quarter year. limit data available third quarter suggest partially liftedmovement restriction also bring rental income commercial property back itsprevious level. nonetheless, look like commercial sector set undergo significantchanges, require adequate preparation realistic assessment future prospects.hence, commercial real estate market face serious challenges, become evenmore daunt current situation lead structural break evolve “a new normal” inthe post-pandemic world.the situation real estate developer construction enterprise also far fromunambiguous. it true financial performance construction company remain sustainable,the exist stock liquid asset much large previous crisis, debtlevel much lower. however, problem sector particularly vulnerable tointernal external shock due pro-cyclicality. let explain i mean.the global economy obviously go big shock since world war ii. growthforecasts world’s major economy indicate rapid recovery, global tradehas slow down. all mean lithuania’s economic growth near future shouldalso sluggish become use to. look back previouscrisis, memory yet fade away, state construction sectoris usually among first feel effect economic deterioration.therefore, necessary think several step ahead, duly ass risk take build upsufficient buff inevitable contingency order adequately adapt changingsituation real estate market. this imply careful preparation potential developments.dear viewer listeners,as much concern current issues, cannot forget risk havebuilt pandemic relevant segment real estate market. today,these risk observe assess particular care.first all, i would like mention demography. lithuania’s population ageing, despitenoticeable improvement country’s migratory balance. the european commission’sestimates continue show share people age 18 35 country’spopulation decrease approximately one-fifth decade’s time. if demographic trendsremain intact, inevitably significant and, unfortunately, adverse consequence forthe entire lithuanian economy, include real estate market. another important factor isaccess credit.another important factor access credit.this year, continue observe trend year-on-year decrease new bank loan thereal estate sector. approximately half construction company survey bank oflithuania report loan refinance application rejected, thehighest share rejection compare sectors. access finance real estatedevelopers far encourage too, one three application rejected. 3 / 4bis central bankers' speech financial market participant engage lend business admit that, far real estatedevelopers concerned, tight curb apply lend accommodationand public cater enterprises, take severe hit pandemic. financialinstitutions likely hedge pandemic-induced uncertainty far-reaching ambition customers. however, sudden fund cut may entail additional risksfor builder developers.therefore, particularly important fund source real estate undertake andconstruction company grow range diversity. and already see happen –businesses increasingly tap sources, non-financial corporations, non-bankingfinancial institution funds.dear colleagues,our today’s event good opportunity ass potential fallout pandemic thereal estate market, discus challenge currently emerge appear thenear future, well potential preventive measure reduce likely imbalances.by join conference, confirm interest real estate marketenvironment look credible information well-founded answers. we aim samegoal. i much hope eighth conference successful previous

whichthe economy changed, similar significant event occur throughout humanhistory.in regard, i choose speak today important area undergoingprofound change: financial innovation. the change economic

overseas economy i would like begin speech talk overseas economies. overseas economy pick state significant depression. specifically, growth rate april-june quarter 2020 substantially negative many economy implement measure lockdown response spread novel coronavirus (covid-19), mainly europe unite states. however, growth rate economy july-september quarter turn significantly positive, partly reflect materialization pent-up demand effect recovery production decline bring covid-19, amid resumption economic activity. a outlook, overseas economy likely continue improving, partly support aggressive macroeconomic policy take country region, impact covid-19 wan gradually. however, pace improvement expect moderate. this many country region project experience negative growth 2020, give europe unite state currently face serious resurgence infectious cases, also firm household likely remain vigilant risk infection effective medicine vaccine develop widely distribute (chart 1). b. recent development japan's economy base aforementioned development overseas economies, let move economic activity price japan. japan's economy pick economic activity resuming, although remain severe situation due impact covid-19 home abroad. in april-june quarter 2020 -- period affect spread covid-19 state emergency place -- real gdp growth rate register largest-ever decline since 1980, comparable data available, mark minus 8.2 percent quarter-on-quarter basis; however, growth rate july-september quarter turn positive economic activity resume home abroad (chart 2). 2 export increase pick-up overseas economies. especially respect export automobile-related goods, recovery automobile sale unite states, europe, china positive spillover effect production parts, materials, goods. regard it-related exports, firm development see part data center relate personal computers, associate teleworking. furthermore, export capital goods, decline amid global postponement business fix investment, bottom recently. private consumption pick gradually whole. that said, difference speed recovery consumption good services. durable good household electrical appliance automobile partly buoy government's provision special cash payment individual live japan pent-up demand, nondurable good food daily necessity remain firm back expansion stay-at-home consumption. by contrast, consumption services, eat drink well accommodations, remain low level, although head toward pick-up bottom hit april-may period, state emergency place. despite demand stimulus measure "go to" campaign yield hopeful sign since autumn, primarily eat drink well accommodations, covid-19 resurge recently impact warrant concern. with regard outlook, private consumption likely continue pick whole. nevertheless, pace pick-up highly likely remain quite moderate, particularly regard dining-out service individuals, due strong vigilance covid-19, mainly among seniors. a explained, export good consumption recovering. on hand, prolong impact covid-19, especially service eat drink well accommodations, exert downward pressure business fix investment employment income situation. business fix investment decline trend background deterioration corporate profit uncertainty future developments, stem covid-19. this downtrend likely continue time being, mainly term 3 investment construction store accommodation facility eat drink well accommodation industries. that said, software investment remain firm; software investment plan fiscal 2020 bank japan's september tankan (short-term economic survey enterprise japan) revise upward june survey, year-on-year rate increase relatively high levels, mainly communications, information services, retail industry (chart 3). the factor behind likely continue trend since outbreak covid-19 enhance business efficiency undertake labor-saving investment, well firms' active fix investment growth area e-commerce teleworking amid prolong impact pandemic. weakness see employment: diffusion index employment condition show net "excessive" manufacture industry accommodation well eat drink service industry september tankan, decline active job openings-to-applicants ratio, rise unemployment rate (chart 4). moreover, respect wages, non-scheduled cash earn decreased, reflect decline work hours. bonuses, lag behind corporate profit half year, expect weak winter. c. recent price development let elaborate price development japan. the year-on-year rate change consumer price index (cpi) item le fresh food, core cpi, recently decelerated, register minus 0.7 percent october (chart 5). factor contribute decline cpi include past decline crude oil prices, downturn charge hotel package tour overseas, deceleration rate increase price food product sensitive economic activity, decline price clothing. contribute factor also include decrease hotel charge reflect discount offer "go to travel" campaign dissipation upward pressure price generate consumption tax hike 2019. from macroeconomic perspective, output gap, indicate supply-demand balance, decline substantially april-june quarter 2020. subsequently, likely head toward pick-up, mainly manufacture industry. however, gap expect register relatively large negative 4 figure, impact covid-19 exert downward pressure work hour capital utilization rate nonmanufacturing industry (chart 6). in circumstances, medium- long-term inflation expectations, represent perception firm household regard future prices, weaken somewhat (chart 7). on hand, price cut aim stimulate demand observe widely. this cut price cannot expect boost demand primary cause decrease demand consumers' vigilance covid-19, case face-to-face services. another reason firm find difficult make price cut would lead deterioration profits, give current public health necessity limit customer number avoid crowding. d. outlook economic activity japan with economic activity resume impact covid-19 wan gradually, japan's economy likely continue improve trend, support accommodative financial condition government's economic measures. however, pace recovery expect moderate firm household remain vigilant covid-19 continue worldwide impact. thereafter, impact subside globally, economy project keep improve overseas economy return steady growth path. give factors, bank's october 2020 outlook economic activity price (outlook report), forecast majority policy board member real gdp growth rate range minus 5.6 minus 5.3 percent, 3.0 3.8 percent, 1.5 1.8 percent fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively (chart 8). e. outlook price next, i touch outlook prices. in october outlook report, forecast majority policy board member year-on-year rate change core cpi range minus 0.7 minus 0.5 percent, 0.2 0.6 percent, 0.4 0.7 percent fiscal 2020, 2021, 2022, respectively (chart 8). the background forecast follows. 5 first, i mention earlier, covid-19 affect price item energy travel-related service short run. price item sensitive economic activity, food products, durable goods, clothing, dining-out, also highly likely come gradual downward pressure. furthermore, mobile phone-related price project continue show weakness, reflect price-setting stance major carrier competitiveness industry. nevertheless, due course, movement toward price rise expect resume impact covid-19 wan japan's economy improving. in words, downward pressure decline crude oil price "go to travel" campaign dissipate, upward pressure price good service sensitive economic activity gradually heighten along improvement output gap. against background, medium- long-term inflation expectation also expect rise again. f. risk economic activity price however, outlook economic activity price remain extremely unclear. in particular, impact covid-19 domestic overseas economy continue require close careful monitoring. until effective medicine vaccine develop widely distributed, highly unclear covid-19 pandemic evolve long take subside. it also uncertain firms' households' behavior, include price setting, change struggle live covid-19. moreover, covid-19 large impact expected, risk deterioration real economy affect financial system stability, thereby exert downward pressure real economy. ii. conduct monetary policy a. enhancement monetary ease light impact covid-19 let turn bank's policy conduct. with covid-19 spread worldwide, global financial capital market unstable, financial condition become le accommodative term corporate financing, see deterioration firms' financial position due decline sale 6 profits. give developments, bank enhance monetary ease since march implement follow three measure view support corporate finance maintain stability financial market (chart 9). the first measure special program support finance response novel coronavirus (covid-19). this program consist bank's purchase cp corporate bond within 20 trillion yen introduction funds-supplying operation 120 trillion yen encourage lend financial institutions. the latter include scheme government take credit risk lend financial institution small medium-sized firm bank provide fund financial institution favorable terms. the second measure ample provision yen foreign currency funds. the bank decide purchase necessary amount japanese government bond (jgbs) without limit, view maintain stability bond market stabilize entire yield curve low level. it also decide provide large amount u.s. dollar fund base cooperation five major central banks. the third measure active purchase exchange-traded fund (etfs) japan real estate investment trust (j-reits). the aim prevent firms' households' sentiment deteriorate volatility financial markets, thereby support positive economic activity. the bank ass three measure function effectively. specifically, tension financial market eased, although still nervous. in addition, despite weakness financial position firms, environment external funding, bank borrow issuance cp corporate bonds, remain accommodative, partly owe private financial institution actively fulfil function financial intermediation. 7 b. quantitative qualitative monetary ease (qqe) yield curve control while bank enhance monetary ease light impact covid-19, i outlined, pursue powerful monetary ease seven half year since introduction qqe 2013. under powerful monetary easing, view achieve price stability target 2 percent, bank make clear intention continue qqe yield curve control, long necessary maintain target stable manner. control short- long-term interest rate -- so-called yield curve control -- facilitate formation term structure interest rate appropriate achieve price stability target. specifically, bank apply negative interest rate minus 0.1 percent portion financial institutions' current account balance bank, purchase jgbs 10-year jgb yield remain around 0 percent (chart 10). a result resolutely continue powerful monetary easing, japan's economy continued, around 2019, expand trend virtuous cycle income spend operating. a prices, underlie trend year-on-year rate change cpi le fresh food energy generally positive territory seven years. unfortunately, however, momentum toward achieve price stability target lose temporarily due covid-19, thus assume monetary ease prolong further. iii. monetary policy prospect further prolongation low interest rate a explained, positive effect bank's powerful monetary ease measure materialize prolong low interest rate environment. on hand, although seven half year pass since bank introduce qqe, project rate increase core cpi fiscal 2022 still 0.7 percent, far target. it therefore certain monetary ease prolong further. it likely take time price rise, part negative output gap exert downward pressure price time being, medium- long-term inflation expectation weaken somewhat adaptive expectation formation mechanism rate change cpi expect negative. in addition these, i pay close attention three factor standpoint general public. 8 a. potential factor constrain price rise the first factor concern wages. accord announcement japanese trade union confederation (rengo), base pay rise seventh consecutive year annual spring labor-management wage negotiation 2020. however, average rate increase seven year around 0.5 percent, marginal term price stability target. unfortunately, give deterioration corporate profit bring impact covid-19, seem unlikely pace increase wage boost momentum fiscal 2021. in addition, partly winter bonus expect weak, i mention earlier, wage likely remain downward pressure time being. furthermore, increase number firm start replace seniority-based wage system merit-based systems, pursue great labor mobility initiative shift lifetime employment job-based employment. these trend desirable necessary medium long term firm japan's economy increase productivity. on hand, concern average wage propensity consume may negatively affect gradual loss wage employment system enable worker feel wage steadily rise line number year worked. the second factor decline land prices. look price july 1 representative locations, release september, year-on-year rate change nationwide average turn decline first time three years, register minus 0.6 percent. this likely due sharp drop number visitor japan voluntary stay-at-home behavior, result impact covid-19. since land, relative stocks, large term total asset value term proportion hold individuals, concern decline land price affect consumer sentiment. the third impact future sentiment many consumer face unforeseen decline income. since outbreak covid-19, concern public pension fund -- namely, whether provide adequate benefit -- likely constrain consumption among young middle-aged generations. for seniors, constrain factor say "longevity risk," words, risk save insufficient cover rise healthcare expenditure live expense live long 9 expected. in wake covid-19, another potential factor constrain consumption arise -- is, risk future income decline unexpectedly due incident spread pandemic. there concern might raise households' propensity save downward pressure consumption might exert accordingly. b. sustainability flexibility monetary ease give expect take time achieve price stability target, due part impact covid-19, i think become even important monetary ease measure sustainable flexible. let share think this. stability financial system indispensable monetary ease measure sustain impact. i repeatedly stress view particularly important aim achieve price stability financial system stability conduct monetary policy. this because, global financial crisis (gfc) revealed, financial system destabilizes, extremely difficult bank ensure price stability, result failure meet objectives. smooth function financial intermediation far ensure due financial institutions' robust financial bases, term capital liquidity, well policy response bank government. however, institutions' financial soundness deteriorate due fall lend rate increase credit costs, smooth function financial intermediation could impaired, pose risk downward pressure exert real economy. on point, financial institutions' lend rate extremely low levels, partly reflect intensify competition among institutions, situation demand new loan limit due decline population number firm across regions, low interest rate environment prolonged. in addition, attention pay point program interest-free unsecured loan currently implement support corporate finance might exert downward pressure spread regular loan make without support program, even impact covid-19 subsides. 10 credit cost could increase, financial institution provide active support firm whose financial position deteriorate due covid-19, certain proportion loan could become nonperforming. so far, increase credit cost seem serious observe gfc; however, covid-19 may protract impact corporate sale profits, attention continue pay future developments. furthermore, even since outbreak covid-19, financial institution actively extend loan firm relatively high credit risk invest high-risk overseas assets, narrow lend margin decline jgb yield prolong monetary easing. this may another risk factor outlook. under circumstances, development super-long-term interest rate key maintain stability financial institutions' financial conditions. specifically, financial institution raise fund mean deposit take bank's operations, invest funds, mainly lend jgb purchases. in so, raise fund short term invest long term; words, difference maturity fund investment basic revenue source institutions. while somewhat technical, concept asset liability management, difference represent interest rate risk, bank gain profit take risk. while financial institution increase lending, seem strong incentive hold long-term jgbs since share loan long-term fix interest rate generally large. one objective behind bank's introduction yield curve control prevent excessive flatten yield curve, might raise concern sustainability financial function broad sense exert adverse effect consumer sentiment, mainly limit investment opportunity term pension insurance products. super-long-term interest rate rise six month follow introduction yield curve control, recently slightly low level time. it desirable yield curve super-long-term jgbs become steep moderate pace bank keep 10-year jgb yield around 0 percent, financial institution improve profit investment bank achieve financial system stability monetary ease prolonged. 11 next, i would like talk sustainability flexibility etf j-reit purchases. a one component policy framework achieve price stability target, bank purchase asset exert positive influence economic activity price low risk premia stock reit markets. such asset purchase prove effective support firms' households' positive economic activity prevent sentiment deteriorating, mainly volatility financial markets. a i explain earlier, etf j-reit purchase play major role, particularly financial market become unstable due impact covid-19. moreover, necessary continue purchase situation achieve price stability target likely take time. give monetary ease expect prolong due part impact covid-19, bank look additional way enhance sustainability flexibility policy measure face difficulty conduct etf j-reit purchase appropriate low risk premia asset price absolutely necessary. c. raise japan's economic growth rate a outlined, i think become increasingly important enhance sustainability flexibility bank's policy measure give prospect prolong monetary easing. at time, however, boost japan's growth potential also essential achieve price stability target. in regard, society firm make effort raise economic growth rate realize growth strategy thereby bring change economic structure, become vital consider monetary policy contribute efforts. a japan's economy process recover downturn cause impact covid-19, essential, time being, government bank support sustain firms' business employment various measures. however, could case le productive business continue operate even inefficient firm would otherwise shut remain business. this may induce side effect whereby japan's productivity growth weigh long term. therefore, i think become important society move toward promote development 12 digitalization great labor mobility, firm allocate capital highly productive business area base sound growth strategies. even prior outbreak covid-19, secular decline potential growth rate major issue japan, face structural problem decline age population. although japan's economy suffer serious blow pandemic, growth business compatible new lifestyle take consideration infection prevention, teleworking rapidly become widespread. against background, digitalization gain momentum. from medium- long-term perspective, factor likely act drive force shift japan's economy toward achieve high growth rate. for time being, bank need utmost conduct monetary policy view support financing, mainly firms, maintain stability financial markets. however, medium- long-term perspective, also important bank support financial side effort society firm push forward structural reform growth strategies. in so, course essential bank maintain accommodative financial conditions, thereby continue provide solid foundation firm take risk pursue change. at time, i think also important encourage firms' investment growth areas, mainly financial institutions' expertise examine creditworthiness firm market mechanism, potential growth rate rise accordingly. thank attention. economic activity, prices, monetary policy japandecember 3, 2020suzuki hitoshibank japanspeech meet local leadersin fukushima (via

and means,as speaker mentioned, secure emergence long-term money.my deputy, sergey shvetsov, today tell financial market agenda.in open remarks, i would like expand number key point operationsas

thesewelcome developments, central focus remain real target, makehousing available people, stage kind race records. our housingmarket indeed lot growth potential: true mortgage lend yet becomeas

central bankers' speech i would like thank stéphane lavoie, jam macgee jonathan witmer help prepare speech. not publication december 10, 2020 1:30 pm eastern time remark paul beaudry deputy governor fredericton, new brunswick, moncton, new brunswick, saint john, new brunswick december 10, 2020 deliver virtually our quantitative ease operations: look hood introduction good afternoon thank much kind introduction, john. i’m really please opportunity talk today—even virtually opposite coasts. i’m resident canada’s west coast, i hold fond memory time spend vacation maritimes home town québec. a know, bank make decision yesterday maintain target overnight rate 0.25 percent, we’ll spend time discuss later. but first, i want talk action address covid-19 immense challenge pandemic pose financial well-being canadians. since pandemic hit march, take swift decisive action help canadian household business bridge short-term crisis. but also concern provide strong foundation longer-term recovery. in face pandemic, low policy interest rate 0.25 percent ensure low borrow cost household businesses. we commit maintain policy rate current level inflation objective achieved. we also launch nearly dozen liquidity facility asset purchase program keep market function credit flow well allow interest rate cut work way economy. - 2 - today, i’ll discus main large-scale asset purchase program—the government canada bond purchase program1—in great detail. we commonly refer program quantitative easing. what’s important remember program ground policy framework serve canada well years. each action design return economy toward full capacity support 2 percent inflation target. with mind, i would like clarify mechanic potential misinterpretation quantitative easing—or qe—program. when conduct qe, bank purchase bond secondary market previously issue government canada. this program expand balance sheet, generate considerable attention concern. the common question get are: how buy assets? how pay them? be finance federal government’s debt? and, danger ignite high inflation process? so let’s take time talk qe: does, doesn’t do, works. because monetary policy work best it’s well understood. what quantitative ease a i mentioned, bank’s primary monetary policy goal achieve 2 percent inflation target sustainable basis. to that, strive keep economy’s production close capacity possible. this particularly important time like these, inflation well target unemployment high. our policy interest rate overnight rate. it main policy tool normal times. the overnight rate direct impact cost borrow short terms. increase decrease policy rate also shape market’s expectation future overnight rates. in turn, affect longer-term borrow lend rates. through channel, bank influence cost credit canadian household businesses. this influence spend investment decisions—and, ultimately, inflation. but policy rate isn’t way affect longer-term interest rate matter canadians. when long reduce policy rate, need dig deep tool kit want stimulate economy. one important instrument extend tool kit qe, let begin explain qe affect interest rates. when bank buy government bond give maturity, bid price. this, turn, low rate interest bond pay holders. when interest rate government bond lower, transmit interest rates, 1 for information, see bank’s government canada bond purchase program web page. - 3 - mortgage corporate loans. this stimulate borrow spending, help inflation move close 2 percent inflation target. so, see, even overnight rate long reduced, bank still affect longer-term interest rate use qe. how quantitative ease work let’s turn attention mechanic qe. every week, government canada sell bond financial institutions—mostly commercial banks—that approve participate auctions. under qe, bank buy bond auction participants, directly government. the bank conduct qe operation reverse auction. when think auction, probably imagine someone sell goods, people bid purchase them. when conduct qe, call reverse auction it’s opposite: hold auction buy—not sell—government bonds. we announce intention buy certain quantity bond give day. we receive offer market participant wish sell u bond hold. the bid process competitive, typically receive many offer sell will buy. this good mean purchase bond offer low price. we currently buy minimum $4 billion week bond process. overall, purchase slightly $180 billion since program launch march. that’s big number. and it’s true qe program asset purchase lead substantial increase bank’s balance sheet. but despite purchase we’ve made, worth note value asset hold size canadian economy remain relatively low international standards—roughly two-thirds bank england u federal reserve (chart 1). - 4 - chart 1: the bank canada’s balance sheet remain relatively low sources: bank canada, bloomberg finance l.p., national source via haver analytics bank canada calculation last observation: 2020q3 of course, buy bond auction, need pay them. but don’t print new bank note so. rather, pay issue particular form liability. for anyone know basic principle accounting, know balance sheet to, well, balance. the bond purchase become asset us, need liability side pay them. here’s example. if buy $100 million government bond bank a, pay issue call settlement balances. these appear deposit bank canada. just like commercial bank consider deposit liability owe clients, settlement balance liability bank canada owe commercial banks. we pay interest deposit rate, move one-for-one policy interest rate. so recap, perform qe operations, buy government bond financial institution issue liabilities—in form settlement balances—to pay them. it’s important note settlement balance normal part central bank operations. be able issue settlement balance privilege

scale)reserve bank australia (right scale)central bank total asset percentage four-quarter average grossdomestic product, quarterly data - 5 - have. we use ability carefully fulfill mandate promote economic financial welfare canada canadians. question quantitative ease i’ll first admit mechanic quantitative ease hard wrap head around. so i’d like turn attention question i raise earlier—what public official ask u explain qe. the first impression we’re activate print press issue bank note buy government bonds. be print cash? like lot central banks, bank canada move away many year ago set amount cash economy. instead, set overnight interest rate let household business decide much cash need conduct transactions. when conduct qe, i explained, buy government bond pay issue variable interest rate liability form settlement balances. just like anyone else take debt, compensate holder pay interest balances. and policy rate changes, interest rate pay settlement balances. when carry qe, balance sheet expands, number bank note circulation not. be bank finance federal government’s debt? another important point qe release government liabilities. we finance government spend cost, make government’s debt disappear. there big difference finance government influence cost government financing. through qe, bank canada latter—we low cost borrow government. but importantly, low cost borrow everyone economy. to put simply: provide free lunch government. the government repay bond purchase qe program reach maturity. i note qe operation may result profit loss bank difference interest rate borrow cost return government bonds. any profit loss arise qe operation pass government, part regular remittance. however, it’s important state increase revenue primary goal operations. the sole purpose qe reduce cost borrow everyone canada, help people get back work achieve inflation target. will qe cause high inflation? so let’s move third final point clarification. since start qe, i’ve hear read lot risk cause excessive inflation. it true qe - 6 - design increase current low level inflation. that’s whole point—to get u back near 2 percent target. but rest assure overuse qe overshoot 1 3 percent target range inflation. the exit strategy qe program tie inflation goals. we pursue quantitative ease economic recovery well underway. at point three different options. once amount purchase reduced, first option would stabilize level asset balance sheet reinvesting proceed mature asset new ones. this would maintain—but increase—the level stimulus. the second option would allow mature asset roll balance sheet reinvest proceeds. the third option would actively sell assets, thus quickly reduce balance sheet. this option would aggressive reduce level stimulus. several central bank use qe global financial crisis focus first two options, careful sequence. our choice different option would depend outlook evolution inflation. how we’ve do far the good news effort face covid-19 intend effect. financial market function much good begin policy action march. our balance sheet stable since july, largely due reduce use certain program (chart 2). chart 2: the bank canada’s balance sheet size stabilize source: bank canada last observation: october 21, 2020 0100200300400500600janfebmaraprmayjunjulaugsepoctcan$ billlionssecurities purchase resale agreementsgovernment canada bondstreasury billsbankers’ acceptancesall assetsbank canada total assets, weekly data - 7 - and bond purchase recently recalibrated. we adjust qe program focus impact longer-term interest rate matter canadians. we buy few bond short maturity long maturities, benefit canadian household business greater. for example, buy five-year bonds, low five-year lend rate loan household businesses. since recalibration increase impact dollar spend qe program, recently reduce minimum weekly purchase $5 billion $4 billion. all allow u efficient balance sheet, continue provide least much monetary stimulus. yesterday’s decision let conclude spend minute provide context insight policy decision yesterday. we decide maintain level policy interest rate 25 basis point continue asset purchase minimum $4 billion weekly qe program. foremost mind head decision recent development across dimensions—how thing transpire date, thing look near term thing shape out. let briefly discus turn. look back development date, last week’s publication canada’s national account third quarter 2020 confirm expectation sharp rebound would take place economy reopened, follow precipitous decline activity second quarter. indeed, economy grow rapidly, close 9 percent third quarter, bite 10 percent growth expect october monetary policy report (mpr). the overall level economic activity remain largely track expectations, reflect historical revision gross domestic product little momentum head fourth quarter anticipate october. it’s also worth note strong global demand push price commodities, include oil. a second aspect view sharp rebound would give way longer, slow phase economic recovery. we’ve call recuperation phase. and indeed, recent data suggest part view also unfold largely expected. the rise incidence covid-19 case across country tighten restriction activity response exacerbate dynamic. the second wave clearly underway, canada globally. this weigh economic activity first quarter 2021 represent important downside risk out, situation become much worse. a note yesterday’s decision, federal government’s recently announce measure help maintain household business income second wave pandemic support recovery. - 8 - look out, picture reassuring—recent positive news vaccine represent upside risk outlook, although uncertainty remain around roll out, canada globally. so set scene. go forward, downside upside risk inflation play. for bank, mean prepare respond either direction. thankfully, tool so. should thing take persistent turn worse, range option disposal provide additional monetary stimulus. this could include increase stimulus power qe program, could involve target specific point yield curve, otherwise know yield-curve control. it could also include reassess effective low bound, would allow possibility lower—but still positive—policy rate. in theory, negative interest rate remain bank’s tool kit. but we’ve clear that, bar dramatically different set circumstances, don’t think negative rate would productive canadian context. what option respond upside? the fast people get vaccinate people get back work contact-sensitive sectors, quickly recovery could unfold. such outcome would welcome news. in context, may need re-examine amount stimulus need achieve inflation target. early speech, i illustrate could withdraw stimulus qe program time comes. what know today canada’s economic recovery continue require extraordinary monetary policy support. we clear hold policy rate effective low bind economic slack absorbed, 2 percent inflation target sustainably achieved. a october mpr, doesn’t happen 2023. we yet do full analysis new information shift assessment. to reinforce commitment keep interest rate low across yield curve, bank continue qe program recovery well underway adjust require help bring inflation back target sustainable basis. whatever outcome, bank remain commit provide monetary policy stimulus need support recovery achieve inflation objective. guo shuqing: fintech developments, challenge supervisionin chinavideo speech mr guo shuqing, party secretary deputy governor people's bank ofchina cbirc chairman, singapore fintech festival (sff) 2020, 8 december 2020.* * *ladies gentlemen, dear friends,it great pleasure attend singapore fintech fesitval 2020. i would like share thelatest fintech development china observations.first, update fintech development china.over recent years, fintech develop rapidly robustly china. financialinstitutions make continue effort promote digital transformation. financial product toolsbecame diversified, financial service efficient inclusive.with wide coverage e-payment, particular mobile payment, basic financial service nowavailable across whole country. even remote areas, every adult herown bank account. china rank high term coverage volume mobilepayments. this enable real time process deposit, withdrawal remittance. onlineshopping booming, provide convenience daily life.digital credit fundamentally improve financial service micro small enterprises,the self-employed farmers. bank use big data smart risk management, reducedreliance collateral make loan accessible. by end october year, microand small firm bank credit reach 27 million, loan firm self-employed grow 30% year year, loan farmer grow 14.3%.digitalisation remarkably expand insurance’s coverage. in china, basic pension cover 1billion people, basic medical insurance cover 1.3 billion, cross-province fee settlement achieved. by video remote authentication, key part insurancebusiness move online. in first half year, internet life insurance premiumgrew 12.2% year year, internet property insurance companies’ premium grow 44.2%.financial digitalisation make huge contribution poverty alleviation. with multiple digitaltools, financial institution well target fund support poor households. by end ofseptember year, small loan poverty alleviation total 504 billion yuan, benefit 12million households. financial institution also set online platform connect producer withconsumers. through online marketing, credit reference, guarantee payments, thoseplatforms help poor household sell agricultural product everywhere.fintech also strongly support fight covid-19. since outbreak, financialinstitutions rapidly optimize mobile apps on-line services. they provide safeand convenient ‘at home’ financial products, make sure basic financial service remainavailable. many institution offer online fast tracks, greatly enhance service efficiencyand effectiveness, support rapid economic recovery.second, experience lesson fintech.the development laws, rule regulation fintech like “feeling stoneswhile cross river”. we meet someproblems, learn lesson gain experience. here iwould like mention four cases. 1 / 3bis central bankers' speech the first case p2p. it originally suppose information intermediary.however practice, many p2p platform engage lend wealth management. for thepast 14 years, total number p2p 10 thousand china. at peak, wereover 5000 company operate time. the annual trade volume 3 trillionyuan. the npls loss high. by mid-november, operate p2p platformshave close down.the second case third-party payment platforms. in past, third-party paymentcompanies provide investment service customers’ online shop reserve funds. the yieldwas much high bank deposits, money could redeem anytime. therefore, itgreatly rattle bank deposit asset management business. such investment verymuch like money market mutual fund (mmmf) products, unregulated extent.thus, might violate laws, rule even potentially engage money laundering. now, thosepayment company ask deposit reserve fund central bank, therelated investment put supervision.the third case internet financial companies. some tend induce overspendingthrough various scenario over-marketing loan overdraft. they even offer loan tostudents without repayment abilities. when default occurred, pursue coercive loancollection, cause many social problems. hence, insist apply unify regulationby business activities, stand firmly regulatory arbitrage.the fourth case data privacy. some tech company use market advantage toimproperly collect, use even sell user data. without users’ authorization, activitiesseriously violate business interest individual privacy. chinese government make effortsto plug holes. the civil code provide legal protection individual information. the individualinformation protection law also drafted. financial data security regulation beingdeveloped regulators. all aim build effective protection prevent data leakand abuse.third, issue need discussed.facing rapid growth fintech, adopt positive prudent approach. we willencourage innovation enhance risk control, address new problem andchallenges.firstly, pay high attention cyber security. at present, 90% china’s bankingtransactions move online. compare conventional risks, cyber risk spread fasterand wide impact greater. cyber security emergency also call good contingencyresponse management.secondly, promote fair market competition. fintech “winner take all” industry. with theadvantage data monopoly, bigtech firm tend hind fair competition seek excessprofits. traditional anti-monopoly law focus cartel, market abuse operator concentration.however, fintech industry lead many new phenomenon problems. we might need paymore attention follow questions.a) have bigtech firm block newcomers;b) collect data improperly;c) refuse disclose information make public;d) engage conduct mislead user consumers?thirdly, watch “too big fail”. now mircropayment market dominate 2 / 3bis central bankers' speech tech companies. they feature key financial infrastructure publicinterest stake. besides, bigtechs operate cross-sector businesses, financial andtechnology activity one roof. it necessary closely follow spillover thosecomplex risks, take timely target measure prevent new systemic risks.fourthly, clarify data ownership. chinese government recognize data productionfactor together labor, capital technology. and clear ownership fundamental market-based allocation price data. at present, jurisdiction specify ownership ofdata property, bigtechs de facto control data. it necessary clarify data rightsof different party soon, improve data flow price mechanism. it also important tofully fairly utilize data, protect lawful interest players.fifthly, strengthen international coordination cross-border data flow. china recently putforward global data security initiative, call respect sovereignty, jurisdiction datasecurity management rights. it basic principle balance development security. and wewill enhance cross-border coordination jointly promote open, fair non-discriminatory business environment.ladies gentlemen,the boom digital economy connect u closely ever before. let’s join handstogether promote healthy development fintech.to conclude, i wish event great success. and wish good health.thank you!

longrun.the first challenge ensure sustainability ongoing recovery safeguard itagainst downside risks, potential second lockdown.at bank albania believe overall policy stance remain accommodative overthe foreseeable future. any policy normalization coordinate data-dependent. acoordinated normalization mean ideal sequence macroprudential policy stance first,followed fiscal monetary policy later. a data-dependent normalization meanspolicymakers need see tangible evidence solid recovery, prior policy tightening. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech give fragile recovery policymakers would best advise lean side caution.faced additional shocks, believe priority offer additional accommodationto economy. however, policy maker careful get policy mix right thatpotential long-term cost outweigh short term benefits. to extent, believe:fiscal policy provide additional support, subject exist fiscal space. so far, publicsector sin develop economy little finance constraints, partly account ofmassive injection liquidity central banks. the appear true also theemerging market economies, albania, continue enjoy market access andrelatively low finance costs. however, fiscal authority emerge market economiesshould mindful need preserve market credibility sustainability finances.financial intermediary – bank – also share fair share burden.they would naturally absorb large part

southeastern european (cesee) region since transformation recession almost three decade ago. accord late imf outlook, real gdp three cesee subregions, eu member states, western balkan russia, decline around 5% 2020. the gradual spread pandemic eastern europe spring 2020 swift response local authority prevent major spike infection number similar see many southern western european countries. this enable cesee region start lift restriction public life economy comparatively early stage. a result, imf expect small contraction region euro area. in projection six cesee eu member states, oenb expect downturn similar forecast imf 2020, protract recovery 2021 2022. this forecast subject substantial downside risk stem uncertainty concern spread coronavirus. unique features: health crisis truly global scope the current crisis two unique feature distinguish precede crisis past decades: start health crisis, immediately morph economic crisis, seem unprecedented term global coverage, simultaneity economic severity. let first elaborate first distinguish feature: the stringent containment measure response health crisis set grind major economic downturn. the current surge infection numbers, especially many country cesee region, bode well change crisis response near future: we may see stringent containment measure winter, already witness czech republic slovakia. thus, substantial downside risk are, part, already materializing. this aggravate economic burden. let move second distinguish feature: the crisis truly global nature. hence, confront simultaneous shock domestic external demand. in addition, unprecedented degree uncertainty weigh negatively consumption investment. a result, especially small, open strongly integrate economy – like cesee country – highly vulnerable economic terms. before relate two feature topic year’s conference, let briefly review recent economic development cesee region. large recession since early 1990s in second quarter 2020, several cesee country report large quarterly decline economic activity since early year transition 1990s. despite depth gdp decline second quarter 2020, cesee region still report benign real gdp decline figure euro area (–7.3% compare –11.8%, quarter quarter). the summer month allow breather; however, swift economic recovery likely short-lived. this is, least, indicate recent read activity well sentiment indicators. against background rapidly rise infection numbers, improvement indicator stall past week (schreiner et al., 2020). economic policy come rescue the cesee country deploy rather large fiscal packages, include i.a. tax cuts, wage subsidy short-time work schemes. at maximum usage, scheme covered, example, page 3 von 8 15% workforce slovenia slovakia, 20% romania one-third croatia. of course, size fiscal package vary accord fiscal space available. monetary policy react well. in several country quantitative ease via outright government bond purchase emerge important pillar monetary policy. moreover, macroprudential measure adopt cushion impact crisis bank borrowers. the cesee country also introduce moratorium play important role administer – metaphorically speak – first aid. since moratorium provide temporary relief, since extend good targeted. however, domestic policy come rescue, also international cooperation liquidity support negotiate timely manner international financial institutions, imf ebrd, well ecb. regard latter, let draw attention liquidity arrangement ecb cesee countries, include bilateral swap repo line newly establish precautionary backstop facility eurep. a case point, ecb agree new swap line bulgaria croatia spring early summer, new repo line albania, hungary, north macedonia, romania serbia. this support help stabilize international capital flow countries. the global nature crisis impact cesee via gvcs policy spillover after brief review recent economic development cesee region, let come back second distinguish feature current crisis – global nature. this bring directly year’s ceei address topic “cesee covid-19 crisis – role eu global spillovers.” in context, i would like focus three issues: i) role global value chain (gvcs); ii) role monetary policy spillovers; iii) role eu funds. 1. the role gvcs first, cesee country among country high degree economic integration trade, foreign direct investment (fdi) financial linkages. together germany, many cesee economy form backbone european manufacture strong focus follow industries: transport equipment, electronic equipment, metallurgy, machinery chemicals. this central role within globally important value chain often consider stabilize factor two reasons: i) fdi important determinant production integration, ii) trade relation gvcs rather stable. a difficult find right producer highly specialize tailor-made solution deliver time specific value chains, trade relationship gvcs imply large sink cost established. this also mean case external shocks, volume trade adjust flexible manner trade relationship within value chain maintained. this dominance adjustment intensive margin trade rather extensive margin support stability. furthermore, gvc integration often imply external fund fdi; words, gvcs rely rather stable form external funding. yet, current global crisis, supply disruption occur begin crisis. meanwhile, major problem result weak global demand final goods, pose challenge deeply integrate cesee economies. page 4 von 8 2. the role monetary policy spillover second, ecb’s monetary policy response pandemic renew interest monetary policy spillover whether beneficial spillover-receiving countries. while u monetary policy main driver global financial cycle, cesee country seem strongly affect monetary spillover euro area, cesee region strongly integrate euro area trade financial flows, particularly cross-border bank flows. we discus issue extensively session 1 panel 1 today, let briefly mention empirical evidence point strong spillovers. oenb research show monetary ease euro area positive effect output, also consumer equity price cesee region (feldkircher schuberth, 2020). this line empirical study topic (colabella, 2020; horváth voslářová, 2017; potjagailo, 2017). in cases, even report amplification effect second-round effect (feldkircher, 2015; feldkircher schuberth, 2020) positively influence output trade partner well. some author also find output spillover relatively strong price spillover compare relative strength output versus price effect euro area (benecká et al., 2018; moder, 2019). these effect transmit different channels: via demand, exchange rate financial linkage (feldkircher et al., 2020). a thorough understand spillover effect thus crucial design appropriate domestic monetary, also macroprudential, policy ideally allow economy reap benefit strong economic financial integration euro area, mitigate associate risks. i look forward discuss issue esteem colleague late panel 1. 3. the role eu fund third, let turn role eu funds. a immediate response, eu authority provide emergency support finance ease certain requirements, national -financing requirements, tap available cohesion structural fund year’s eu budget. in parallel, flexibility clause fiscal framework activate state aid rule temporarily adjusted. a next step, european parliament council agree eur 100 billion sure instrument propose european commission. sure stand “support mitigate unemployment risk emergency.” base eu budget capital market borrowing, sure instrument provide loan individual member state support short-time work scheme help member state protect job thus employee self-employed risk unemployment. the first bond issuance program substantially oversubscribed consider success. the council already approve financial support sure several member states. romania, example, receive eur 4 billion, poland receive eur 11 billion. pursuant invitation european council view support common broad-based recovery within eu, european commission complement previous budgetary proposal next multiannual financial framework (mff) period 2021 2027 “recovery package” end may. accord council, fund european union recovery instrument refer “next generation eu” (ngeu) page 5 von 8 design commit period 2021 2023 pay end-2026. the negotiation european parliament council presidency european union recovery instrument ongoing since end august, parallel negotiation proposal mff already table back 2018. a usual, nothing agree everything agree – i convince side negotiation table well aware great responsibility current situation. at barely 1% eu gross national income (gni), eu budget tiny. therefore, national sovereign borrow continue bear brunt fiscal deficit finance eu member states. still, simultaneous investment stimulus provide eu recovery fund come year expect substantial highly welcome. even so, eu country below-average per caput income, i.e. cesee eu member state particular, among large beneficiaries. let zoom recovery resilience facility (rff), large program european union recovery instrument. the rff particularly aim foster cohesion upward convergence improve resilience growth potential well support green digital transitions. in order receive support rff, eu member state submit national recovery resilience plans. each plan dedicate minimum 37% expenditure climate-related (green) investment minimum 20% expenditure digital investment (on infrastructure capacities). while target clearly set, may somewhat conditionality need reach goal state earlier, especially respect support green transition. i come back conclusions. do crisis change way thinking? it early judge whether covid-19 crisis last impact economic policymaking. yet, crisis certainly put spotlight powerful effect economic policy have. the direct macroeconomic support observe past six month impressive. let elaborate one issue context, address tomorrow detail: view globalization attitude toward global value chains. the covid-19 crisis lead mark increase demand specific goods, e.g. health product it equipment. these good produce highly organize global value chains. yet, time, crisis also lead interruption supply chain due restriction transport labor mobility. this situation exacerbate export ban quantity restrictions. world trade organization (wto) estimate suggest around 20% global export protective clothe 17% disinfectant export affected. in light examples, crisis call different view global value chains? the covid-19 crisis may “game changer” respect, reinforce trend observe quite time. the expansion global value chain slow since mid-2000s, trend intensify global financial crisis. so far, however, cannot speak shorten even dismantle global value chains. after all, rather swift revival global value chain follow ease restriction demonstrate stability potential support recovery. certainly, current page 6 von 8 crisis hold lessons: promote efficient, also robust resilient global value chain future. for example, build-up safety stock essential good could provide sufficient buff even though require careful balance benefit costs. upstream bottleneck identify avoid broaden supplier base. government support smooth function global value chain facilitate smooth flow good service support substitutability input harmonize norm standards. in lieu conclusions: imminent reform priority let end draw attention press priorities. in near term – depend spread pandemic – main challenge use policy space efficient way mitigate economic impact health crisis need implement indispensable health policy containment measures. this do make use monetary, fiscal macroprudential policy put quality quantity. at time, sizeable structural challenge face economy tackle well. in context, i would like mention two reform priorities: digital transformation green transformation. with respect digital transformation, current crisis possibly act catalyst. this is, inter alia, evidence simple fact meet virtually first time ceei’s history. in context global value chains, focus put digitalization. policy support information communication technology (ict) intensity global value chain thus make resilient future shocks. regulatory framework innovation, digitalization cross-border capital flow key enable sound business environment support economic recovery also productivity growth long run. the strategic forward-looking position eu firm regional global production network support policy link capital market development digital single market. another eminent issue green transformation. the move toward green economy imply wide range decision taken. for example, question carbon emission price respective taxation – domestically form border adjustment mechanism – must addressed. measure avoid deal strand asset must considered. moreover, addition promote green technologies, certainly need regulation limit eliminate brown technologies. the latter still prevalent transportation sector, need reduce individual motorize travel large extent. in regard, let end remark briefly comment european railway system: with 26% global network railways, europe exhibit second large railway infrastructure base operate length america (accounting 37%). a aside, predecessor current dominant carrier austria, oebb, k.k. staatsbahnen austro-hungarian empire. the k.k. staatsbahnen result emergency nationalization 1884 follow economic crisis ten year earlier. many private carrier new technology economic difficulty takeover state imply shift policy paradigm. already 150 year ago, crisis act catalyst. yet, european railway network far seamless. give huge technical structural heterogeneity prevail european railway network, need strong page 7 von 8 coordinate policy support leap 19th century heritage single european railway area fit 21st century. such effort focus significant investment intelligent railway infrastructure overcome difference gauges, signal voltage system ensure interoperability connectivity throughout europe. moreover, need investment safety reliability railway system allow autonomous monitor smart maintenance without cause disruptions. a truly integrate european railway system would allow cargo container send south italy north sweden, finland portugal, within 24 hours, within week. it would also allow cargo truck operate within 50 km radius home, within 500 km 1,000 km radius. thus, need investment optimize modal split transportation. in context, let mention eu budget connect europe facility provide welcome contribution tackle common challenge europe. i choose european railway system one example, i sure many example find demonstrate innovative way come crisis. another important challenge handle unavoidable increase public debt implication (the conduct of) monetary policy. the ecb’s monetary policy hugely supportive, effect extend beyond euro area. i look forward discuss issue today tomorrow! to kick-start discussions, please highly renowned keynote speaker join u today. i pleasure welcome introduce marcel fratzscher. marcel fratzscher economist, author columnist. he

kaliningrad regionor video conferencing — format become quite common now. i hope meetingis attend large number participants. indeed, i listen attentively i thinkthat approach kaliningrad region pursue develop small medium-sizedbusinesses promise comprehensive. however, well aware thata lot project depend accessible fund — would impossible implementa project access funding.today’s meet important me: although bank russia influence economythrough financial sector, ultimate goal work ensure financial sectorhelps economy people overcome hardship develop. of course, alwaysbeen concern issue relate finance small enterprises. we carryout regular meet opora russia president alexander kalinin several time yearto discus topical problem advance regulation areasassociated development multiple projects. we understand rather difficultfor small business receive finance even normal conditions, challenge timessmall medium-sized enterprise affect most. it hard smallbusinesses achieve favourable term protect interest course negotiationswith banks. in addition, small, medium-sized enterprise certainly budgetand need access loan daily financial transactions.normally, closely monitor sme lend trends. this year, also put special focus loanrestructuring since become highly request many company really lose revenuesand customers. not company safety cushions; even large corporates alwayshave them. moreover, rather hard small medium-sized business maintain safetycushions challenge times.i stress period still differ 2014–2015 crisis, instance. sme lendingplummeted 2014–2015, year trend generally positive. of course,it may fully offset hardship small medium-sized enterprise face.nonetheless, loan portfolio expand nearly 15%, specifically 14.7%, sincethe begin year. the number borrower increase 63.6% since early 2020,to exceed 450,000 companies. we know small medium-sized business developpredominantly owe profits, equity, bad, nowadays largenumber enterprise opportunity apply bank receive loan duringthis period.indeed, company apply loan force primarilyassociated need make decrease revenue second quarter.the preferential lend programme launch government essential regard,including 0% wage loan 2% programmes. bank grant 0.5 trillionrubles since begin year within programmes. i would like remind that,in order support programmes, maintain lending, bank russia also launchedits preferential refinance instrument banks, addition one exist earlier, withthe limit 500 billion ruble exactly support portfolio projects. we well aware that,although lend programme state guarantees, sureties, well corporate suretieshave expanded, preferential programme accessible enterprises, smallportion them. the objective programme incentivise bank maintain 1 / 5bis central bankers' speech lend amounts. in words, bank reduce sme lend considerably,including preferential standard programmes, receive fund centralbank rather attractive interest rate, recently equal 2.25%. this resource trulyhelped maintain lend volumes.a survey opora russia — closely monitor survey find — show thatbusinesses generally record high accessibility loan recent months. we appreciate thisview.nonetheless, see currently loan mostly concentrate large banks,but confident bank basic licence regional bank capableto significantly contribute small business development become flexible sincethey good understand clients’ interest regional specifics. we go advance thissegment bank system. not large bank access special-purposeinstrument: 55 bank use it, include regional bank bank receivedcorporate sureties.as regard loan restructuring, know, important aspect improvingthe financial system resolution measure many years, order make resilientand capable support client challenge periods. we see bank sectorhas really demonstrate readiness provide support considerable portionof borrower hard period. more 80% restructure loan underbanks’ in-house programmes, require law.since begin year, amount restructure sme loan reach 819 billionrubles, 15% sme portfolio.initially, plan restructure option incentive bank restructure loanswould remain effective 30 september, decide extend measure untilthe end year. the number loan restructure application currently go down,but restructure still requested. many company enough time recover.furthermore, could also affect restriction implement range regions.therefore, day ago decide extend option sme loan restructure untilthe end 2021 q1, apply new repeat restructurings. we certainlygoing monitor situation changes. moreover, i would like remind thatwe extend regulatory relaxation bank relate provision restructure loansuntil 1 july. this privilege also available large corporates 1 april. this concession periodwill also cover loan restructure 2021 q1. in addition, recommend lendersand credit history bureau take account restructure negative factorin borrowers’ credit histories. i know many small medium-sized enterprise focusedon issue sensitive topic them.i would like thank opora russia become mediator process loanrestructuring. at first stage, business especially stress due restrictionsand uncertainty support programme gain momentum thenand bank yet adjust business process since number restructuringapplications really enormous nobody could expect that, bank russiatogether opora russia business association create ‘green line’mechanism business apply regard problem relation banks.as result, business association communicate bank directly,and fail solve problem, bank russia intervened. this mechanism provento efficient highly requested. therefore, decide make permanent one.we well aware small company may really face difficulty try gain banks’consideration loyalty towards them. therefore, good lobbyists,in good sense word. 2 / 5bis central bankers' speech a i already say beginning, critical u make communication betweenthe financial sector general small business easy possible. this relatedto accessibility loans.today, i would like dwell three issues. of course, also aspects, sincetime limit i focus three issues.firstly, certainly anti-money launder counter-terrorism finance (aml/ctf). thisis acute topic businesses, already discuss many times. the secondissue fast payment system evolve benefit provide smes.the third topic i may ignore currently widely discuss digital ruble whatit give businesses.as regard aml/ctf problems, hold, i hope also comprehend it, anti-money launder procedure absolutely crucial since protect bank systemand economy general ‘dirty’ business crime. however, procedure havetheir drawbacks. bank may behave suspiciously even towards lawful companies, haveobserved this. bank ready investigate situation small client thatdo bring high profits, small medium-sized enterprises. it easy bank justto block transaction consider carefully. a result, affect bona fidebusinesses. we employ mechanism rehabilitate affect companiesfor already, aware entire system require redesign cost needto lower. of course, possible firm rehabilitated, would betterto avoid situation company undergo procedures, includingan examination commission, since stressful market participants.therefore, discuss topic already last year, progress activephase effort aim establish centralise information service know yourcustomer, kyc, get use saying. this platform make possible reducethe number banks’ refusal companies’ expense communication banks.clients’ risk assess banks, platform develop bank russiathat classify company three risk group accord traffic light principle. bank willbe able focus group risk sign analysis operationsof client involve potentially high risks.we go launch platform regular operation end 2021 scaleit embrace credit institution end 2022 q1. of course, believe thatit make life easy smes. we also discuss improve platform togetherwith you.the second issue fast payment system (fps).initially, launch enable p2p transfers. we see highly requested. however,right beginning, build system consider need retailer smallbusinesses comprehend system may help smes cut cost significantly.the fps address issue high acquire fee considerably reduce cost tradeand service companies. in contrast direct cap fee amounts, disturb balancein market. the fps fee 2–3 time low acquire fee may exceed 0.7%.another advantage fps help reduce cash gap since fund transferredvia fps credit companies’ account instantaneously. this speed turnoverof enterprises’ funds, also essential business.the third aspect fps easily deployed. this system require additionalequipment, necessary software may promptly instal already exist 3 / 5bis central bankers' speech terminal cash desks. installation debug take two three dayson average. at begin next year, also launch mobile application fps.it enable retailer integrate system faster, without need create theirown apps. moreover, application function well.we go carry regular train workshop fps, first one scheduledfor 15 december. so, welcome join it. in future, hold event together withopora russia business associations.and last topic i would like touch upon digital ruble.in october, release consultation paper digital ruble. you welcome readit interest in. a know, many foreign central bank currently conductinganalytical study well. a number banks, instance china, already start testingdigital currencies. we may talk global technological revolution central bank willcreate new form money.what difference digital ruble currently exist cash non-cashmoney forms?firstly, digital ruble obligation central bank, commercial banks, whichmakes similar cash rubles. for hold digital rubles, imply willpreserve money, whatever happen banks.secondly, digital ruble enable fast reliable payment settlements.we currently explore several model design digital ruble organise interactionbetween customers, central bank commercial bank differently, model havethese advantages. these faster, reliable secure payments.to certain extent, digital ruble also blur distinction cash non-cashpayments. we study option launch offline payment digital rublesvia special-purpose wallets, challenge issue. this enable people pay withdigital ruble even internet connection cash.for company operate localities, remote areas, option reduce cash turnovercosts.of course, digital ruble may also create new risks, closely explore them. thesemay include cyber risk impact new form money financial sector,primarily banks, monetary policy.we take effort carry comprehensive discussion benefit riskswith business community, financial sector, lawmakers. you also welcome jointhis discussion. we plenty format take part it.at moment, see bank concern digitalruble — perceive factor may decrease profits. just fps, instance,that level even possibility bank trade service company negotiatecooperation term process payment strengthen competition market, digitalruble decrease cost businesses, but, hand, may seize part banks’fee income transactions. we believe natural trend developmentof financial system: financial intermediary become increasingly cheaperfor economy earn revenue owe new product service

reform congress deputy pablo hernández de  governor 22.12.2020 1 lady gentlemen, i appreciate request i appear audit committee democratic quality, fight corruption, institutional legal reform address question impartiality autonomy independent economic authorities. allow take start point address importance economic literature attribute recent decade quality institutions, linchpin economic development growth. a part broad notion quality institutions, independent agency – government control management power – particularly important achieve certain goals. indeed, area economy independent institution long-standing tradition market economy basic pillar institutional structure. the rationale behind institution lie consideration general interest, conviction independence allow great benefit society would attain power assume directly political authorities. independent agency acquire status decision maximum political authority state (parliaments), give remit specific decision-making area (for instance, monetary policy central banks) legal framework decide act independently matter purview. the public interest objective underlie status independence lead view value preserve strengthened, benefit properly fulfil mission agency entrust and, thereby, great social well-being. in event, independence accompany guarantee professional competence personal integrity member independent body, especially senior officials, control subject accountability. to attain guarantees, control accountability, action must take selection, appointment dismissal procedure individual management governance position independent body, transparency conduct results, governance institution. i shall commence review argument justify independence economic authority supervisors. i shall address element give shape institution’s formal independence, specific configuration case banco de españa. thirdly, i shall offer think status independence necessary, insufficient, condition independent agencies. i shall highlight potential way strengthen independence banco de españa, move thereafter identify potential improvement financial supervision model spain. lastly, i shall refer institution’s control mechanism transparency standards, certain governance aspects. 2 1 the value independence economic authority supervisor in area economy, monetary policy financial supervision two sphere habitually occupy independent institution develop countries.1 in case, euro area, european central bank (ecb) – whose system banco de españa part – independent monetary authority whose primary objective maintain price stability (see annex 1). moreover, banco de españa has, among functions, regulatory supervisory responsibility bank sector (the ecb also assume responsibility respect significant institutions). it also responsible stability financial system whole, preventive resolution financial institution (in framework european single resolution mechanism), protection bank customers, supervision payment service provider correct operation payment system market infrastructures. further, advise government, produce report study compile publish statistic relate functions. the national security market commission (cnmv) independent agency entrust oversight inspection spanish security market activity security market players. other area economy also habitually cover independent agencies. case point, name few, defence competition regulation specific industries, energy telecommunication (under responsibility national market competition commission – cnmc – spain), audit public sector account economic management (carried spanish court auditors) and, recent development, effective compliance general government sector principle budgetary stability (the preserve independent authority fiscal responsibility, airef). a i stated, ultimate aim assign function independent agency obtain institutional design ensure great level collective well-being. in respect, allow begin recall main reason control inflation assign independent monetary authority large number economies. the argument economic literature call “time inconsistency”, highlight role expectation agents’ behaviour. i believe price stability unquestionably enhance economic growth improve well-being long run. however, monetary authority independent and, regard short-term goals, us monetary policy stimulate demand repeatedly would consistent inflation objective, inflationary bias generated. in short run high level economic activity employment attained, cost emerge later. the inflationary bias ultimately anticipate incorporate agents’ expectation and, therefore, price-setting wage bargaining. the outcome high inflation without last improvement economy’s level output employment. this detract monetary policy efficiency commitment price stability cease credible. take long view price stability require difficult political authorities, may naturally incline give priority shorter-term considerations. moreover, generally, change government usually entail change political goal and, frequently, replacement previous commitment new ones. that difficult square objective credibility private agent demand take 1 a detail discussion independent economic agency spain find j. segura (coord.) (2018), reguladores supervisores económicos independientes: el caso español, fundación ramón areces. 3 decision medium long-term results. also, eminently technical nature function central bank likewise warrant status. all argument could extend economic regulatory supervisory agency monetary authority. indeed, independence one principle envisage “best practice principle governance regulators”, document release organisation economic -operation development (oecd), avoid undue influence maintain confidence. the operational independence bank supervisor vis-à-vis government interest sector supervise also part “core principle effective bank supervision” set basel committee bank supervision.2 in respect, empirical evidence show independent authority supervisor provide great legal security effectiveness fulfilment mandate other, alternative institutional arrangements. true, independence specific reason agency entrust advising, monitor evaluate public policies, whether budgetary nature. institutional independence best mean ensure evaluation make accordance objective technical criteria, remove political opinion interest evaluated. i also wish emphasise value independence come compilation publication statistic analytical study economic supervisor part mandate. for functions, expert need adhere technical judgement, free interference conflict interest, work essential monitor national authorities, international organisation public large general economic situation specific sectors. independence field statistical economic analysis mean institution must work demand environment data quality, statistical reliability analytical rigour essential. and message convey recommendation make entail short-term cost exchange long-term beneficial objectives. 2 the configuration independent agency: case banco de españa if independence agency assume function general interest effective, independence must formally acknowledge regulatory sphere. it worth distinguish institutional, legal, functional financial independence personal independence agency’s senior officials. the regulatory reference banco de españa independent agency set 1994 law autonomy, treaty function european union (eu), statute european system central bank single supervisory mechanism (ssm) regulation. this independence mere legal expression since, i shall stress, accompany several element enable effectively exercised. 2 also, realm european single market, necessary consistency various coexist supervisory framework advise bank supervision exercise independent institution. this reflect assumption ecb supervisory responsibility european significant financial institution 2014. 4 first, banco de españa institutional independence regulation ensure capacity govern body act autonomously, without hierarchical subordination high authority. indeed, provide law autonomy, exercise function derive membership european system central banks, government may give instruction banco de españa, latter may seek take them.3 these principle also applicable function exercise bank supervisor within ssm. give dual role banco de españa national central bank eurosystem supervisory authority ssm, independence take extra dimension regard necessary guarantee performance function autonomously (which mean separately) within single institution. in respect, stress governance banco de españa underpin orderly distribution different power among body law autonomy specify govern body institution: governor, deputy governor, govern council executive commission. thus, function assign banco de españa law perform balance way bodies, accordance power set annex 2. these arrangement base presence collegiate body significant percentage independent council member (by way example, six ten council member vote right govern council) appoint basis competence, knowledge experience field economics, financial system law. legal independence represent institution’s legal personality, different state general government agency may have. a result personality, banco de españa autonomy assume contractual right obligation third party take decision remit, legally bind concerned. functional independence mean that, principle observance law general interest govern conduct, banco de españa instrument need perform function autonomy decide internal resource process deploy fulfil objective assign it. this autonomy extend internal organisation (divisions, department posts, task procedures). a exception, matter i shall return, currently possibility government review decision supervisory sphere. personal independence mean senior management, council member employee banco de españa work “independently” exercise function entrust institution. here, independence mean decision take attendant actions, member institution must free external interference guide exclusively rigour professional competence. 3 article 7(4) law autonomy banco de españa, keep article 130 treaty function eu, states: “when exercise power carry task duty confer upon treaty statute escb ecb, neither european central bank, national central bank, member decision-making body shall seek take instruction union institutions, bodies, office agencies, government member state body. the union institutions, bodies, office agency government member state undertake respect principle seek influence member decision-making body european central bank national central bank performance tasks." 5 in practice, personal independence institution’s senior official seek arrangement respect appointment, exercise mandate stand-down post set place, general rule, beforehand. the independence banco de españa’s senior management relation political authority influence sector supervise reinforced, inter alia, by: i) specific selection procedure post governor, deputy governor council members, governor’s appointment make proposal prime minister, among person recognise competence monetary bank matter prior appearance minister economy require competent parliamentary committee report candidate;4 ii) term office governor deputy governor six year (exceeding electoral cycle) non-renewable; iii) set specify cause dismissal post governor, deputy governor elect council members;5 iv) incompatibility rule governor, deputy governor council member subject; v) specific conflict interest rule applicable term office include restriction financial transaction private investments; vi) prohibition pursuit professional activity relate credit institution security market two year follow stand-down post (see annex 3). a regard staff institution, banco de españa, legal imperative, recruit employee observe principle equality, merit, ability openness. these principle prevail throughout career within institution. job security banco de españa employee rest protection afford labour market legislation, strengthen various in-house policy (e.g. regard leave absence establishment extension period leave). lastly, financial independence mean independent institution sufficient financial resource equip material human resource pursuit mission. in respect, banco de españa sufficient financial capacity result revenue source legally statutorily assign it, able draw revenue cover function costs. the difference year’s revenue cost make public treasury, bolster state revenues. accordingly, banco de españa us resource available observe principle efficiency effectiveness govern use public funds. i believe banco de españa’s legal framework experience financially organisationally independent institution good benchmark future re-design economic supervisor spain which, cases, enjoy le autonomy. 4 article 24 law autonomy provide governor banco de españa shall appoint king follow proposal prime minister. nominee must spanish must recognise competence monetary bank matters. prior appointment governor, minister economy finance shall appear relevant parliamentary committee term envisage article 203 spanish parliamentary internal regulations, report propose candidate. the deputy governor shall appoint government follow proposal governor must meet condition governor. the six elect council member shall appoint government follow proposal minister economy finance, consultation governor. they must spanish recognise competence economy law. finally, two elect member executive commission shall appoint govern council banco de españa, follow proposal governor, among council's elect members. 5 only prosecution deliberate crimes, permanent disability, incompatibility arise term office serious non-fulfilment obligation cause dismissal. 6 3 formal independence: necessary insufficient condition although independence must base sound legal framework, formal “independence” necessary insufficient condition independent agencies. independence must effective and, therefore, must credible. in words, “independent” agency must recognise society one operate independently within area competence. this require complete trust action govern exclusively true fair compliance mandate entrust it, best way serve general interest. in consequence, connect channel society must maintain reinforced. this result pro-active exercise institutional transparency accountability fulfilment mandate, i shall detail later. moreover, forget independent agency’s efficiency impervious surroundings. accordingly, preserve independence prevent overload institutions, must recognise performance also depend action take economic policy areas.6 monetary policy evident example this, especially monetary union single monetary policy coexist country’s macroeconomic policies. indeed, governance economic monetary union recognise need single monetary policy accompany fiscal structural policy consistent economic stability. with goal mind, wide range coordination supervision mechanism put place, stability growth pact (sgp) macroeconomic imbalance procedure. such consideration also applicable area activity independent institutions, financial stability bank supervision case banco de españa. indeed, consideration justify central banks’ frequent call appropriate economic policy mix. and framework assurance economic stability citizen politician place declaration independent monetary authority economic policy conduct general. in respect, i indicate earlier, function banco de españa include advise government produce report studies. the present crisis provide u good example. the robust monetary policy action ecb, necessary were, would insufficient act alone. the various fiscal expansion measure take national government and, fortunately occasion, also european union overall, decisive supplement adopt monetary authority. similarly, post-crisis, monetary policy efficiency necessary macroeconomic stability require fiscal authority apply budget policy ensure public finance sound. this mean recovery 6 one obligation ecb ncbs must fulfil actions, necessarily link independence key ensure price stability, prohibition monetary financing. this prohibit central bank finance obligation incur public sector third parties. this prohibition lay article 123 tfeu article 13(2) law autonomy banco de españa. pursuant provisions, overdraft facility type credit facility ecb ncbs favour european union member state public authority body prohibited, purchase directly ecb ncbs debt instruments. the scope prohibition monetary finance specify council regulation (ec) no 3603/93 13 december 1993. the ecb monitor closely compliance prohibition monetary finance part article 271(d) tfeu prepare annual report ncbs’ fulfilment obligation. in addition, ecb clarify scope prohibition convergence report opinion issue response consultation draft legislative provision submit ecb member state accordance article 127(4) 282(5) tfeu (convergence report 2020). 7 firmly entrenched, fiscal consolidation policy resume accordance sgp rules. 4 possible way strengthen enhance banco de españa’s independence now i wish concentrate number possible way enhance independence. these may ultimately also applicable, cases, economic supervisors. i start refer personal independence institution’s senior officials. our current system, whereby prime minister appoint governor, practice follow high proportion countries.7 in case, however, i believe would appropriate grant parliament big role appointment governor, deputy governor elect member govern council, provide case process rapid post leave vacant. parliament’s role could instrument appearance parliament prior appointment, confirmation appointment suitability technical professional sufficiency propose candidates. involve parliament appointment process would, view, raise public’s perception independence legitimacy senior officials. this would positive impact prestige institution, trust inspire society performance functions. in addition, make banco de españa’s senior management selection process visible contribute fulfil legal requirement whereby governor deputy governor must “recognised competence monetary bank matters” council member “recognised competence economics law”. participation legislature banco de españa’s senior management selection process would consistent procedure follow european parliament appoint ecb’s senior management, opinion parliament bind case chair vice-chair supervisory board. in addition, although predominant model main european countries, parliament countries, finland, slovakia, latvia lithuania, play important role appointment central bank governors. beyond europe, unite state appointment chair federal reserve confirm senate. although usual practice, country also introduce certain transparency standard procedure pre-selecting candidates. the bank england one strike examples, open pre-selection process appointment governor deputy governors. in addition,  commissioner public appointments, responsible review appointment senior official 300 public agencies, approve appointment central bank’s court directors. 7 accord issue governance central banks, study publish bank international settlement (bis) 2009, power appoint governor central bank lie head state prime minister (60% 47 institution surveyed), 23% lie government minister economy 11% parliament. in turn, accord oecd (2016), “being independent regulator”, case (more 60%) executive nominate appoint member senior management regulator country analysed. 8 i believe would also desirable unify extent procedure appointment senior official various independent agency exist spain. these procedure currently highly disparate. the possible introduction improvement appointment institutions’ senior official could also accompany reflection term office. term extend beyond electoral cycle crucial reinforce independence individual and, ultimately, institution themselves. a long term office may also advantageous standpoint accumulation experience, may determine capacity influence different international forum senior official supervisory body take part. in respect, term office governor (and deputy governor council members) banco de españa – currently six years, non-renewable case governor deputy governor – although long parliamentary term, relatively short international standard (see annex 4).8 a good benchmark future could term office member ecb’s executive board set eight year non-renewable (as case bank england). the explicit prohibition renewable term office is, opinion, key element preserved. while central bank peer share characteristic, non-renewable term office warrant nullify incentive incumbent high position authority institution ingratiate decide possible re-election. in case banco de españa, i mention already, governor deputy governor non-renewable terms, member govern council not, since term renewable once. non-renewable term could therefore also consider member govern council. indeed, i believe would make sense seek standardise criterion term office non-renewability across various independent body spain. i wish focus another aspect i consider relevant strengthen independence banco de españa and, particular, supervisory function. a i stated, banco de españa decision-making capacity performance functions. however, non-monetary policy act decision (such concern imposition supervisory sanctions) may, law autonomy banco de españa,9 subject government review via lodge administrative appeal ministry economic affair digital transformation. this ministry may thus review — potentially annul —decisions make banco de españa.10 to avoid possible government interference, establish supervisory decision banco de españa bring administrative proceed end or, words, 8 the average term office governor eurosystem national central bank ten years, assume legally possible renew once. 9 note explain configuration banco de españa preamble law autonomy banco de españa state following: “in sum, law make bank special institution within administration; subordinate government general term nonetheless enjoy full autonomy area monetary policy, good defend objective price stability set law itself.” 10 this issue international monetary fund (imf) highlight several occasions. see, example, technical note supervision spanish banks, no. 17/345, imf, november 2017, imf concludes: “the mde (ministry economy) appeal body submission aggrieve party bde (banco de españa) decisions, include sanctions. such appeal mechanism potential, least theory, government interference.” 9 administrative appeal decision may lodge ministry economic affair digital transformation. of course, decision could still contest courts. this change would equate banco de españa’s supervisory decisions, generally refer le significant institutions, ecb relation significant institutions. in tandem great banco de españa independence supervisory realm, could useful strengthen governance decision-making arena. in connection, govern council banco de españa currently comprises, aside deputy governor myself, six elect member two ex officio members. the latter sit council virtue position, namely: vice-chair cnmv general secretary treasury international financing.11 it traditionally argue ex officio member allow enhance coordination across country’s various economic financial authorities. however, coordination boost recently via creation 2019 amcesfi, new macroprudential authority, three sectoral supervisor ministry economic affair digital transformation participate. against background, interest increase institution’s independence, might desirable ex officio member attend meet govern council banco de españa non-voting capacity, banco de españa representative cnmv likewise. 5 financial supervision arrangement spain i would also like underscore that, precisely redress significant shortcoming detect spanish financial supervisory system create spanish macroprudential authority, i believe time start reflect deeply financial supervisory model exist spain.12 this would serve align international best practice adapt challenge currently face. the supervisory model relevant many standpoints, since may bear efficiently effectively goal pursue attain ought resolve possible conflict interest across different area supervised. in connection, note that, 2008 global financial crisis, country change supervisory models, broadly speaking, adopt integrate model increase role central banks. among integrate model i wish highlight one structure around two separate bodies: central bank,13 charge prudential supervision, i.e. solvency banks, security firm insurance companies, second body oversee intermediaries’ conduct protect investor customer various financial product services. 11 the director general, staff representative general secretary banco de españa also attend govern council’s meet non-voting capacity. in addition, general secretary act govern council's secretary. 12 for detail discussion matter, see f. restoy (2016), la organización de la supervisión financiera, j. segura (2018), “la supervisión financiera”, chapter 3 reguladores supervisores económicos independientes: el caso español, coordinate j. segura. for recent description supervisory model around world, see d. calvo, j.c. crisanto, s. hohl o. pascual gutiérrez (2018), “financial supervisory architecture: change crisis?”, fsi insight policy implementation, no 8. 13 integrate prudential supervision increase coordination provision liquidity bank sector oversight solvency. this strengthen financial stability. 10 the principle separate prudential supervision supervision conduct, two function discharge entire financial system separate institutions, should, opinion, core part reflection improvement make financial supervisory model spain. in opinion, responsibility preserve financial soundness financial institution irrespective nature (banks, insurance company security firms, etc.) — include independent decision-making capacity use macroprudential tool — ensure institution conduct appropriately relationship customers,14 separate assign different authority (the banco de españa cnmv, respectively). this would, view, optimal institutional framework manage possible conflict two responsibility make supervisory activity efficient effective, especially backdrop increase interconnectedness financial sector players, emergence increase number financial conglomerates. moreover, obvious synergy joint supervision conglomerates, use similar approaches, methodology resources. have single national macroprudential authority (the aforementioned amcesfi) ensure require close coordination authorities. under arrangement, amcesfi’s key objective facilitate coordination. here also include function relate resolution financial institutions, spain separate preventive resolution authority (the banco de españa) executive resolution authority (the frob),15 within framework european single resolution mechanism. this complex arrangement find countries, where, rare exceptions, two resolution function unite bank supervision authority (in spain, banco de españa). combine two bank supervisor justify grind economy information cost, consistency vis-à-vis assess implication financial stability. in event, change financial supervision arrangement i outline come parallel correspond adjustment governance framework institution whose function amended. 6 governance, transparency accountability a i emphasised, addition independence, independent authority must high transparency accountability standards, since vital confer legitimacy upon them. accountability independent body authority action activity preferably parliament. this requirement formally enshrine banco de españa two means. first, parliamentary control banco de españa’s 14 supervision conduct resolve conflict user complaint since includes, among facets, verify financial product market properly, control advertise assess whether transparency consumer protection rule correctly applied. 15 the frob also responsible management future divestment state’s hold – result government support provide crisis – capital bank subject restructure plans. 11 budget, balance sheet profit loss account, submit parliament via government. the banco de españa also regularly submit report parliament, annual report, institutional report, report bank supervision report sanction measures. stipulate part accountability parliament governor’s appearance economic committee congress deputies, present annual report prepare institution. this report provide detail assessment development spanish economy main challenges. likewise, governor banco de españa expect regularly appear parliamentary senate budget committee ass content draft state social security budget. complement regular appearances, occasional testimony various committees, recent appearance parliamentary committee social economic reconstruction spain covid-19. in opinion, accountability mechanism reinforce regular appearance governor parliament. specifically, may appropriate governor appear periodically present banco de españa’s view economic situation, monetary policy financial system, report institution’s action plan within various area remit. institutional transparency also basic principle proper function independent public authorities, give confidence credibility institution basis effectiveness. in respect, banco de españa transparency portal16 publish institutional plan information (functions, legal framework, organisational structure, plan schedules, code conduct, calendar governor deputy governor, personal data process records), information legal importance (documents legal effects; document subject public consultation; reports, technical application guidelines; document international organisations), miscellaneous economic information (contracts, agreements, management delegation agreement concession contracts, cultural social work, budget management, annual accounts, salary govern body member senior directors, conflict interest public employees, fix asset official vehicles, historical object art collection). the banco de españa also long-standing tradition publish statistic analysis research reports, include annual report, financial stability report, economic bulletin statistical bulletin. in addition information provide website, banco de españa run specific web portal bank customer portal; education portal finance all (on financial literacy); portal encourage use e-administration, virtual office. look ahead, set objective improve quality statistic publications, along clarity accessibility, bring within reach broad possible audience. i would also like share commitment take active role directly explain public rationale behind main economic decisions, addition associate operate rules, main characteristic aspect shape economic financial environment. accordingly, intend broaden bank’s participation academic, 16 ://.bde.es/bde/es/secciones/sobreelbanco/transparencia/ 12 professional social forum presence may prove beneficial. this include use new communication instruments, recent open several social medium accounts, regular contact press explain activity content reports. we also aim build long-standing initiative field information, education financial literacy. here, i would also like underline commitment improve institution’s transparency. for instance, transparency portal provide detail information calendar appearance governor deputy governor, document pertain integrity expect high-level officials. in addition, deputy governor i, representative ecb’s supervisory board govern council, respectively, sign new code conduct.17 this increase personal commitment high ethical standard order ensure independence public private sector avoid potential conflict interest. in connection, i wish emphasise desirability timeliness independent public institution type ethical conduct framework, key element proper performance high-level official roles. from standpoint, aforementioned code conduct high-level european central bank official include ethical conduct criterion particularly relevant independence, impartiality, professional secrecy public private appearance high-level officials, addition specific obligation avoid conflict interest, relationship interest groups, private financial transaction advantages, award invitation offer result position (for details, see annex 5). a i report parliament, early year banco de españa approve strategic plan, whose essential content make public. base analysis challenge face institution main strength weaknesses, plan set priority objective come year action require accomplish them. aside importance exercise standpoint internal coordination, i believe draw publication plan fundamental transparency-enhancing factor facilitate evaluation effectiveness bank’s actions. accordingly, strategic plan activity subject assessments. should see fit, could report house content strategic plan, headway make implementation result assessments. i turn another aspect key understand correct configuration independent authority: good governance. this understand term observe certain basic principle public action (such efficacy effectiveness) impartiality due diligence, also implement procedure collegiate decision ensure primary institutional course action uphold public interest. a i already said, banco de españa collegiate bodies, govern council executive board. these, along governor deputy governor, make govern bodies. the fact collegiate body broad power relation function bank majority (six) member govern council elect recognise competence field economics, financial system legal arena, reinforce independence institution. 17 eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/txt/html/?uri=celex:52019xb0308(01)&from=en 13 a good governance practice structure committee support govern bodies. these able appropriately ass address various matter fall within organisation’s remit, ensure overall view relevant area institution participate analysis issue concerned. this situation currently exist banco de españa, solid structure base audit committee 12 committees, significant mandate, steer committee recently create financial stability committee. this modus operandi particularly important analysis economic policy general, monetary policy particular, well exercise supervisory powers, give complexity environment regulations, profusion data, influence external internal factor different element need take consideration ass probability severity risks. all mean every possible viewpoint expert prove experience specialisation required, ensure responsible body position take appropriate decisions. this way proceed also one commonly use central bank supervisory peers. it embedded, example, structure ecb, include various committee support decision-making bodies, representative ncbs ecb, ssm, base joint supervisory team (jsts) staff ecb national authority participate formulate proposal submit supervisory board. this body decide action take area collegiate basis, high-level representative composed. the supervisory board’s decision finally submitted, mean non-objection procedure, govern council ecb, ultimately responsible adoption. a regard action relate le significant institutions, banco de españa supervise directly, procedure report progressively align ecb practices, process continue go forward. finally, direction improve institutional governance, intention continue foster collegiate function govern bodies, strengthen function committees. there i shall finish i remain disposal house question clarifications. 1 annex 1 the banco de españa’s participation eurosystem 1 participation european system central bank 1.1 the eurosystem the eurosystem monetary authority euro area make european central bank (ecb) national central bank (ncbs) member state whose currency euro, one banco de españa.1 the primary objective eurosystem maintain price stability accordance article 127(1) treaty function european union (tfeu). accord article, eurosystem shall also support general economic policy union. to pursue fundamental objective price stability, eurosystem basic function define implement monetary policy. it also entrust basic functions, conduct foreign-exchange operation consistent exchange rate policy established, hold manage official foreign-exchange reserve member states, promote smooth operation payment systems. since 2014, article 127(6) tfeu council regulation (eu) no 1024/2013 (the “ssm regulation”), ecb responsible specific task relate prudential supervision bank locate participate member states. the ecb perform function within framework single supervisory mechanism make ecb national competent authorities, explain part 2 annex. finally, ecb exclusive right authorise issue banknote euro area, compile produce statistic collaboration ncbs performance functions, issue report consultation legislative initiative eu national authority concern sphere competence. the organisation eurosystem base principle decentralisation. decision-making centralised, implementation decision decentralised. in practice, ncbs perform almost operational task eurosystem: conduct monetary policy operation and, agent ecb,

production publication contribute economic analysis research. the ncbs also collaborate preparation appropriate decision adopt decision-making body eurosystem participation various committee ncb experts, meet regularly advise supply expert view various matters. around 300 banco de españa expert collaborate participation committee subgroups. the eurosystem run ecb’s decision-making bodies,2 principally executive board govern council. in addition, general council ecb’s third 1 the treaty function european union refer european system central bank (escb) eurosystem draft assume eu member state would adopt euro. the escb make ecb ncbs eu member states, whether adopt euro. the eurosystem escb continue coexist long eu member state belong euro area. 2 their nature function govern tfeu,

ecb the executive board ecb decision-making body responsible manage day-to-day business ecb implement policy eurosystem. the executive board usually meet week frequently necessary. formally, decision adopt simple majority, although practice, case govern council, executive board act collegiate body seek consensus. among task responsible for: i) prepare meet govern council, present propose

council usually meet twice month – possibility convene ad hoc meetings, necessary – also approve large number decision daily basis use so-called “written procedure” (which explain below). monetary policy decision adopt every six week and, although minute meet confidential, govern council publish account deliberation one month meeting. the governor banco de españa, governor ncb euro area, member govern council, together six member ecb’s executive board governor euro area ncbs. when govern council member adopt monetary policy decision perform function eurosystem, act representative country respective central banks, rather personal independent basis obligation safeguard interest union whole. membership decision-making body personal inalienable. 3 the president eu council eurogroup one european commission member may attend govern council meetings, albeit without right vote. quorum vote regime govern council govern council decision generally adopt consensus. if member resort voting, statute provide specific vote rule subject, although general rule vote simple majority. govern council meet require quorum two-thirds member vote right. therefore, 14 vote right would need total 21

overarch principle objective provide legal certainty, deepen financial inclusion, ensure general safety efficiency payment systems. however, ‘lower level’, rule relate payment scheme operate equally important set specific condition criterion relate payment system. a example: direct credit system define clear time-frames, debit system define charge-back rule conditions. these type rule often call ‘rule books’ jurisdiction like canada unite kingdom (). there ‘rule books’ publically available scheme single european payment area (sepa) credit europe or, , fast payment scheme. in south africa,

adopted. even importantly, ‘rules game’ must create barrier growth fintechs. we identify scenario may case. authority ensure approach to, governance processes, transparent robust. access resource two significant resource challenge face fintechs access capital access skill sets. unlike incumbent generally reasonable access finance, fintech firm specifically fintech smmes may experience significant additional challenge access finance. while consumer credit likely well-served south africa, smmes page 6 9 continue struggle access critical fund sustain even grow. this despite significant contribution business make gross domestic product (gdp) employment. the inability smmes raise fund cause number demand- supply-side factors, lack financial record inability lender tailor loan term

smmes also operate mostly informal, invisible cash-based economy. address challenge relate broad need digitise business ensure include digital economy. turn attention importance access skills: although much emphasis place technology fintech domain, people, skill talent create innovation propel change. this evidence across fintech value chain: data scientist unearth customer behaviour patterns, need ‘pain points’, software developer engineer develop solutions, business head craft growth strategy base emerge technology. however, similarly countries, particularly develop countries, south africa shortage technical skills. the 2019 south african information, technology communication (ict)7 skill survey find fourth industrial revolution (4ir) significant impact south african ict

produce new service product comparison tailor solution base consumer-specific data. while big data present new opportunities, scope available data, govern access data, pose new challenge financial service industry regulatory authority around world. a result above, access refine data key issue regulatory authority deal with. example address open bank open finance effort increase many jurisdictions. for south africa, important land policy imperative efforts. there number open question authorities. these include (but limit to):  should incumbent require share data fintechs? page 8 9  should standard share data develop regulator market?  how customer data protection ensured, commercial arrangement might arise own data?  when deal large data sets, measure place detect, respond recover cyberattacks? address open question important move fintech dial forward. in south africa, numerous fintech firm apply regulatory sandbox process trial new open bank models. to make progress within space, require incumbent fintech firm work together shape policy think policy stances. any unaddressed solution possibly continue see fintech firm use method may pose increase operational risk. the solution open application program interface (apis) therefore pressing. the industry actively engage fintech firm long-standing matter. we also need learn jurisdiction already traverse path, modestly take emerge lessons. conclusion allow conclude. the south african regulator recognise role play address access challenges. the ifwg aim demystify regulatory landscape, provide space safe experimentation, actively advance innovation. we innovation hub, launch early year, three facilitators: regulatory guidance unit, regulatory sandbox innovation accelerator. page 9 9 since launch innovation hub, receive nearly 100 query regulatory guidance unit 50 application regulatory sandbox. these number show vibrant dynamic south african fintech ecosystem is. most importantly, though, positive sign increase access regulator rule-making fintechs, enable u hear divergent new voices. in addition, innovation accelerator space u drive internally orient market-facing innovation

hurvitz conference economy andsociety 2020remarks mr yaron amir, governor bank israel, eli hurvitz conference oneconomy society 2020, virtual, 14 december 2020.* * *hello watch conference—i please today take part thisimportant professional discussion, eli hurvitz conference provide year.the past year characterize health crisis lead economic crisis historicproportions, one cross border continents. the lockdown impose response tothe broad outbreak infection lead sharp decline economic activity. we please thatthe recovery second lockdown rapid recovery firstone, thus may conclude important continue open economy tomaximize economic activity, responsible manner.the crisis also cause strong negative impact labor market—an impact include allpopulation level geographic areas. the government’s role handle exit fromthe crisis extensive incredibly important, hence great importance 2021budget, economic work plan government. i expand importancefurther remarks. monetary policy also important role crisis far, andthrough bank israel work range way minimize much possible thenegative impact israel’s economy, work time step programsthat lead economy back path growth, employment productivity, throughutilizing opportunity inherent crisis.i begin short survey israeli economy head crisis.it recall israel enter crisis relatively good state: solid growth, tightlabor market, current account surplus, debt gdp ratio decline toapproximately 60 percent, due well responsible budgetary conduct israeligovernments years—a fact i’ve define past strategic asset.israel adversely impact crisis relatively le economy worldwide. theoutbreak crisis impose limitation lead negative economic impact, butcompared internationally adverse impact gdp lower. the data throughout thesummer good thought, show continuation apolicy minimize adverse impact business drive growth employment, toopen economy responsible manner alongside maintain low morbidity.we see adverse impact second lockdown date low thanthe first lockdown, economic recovery relatively rapid. the bank israel research department present forecast two macroeconomicscenarios, depend development infection rate israel. these build basedon information october. one scenario “control scenario”, include thesecond lockdown exit path currently see them—gradually, without significantlimitations second quarter 2021.the “low control” scenario refer long severe lockdown well additionalwaves morbidity around december–january even another around march. the gapbetween scenario wide, difference two scenario mostly beingreflected 2021. 1 / 6bis central bankers' speech in order understand mean control scenario relative point havebeen coronavirus, control scenario gdp gap 5 percent andunder low control scenario gap almost 10 percent. these tremendous differences—gdp billion shekel achieve israeli economy.obviously, also good news—not regard third quarter activity also theexpected arrival vaccine. however, understand even vaccine ifeverything occur should, coronavirus least end firstquarter 2021, second quarter 2021. therefore, two scenario theforecast still relevant.when examine forecast regard unemployment labor market, cansee evidence labor market take quite time return strength, andthat also economy recover. unemployment rate high. in lowcontrol scenario, broad unemployment rate liable stabilize around 14 percent, whileunder control scenario broad unemployment rate could decline around 8 percent.i would like focus two main subjects—the labor market activity small microbusinesses.the labor market activity small micro business particularly relevant toeconomic recovery—economic activity return rapid activity second lockdown, butthe labor market recover slowly.we look 3 concept – standard unemployment, represent unemployed; theunemployed unpaid leave; unemployed, unpaid leave, thosewho’ve report they’ve already stop seek work due coronavirus. this thedefinition concept broad unemployment. the trend line past month slow thanthe trend return work first lockdown, get strong gradually slowly andstabilizes middle november unemployment rate approximately 14.5 percent.this raise question, sign structural unemployment? reason forthis business close suspend crisis reopen, oralternatively employer find way increase efficiency labor force. alternatively, couldbe uncertainty create temporary concern among employer recruit worker thistime.an additional marker concern structural unemployment stabilization inthe number unemployed four month already around 200,000 people.these data raise concern unemployed people particularlydifficult return employment circle. it important remember longerworkers detach work, human capital erodes, ability find workbecomes difficult.we also see adverse impact employment relative wages. decision makers,supported bank israel, minimize lockdowns’ limitation industry therisk infection low contribution gdp employment high. thus, fact thatthey continue work reduce adverse impact economy overall.this reflect world high tech, finance, area amenable technology,digitization. in contrast, cost inequality increased. the strong gotstronger weak become weaker. we see low wage earner morenegatively impact crisis. entire area business, wage highto begin with, culture, art, leisure, trade micro businesses, mostnegatively impacted. 2 / 6bis central bankers' speech we take care first-mentioned industry continue grow, thesame time assist area i note order allow economic recoveryand broad employment. the increase inequality create notable adverse impacton resilience israeli society, negative influence economy, andcertainly society.i see hear publication main adverse impact youth andstudents. in actuality, reality complicated. the coronavirus unemploymentnegatively impact entire economy! it without distinguish age,geographic location, self-employed, wage earners, women, men, arabs, ultra-orthodox, essentially everyone. i see important issue, theeconomic well social perspectives. let give 2 example focus:the population age 55 old still 10–15 year work ahead, aconsiderable percentage yet return labor market. it beremembered population often peak life thepeak careers. there real concern without government assistance intraining able return labor market year remain theircareer. we liable lose 15 year work productivity ten thousandsof workers.another point worth remember unemployment reach center thecountry, see today hadera gadera, area le expose tounemployment—the middle country, contain 41 percent israel’spopulation, today contain 55 percent unemployed israel.therefore important us, beyond hold training, increase flexibility ofthe ability return labor market. the mechanism exist today, bemaintained even develop further. thus, example, employee want to, can,return work part-time basis able collect partial unemployment benefits. theworker’s economic status improve burden government budget willdecline.it clear u employer immediately return 100percent activity ability increase flexibility important. in addition, alsoimportant stick model maintain employment, already discuss alot, increase ability incentivize employer retain employees.there concern even vaccine remain time considerableamount uncertainty labor market, impossible demand worker willstill low. the range step focus population need assistance willhelp reduce uncertainty “new normal” create labor market afterthe coronavirus event contain little possible structural unemployment.further this, i would like shine spotlight business owners, coursereflect demand workers. there 2 real time survey central bureau statisticsin august october, business various size asked, “how long youcontinue activity current situation continues”? the business owner estimate shouldthe limitation expanded, possibility enter third lockdown, adverseimpact expect increase.thus, example, see august, 80 percent large business claim theycan exist half year, october figure decline 54 percent. due thesecond lockdown, business owner become pessimistic regard ability survive. 3 / 6bis central bankers' speech i expand fiscal policy, government debt, importance 2021 budget andthe utilization crisis increase level productivity develop financial world.i want go back spend time issue deficit debt gdp ratio, andthe importance keep controllable level. the fact israeli economy wentinto crisis deficit debt gdp ratio relatively low.now well figure low international comparison, important asset forisrael’s economy.the reason financial market international institution confidence theisraeli economy, rat agency s&p note confirm israel’s credit rating, imfeconomists write recent survey.however, decline debt gdp ratio past 20 year derive fiscalrestraint step also factor guarantee side thefuture want low debt gdp ratio.these factor include fact years, gdp deflator increase fast thecpi use calculate debt, export price increase import prices, abig redemption public debt government.the combination factor help “pull” debt gdp ratio downward, arenot permanent, may even balance upward long term.however, important understand rat given, take noteof point raise s&p report, point possibility thatisrael’s good rat decrease economic crisis extend long expected, ifthere lack fiscal convergence medium term instability debt gdp ratioaround 80 percent.i would like emphasize importance maintain credit rating. the economicsignificance state israel issue debt convenient prices, thegovernment’s interest expenditure smaller, resource allocate togrowth driver assistance citizens.as considerable uncertainty regard macroeconomic environment, see alarge difference forecast deficit debt gdp ratio scenario inwhich lot little control morbidity.therefore, order reduce uncertainty, reduction require expenditure side, “thenumerator”, control effectively denominator side—the size ofgdp. we see change debt gdp ratio 2 scenario control lowcontrol morbidity. a noted, important ratio doesn’t run wild.this require tight fiscal restraint. we also note won’t rapidconvergence even structural-deficit target 2.5 percent.in contrast, ratio decline extent able improve productivity andgrowth gdp—something naturally improve standard live economy.therefore, need put 2021 budget already growth accelerator exit crisis, andto invest issue support productivity, human capital, decrease bureaucracy andregulation increase efficiency public sector, physical capital infrastructures—details implementation item find bank israel’s productivityreport. 4 / 6bis central bankers' speech it important approve budget 2021 soon, government’s economicwork plan. the interim budget government currently operate cause thegovernment operate budget base budget 2019, approve during2018, 5.5 percent lower, real terms, situation budget wouldbe approve base expenditure limitation.this liable lead fiscal restraint reason want time notappropriate. this impact activity government ministry well range ofentities organizations. an approve budget enable act work plan base abudget provide response need population.in addition, since 2019 budget passed, economy go manyfluctuations, budget need align need changed, renewedallocation part budget shift budget source among various goal program ofthe government.a rapid contraction structural deficit debt gdp ratio, increase tax ratesand moderate expenditures, likely impact adversely israeli economy’s exit thecrisis.therefore, recommend approve budget 2021 soon, converge themultiyear fiscal framework stabilize debt gdp ratio time willallow flexibility due considerable uncertainty. to end follow principle beadopted: 1. regular expenditure 2021 base amount total expenditure, andwill separate direct expenditure derive deal coronavirus.2. due high uncertainty, 2021 deficit consequential tax ratewill reduce without parallel decrease expenditures.3. adjustment make come years, decision increasethem blocked.4. the multiyear budget framework year 2021 determine whenapproving 2022 budget.5. instead exist expenditure limitation, 2022 budget anchor outlinefor reduce debt via “adjusted expenditure” ceiling. let’s switch speak foreign exchange market, recent week beenat core economic discourse, i try review opportunity. i speaknow reason lead

outlookstatement m elvira nabiullina, governor bank russia, follow-up boardof director meeting, moscow, 18 december 2020.* * *today, keep key rate level 4.25% per annum.as regard view economic situation, significant change sinceoctober’s meet board directors. however, inflation drive diverse factors.the board director consider ratio proinflationary disinflationaryfactors risk clearly shift towards disinflationary ones, estimate earlier.i would like dwell aspect take account make decision today.firstly, current annual inflation notably exceed path assume october’sforecast. inflation expect range 4.6–4.9% end 2020. price growthhas accelerate due number factors, include situation individual food markets.prices become volatile market primarily rise global foodprices weak ruble.exchange rate movement also affect non-food prices. accord estimates, pricesare drive pass-through ruble’s weaken autumn, also changessince spring 2020. in spring, manufacturer retailer could defer pass-throughof weak ruble price amid subdue demand inventory accumulate earlierat previous input prices. moreover, cost push inflation upwards reason well,namely shortage manpower certain industries, expense ensure compliance withadditional sanitary epidemiological rules, possible disruption suppliesdue aggravation pandemic situation.of course, acceleration current inflation significantly impact monetarypolicy, sign suggest proinflationary trend may become longer-lasting. thisis evidence material rise households’ businesses’ inflation expectations.increased inflation expectation may induce secondary effects. this another factor whichwe take account.there sign secondary effect already start manifest themselves. whatare reason behind them? a considerable rise price individual frequently purchasedproducts, even drive one-off factors, make people expect increase pricesfor broad range good services. this turn explain readiness pay moreand push price upwards. actually, already observe environment, whichonce prof households’ inflation expectation currently anchor yet.when i say anchored, i imply level households’ inflationexpectations, rather response one-off factors. the fact households’ inflationexpectations significantly high current inflation typical russia,but whole range country (even inflation low). in term monetary policy,this sensitivity inflation expectation temporary local factor induce risks,rather fact households’ inflation expectation exceed inflation measures.this clear analysis reason cause inflation deviation away october’sforecast. this deviation quite notable — +0.7 percentage points. accord preliminaryestimates, 0.2 percentage point deviation stem fast rise sugar sunflower 1 / 4bis central bankers' speech oil price 0.3 percentage point — growth grain export price pass-through price bakery product broad range food products. the remaining0.2 percentage point interpret additional steady inflationary pressure. it may result fromboth fast revival demand number industry already face supply-side constraintsand secondary effect bring increase inflation expectations. this whatmay impact steady level inflationary pressure future well.therefore, today rather important situation unfold future, includinghow inflation expectation change whether secondary effect may become moreintense. this may result longer-lasting influence one-off factor prices.moreover, take account rise inflation expectation may speedup growth demand consumer lend already expand materiallyamid accommodative monetary policy.monetary condition third factor discuss make decision. monetaryconditions remain accommodative. couple government’s support measures, thispromotes lend across segments, include households, corporates, smalland medium-sized businesses. the annual growth corporate lend reach five-year highin october. the offer corporate bond also expanding. mortgage lendingcontinues increase significantly.the portion subsidise mortgage loan slightly contract october, still equalsnearly 30% disbursements. concessional lend term remain place untilthe end 2021 h1. a number programme launch support corporate lend havealready terminated. we go monitor market interest rate non-pricelending condition adjust situation.the current economic situation another essential factor influence decisions.the epidemiological situation worsen today, expectedly restrain effect,but impact currently considerably low 2020 q2.although situation uniform across industries, decrease economic activityis drastic spring early summer large-scale anti-pandemic restrictionswere place. furthermore, company household already adjust changedenvironment certain extent, include additional requirements. therefore, may rather talkof pause recovery processes.we observe economic trend financial flow change unevenly. they havereturned normal even exceed level number sectors, industriesare far complete recovery. specifically, industry manufacture sell consumerand investment good increase financial flow pre-pandemic levels.in contrast, sector produce intermediate good (that is, intend processing)and many consumer service industry still restore financial flow businessactivity.if estimate year 2020 general, gdp decline 4% owe high performancein q3. the economy bounce back significantly response ease restrictionsand support measures. it also worth note that, amid limit opportunity travel abroad thisyear, household keep 1.5 trillion ruble early spend outbound tourism. in 2020, thesefunds could partially saved, portion amount spend russia, proppingup domestic demand.fiscal measure provide significant support economy. this year, budget spendingincreased 14% 2019. 2 / 4bis central bankers' speech recovery growth expect resume steadily spring 2021.given economic situation price movements, ratio proinflationary disinflationaryfactors risk alter considerably.indeed, demand trends, especially amid drastic aggravation epidemiological situation,continue contain price growth. however, impact currently offset above-mentionedproinflationary factors. a i already said, ass whether factor becomesteady backdrop increase inflation expectations.moreover, influence demand price also depend future changesin epidemiological situation, pace recovery process vaccine become widelyused, improvement consumer sentiment business expectations. a couldobserve summer early autumn, situation return normal, recoverymay sufficiently quick.at moment, consider early adjust medium-term inflation forecast sinceit necessary also analyse effect compete factor price movements. a regardsthe near future, preliminary estimate show annual inflation willapproximate 5% 2021 q1. further on, influence one-off factor diminish rather fast,it trend return 4% mid-2021. give accommodative monetary policypursued, inflation expect equal 3.5–4.0% end 2021, subsequently stabilisingclose 4%. we carry additional analysis ass whether groundsfor adjust forecast february, core meet key rate.as regard risk medium-term economic development inflation, estimatehas remain unchanged overall.various geopolitical risk still relevant — may provoke fluctuation financial markets,affect exchange rate expectation sentiments, influence trend russianand global economies.as always, change budget spend critical factor. this considerableinfluence monetary policy decisions.there still uncertainty estimate pandemic impact russian economy’spotential, especially amid current worsen epidemiological situation.given highly uneven trend economy price movements, need carryout additional analysis situation change whether still someroom cut key rate make key rate decision future. it hard affirmthis now. if impact one-off factor wane quickly inflation expectation reverse,it entirely possible may grind reduction key rate, yet willnot necessarily case.i would also like emphasise crucial maintain robustness monetarypolicy various scenarios. our policy aim keep inflation close 4% underany scenario future developments.we end year another important step communication. we startingto release regular report ‘regional economy: commentary bank russia mainbranches’ bank russia website. this report prepare regional branchesfor board directors’ key rate meet contain

sentiment continue rise protectionism. this far-fetched. a recent ipsos poll find significant support among canadian measure would make country le reliant international trade. the poll find much le support measure would help canadian company export more. this trouble international market essential canadian company achieve competitive scale operation canada benefit import many important ways. in pessimistic scenario, also fail diversify trade improve competitiveness. rivalry distrust unite state china thwart effort develop export market asia. investment remain weak, productivity growth continue lag. what’s more, new market access energy product doesn’t come stream, hold back canada’s ability ship number one export—oil. and without market access, investment clean oil-extraction technology dry up. the bottom line export fail rebound, trade become reliable engine growth. in optimistic scenario, many force break way. the strong rebound world trade see date continues, protectionist force dominate recent year begin fade. unprecedented international cooperation develop new vaccine supply across border prof potent demonstration benefit globalization. that success shift public opinion. government start knock tariff wall begin build, uncertainty lift government recommit rules-based trade order. in optimistic scenario, effort diversify market canadian export start bear fruit. canada’s productivity improve result increase investment deployment new technologies, boost economy’s competitiveness. canada new u administration cooperate north american approach

would $30 billion good end 2024 would otherwise. this would roughly eliminate current trade deficit. but pessimistic scenario, export would actually drift low rather recover, reduce incomes, current trade deficit would worsen 60 percent (chart 4). in reality, outcome probably fall somewhere two extremes. obviously, hope real life turn close optimistic scenario pessimistic. but hope strategy. we need think strategically increase odds strong trade recovery. market product business leader policy-makers important role play. they need work together leverage, broaden deepen global market canadian

even though chance playhere, shoelace still make one thing clear: player avoid undesirable outcome make acredible commitment.in context, central bank need commit objective price stability. in order

inﬂation, monetary andﬁscal policy are, case, work towards end. they therefore coordinate theirefforts closely.however, argument fail take account two factors. first, would dangerous assumethat weaken independence would affect inﬂation. a recent study ecb highlights, theproblem time inconsistency simply disappear low inﬂation setting. stanleyfischer, former vice-chairman federal reserve, put

charles goodhart stressesthat demographic shift could reduce global labour supply future, result high wages,inﬂation interest rates. he warn turn blind eye potential risk ofinﬂation.in view, one thing

behalf vienna institute international economic study (wiiw) oesterreichische nationalbank, i welcome year’s global economy lecture, 25th kind. we distinguish speaker today, professor pol antràs harvard university, join u cambridge, massachusetts. a warm welcome you, professor antràs, honor take time today, thanksgiving day, present view “globalization pandemics.” the global economy lecture series exist since 1999, first time take place online. while would certainly prefer meet person oenb premise usual setting, reception informal network lecture, i admit new format also merits. pol antràs would probably agree fly europe lecture thanksgiving day. and, besides, physical meet would probably attract many participant welcome today. over twenty year existence, global economy lecture host number distinguish speakers, feature major trend international economics, particular international trade global value chains: transition process central eastern europe asia effect major trade agreements, emergence multinational enterprises, digital revolution production processes. today’s lecture go cover another new phenomenon global trade: the covid-19 pandemic lead temporary collapse world trade links. supply disruption occur mainly begin crisis. demand increase markedly number specific items, e.g. health product it equipment. these good produce highly organize global value chains, subject severe disruption due restriction transport labor mobility. industry short safety stock hit hardest. more recently, large problem result primarily weak global demand final goods. page

macroeconomic policy action take recent months, national european level, play important role reactivate demand effective medication vaccine covid-19 become available. however, pandemic happen time already experience decade slow expansion global trade global value chains. this trend intensify financial crisis unresolved trade disputes. be undergo reversal unsustainable past globalization trend certain underlie factor run steam? or world economy indeed enter phase de-globalization? my personal view covid-19 crisis reinforce trend observe quite time, probably “game changer.” so far, cannot speak shorten even dismantle global value chains. after all, rather swift revival global value chain follow ease restriction summer month demonstrate stability potential support recovery. but apart empirically observable trend another issue: the covid-19 crisis may change view position economy within global value chains. after all, supply chain complex network structure rather chains, weakness single, remote link may endanger whole structure. future strategic decision may rather guide safety resilience consideration purely base efficiency grounds. upstream bottleneck identify avoid broaden supplier base improve resilience. supply chain need rely digitalization automation exploit real-time data allow fast flexible production stock policies. dani rodrik write april, “crises come two
