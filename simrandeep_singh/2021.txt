SpeechFX Markets Around the Turn of the YearChristopher Kent Assistant Governor (Financial Markets)Australian Corporate Treasury Association FX Roundtable Webinar – 17 February 2021IntroductionToday I will discuss some recent developments in the foreign exchange market, and provide someviews on the role of the Reserve Bank's various policy measures. I will also briefly discuss a modestchange to the way the Bank will be using foreign exchange swaps to manage our foreign exchangeneeds.A novel development in the market for Australian dollarswapsTypically, Australian banks pay a small premium to swap foreign currency into Australian dollars. Thispremium is also referred to as the basis, which is the difference between the implied cost ofobtaining Australian dollars in the FX swap market and the cost of obtaining Australian dollarsonshore. Most of the time the basis is positive, but over the course of 2020 the basis declined andbecame negative at shorter tenors, with a very noticeable decline around the turn of the year(Graph 1). I thought it was worth explaining what's happened in this market. [*]
But first, it's helpful to understand why the Australian banks have typically paid a premium in thismarket. They obtain foreign currency by issuing debt offshore – including via bonds denominated inUS dollars. They do this to help diversify their funding sources. It allows them access to deep, liquidforeign capital markets. They then swap this foreign currency into Australian dollars in order to fundtheir Australian dollar assets, including the loans they make to households and businesses.The demand for Australian dollars in the swap market by the Australian banks is the flipside to thedemand from other entities to swap Australian dollars into US dollars, much of which relates to theirown hedging needs. This includes foreign entities issuing Kangaroo bonds in Australian dollars tofund their assets offshore and Australian investors who hedge their foreign currency assets. Whilethe flows are large in both directions, demand and supply are brought in balance in the swap marketwith those demanding Australian dollars typically paying a small premium.However, over the past year there have been some sizeable changes in the market for Australiandollar swaps. The Reserve Bank's policy actions have played a part here by providing plenty ofAustralian dollar liquidity. For example, to date the Reserve Bank has provided Australian banks with$86 billion of low-cost funding for terms of 3 years via the Term Funding Facility. At the same time,the banks have seen strong growth in their deposits and slower growth of their assets. The net resultis that they have been well funded, with minimal need to issue bonds over the past year.Accordingly, their offshore issuance has dropped noticeably and this has led to a sizeable reductionGraph 1 [1]
in their transactions in the swap market; as shown in Graph 1, the major banks in Australia have notissued senior unsecured US dollar bonds since February 2020 (though there has been some issuanceof Tier 2 bonds). This reduction in demand to borrow Australian dollars in the swap market has seenthe basis on both short-term and long-term swaps fall to low, or even negative, levels.Indeed, for a brief period, the premium on very short-term swaps dropped very sharply, to as low as−175 basis points for 1-week swaps (Graph 2). In other words, the cost of swapping Australiandollars into US dollars became quite expensive. In recent years, this significant increase in the cost ofobtaining US dollars in short-term swaps had been commonplace for some other currencies (e.g.euro and yen) at year-end, but not for the Australian dollar (Graph 3). However, this year the effectof elevated year-end demand for US dollars in swap markets on the Australian dollar basis has beenmuch larger than normal. This is consistent with the smaller supply of US dollars from the Australianbanks than in the past. [2]Graph 2
The spot market for Australian dollarsThe Reserve Bank's various policy measures – including the bond purchase program – have also hadan influence on the value of the Australian dollar.Over the 2 months leading up to the introduction of the Reserve Bank's package of policy measuresin November, Australian interest rates declined relative to those abroad and the Australian dollardepreciated by 5 per cent in trade-weighted terms (Graph 4). The policy measures have placed, andcontinue to place, downward pressure on the Australian dollar, including the extension of the bondpurchase program announced in February.Graph 3
Since early November, however, other factors have contributed to an appreciation of the Australiandollar, which is currently around the upper end of its range of recent years. In particular, there hasbeen a general improvement in the outlook for global growth, which has been associated with anappreciation of a range of currencies against the US dollar and a marked increase in manycommodity prices. Indeed, the price of iron ore has increased by around 40 per cent since earlyNovember. Even so, historical relationships with commodity prices would have implied a much largerappreciation of the Australian dollar than what's actually occurred. While history only provides arough guide, this difference suggests that the Bank's policy measures have contributed to theAustralian dollar being as much as 5 per cent lower than otherwise (in trade-weighted terms).The Reserve Bank's use of foreign exchange swapsI'll conclude with some news on the ways in which the Bank will be making use of foreign exchangeswap markets to manage our operations.For over 30 years, the Reserve Bank has made use of foreign exchange swaps to manage domesticliquidity. These are short-term transactions (of 3 months or less) that alter the extent ofAustralian dollar liquidity in the banking system. Because the Australian dollar flows in the near andfar legs of the swaps are offsetting, they have no impact on the exchange rate. When foreigncurrency is acquired in this way it adds to the Bank's stock of foreign exchange assets. However,Graph 4 [3]
because the swaps are due to be unwound within a few months at most, they are not considered tobe part of the Bank's foreign exchange reserves available for policy purposes.Up till now, the Bank has held foreign currency reserves on an outright basis to satisfy its policyneeds. This includes the capacity for intervention in the spot foreign exchange market.We also need foreign exchange to assist the Australian Government in meeting its foreign currencycommitments to the IMF (which in turn supports the Fund's lending activities). To meet this specificneed we have decided to start acquiring foreign currency via swaps over longer terms. By usingsufficiently long-term swaps – with initial durations of 2 years or more – the Bank will be able tominimise any rollover risks and hence can treat the foreign exchange acquired in this way as part ofits foreign currency liquidity. And in contrast to outright holdings, foreign exchange swaps do notentail any foreign exchange risk and therefore do not require capital to be held against thesepositions. Many other central banks and finance ministries use long-term swaps in themanagement of their foreign exchange reserves.For the Reserve Bank, outright holdings will continue to represent the vast majority of the Bank'sforeign currency liquidity. Currently, outright holdings are worth around US$35 billion. Foreigncurrency will be obtained through long-term swaps over a period of some weeks until that part of theportfolio reaches between US$3–4 billion. As is the case currently with short-term swaps conductedby the Bank, these transactions will have no effect on the value of the Australian dollar.Endnotes [4] [5] [6]I thank Dan Fabbro and Jarkko Jaaskela for their assistance in preparing these remarks.[*]An Australian investor can swap Australian dollars for US dollars in order to invest in US dollar-denominated assets.By using the swap, the investor is able to lock in an exchange rate at which the US dollars will be converted backinto Australian dollars in the future. This means the investor is not exposed to the risk that the US dollar willdepreciate against the Australian dollar.[1]It is known that the supply of US dollars in swap markets at year-end is reduced by some large international banksin order to achieve a lower (G-SIB) capital surcharge than otherwise (FSB (2020), ‘Evaluation of the effects of too-big-to-fail reforms’, Consultation Report, June). These banks may also reduce their activities in swap markets inresponse to other factors such as leverage ratio regulations, taxes and deposit insurance assessment fees.[2]For a discussion of the Bank's past use of foreign exchange swaps, see Robertson B (2017), ‘Structural Liquidity andDomestic Market Operations, RBA Bulletin, September, pp 35–44. Information on recent use of foreign exchangeswaps can be found in the RBA Annual Report (2020).[3]Spot intervention by the Bank has become less frequent as the market has developed, hedging foreign currency riskhas become more efficient and as awareness of the benefits of a floating exchange rate regime has grown.Nonetheless, the Reserve Bank has always retained the discretion to intervene in the foreign exchange market toaddress dysfunction and/or a significant misalignment in the value of the Australian dollar.[4]Beginning with the release of data in March (RBA Statistical Table A4), additional information will be made availableon the maturity of the Bank's forward foreign currency commitments (which includes commitments under swaps).[5]

For release on delivery 8:00 a.m. EST February 18, 2021         The Role of Financial Institutions in Tackling the Challenges of Climate Change    Remarks by  Lael Brainard  Member  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at the  “2021 IIF U.S. Climate Finance Summit: Financing a Pro Growth Pro Markets Transition to a Sustainable, Low-Carbon Economy”  hosted by the Institute of International Finance  Washington, D.C.

  I want to thank the Institute of International Finance for inviting me to join this discussion.  Let me start by noting that these are my own views and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.1 Climate change is already imposing substantial economic costs and is projected to have a profound effect on the economy at home and abroad.2  Future financial and economic impacts will depend on the frequency and severity of climate-related events and on the nature and the speed at which countries around the world transition to a greener economy.3   Climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy create both risks and opportunities for the financial sector.  Financial institutions that do not put in place frameworks to measure, monitor, and manage climate-related risks could face outsized losses on climate-sensitive assets caused by environmental shifts, by a disorderly transition to a low-carbon economy, or by a combination of both.  Conversely, robust risk management, scenario analysis, and forward planning can help ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks and well-positioned to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.                                                    1 I am grateful to Morgan Lewis and Kevin Stiroh of the Federal Reserve for their assistance in preparing this text. 2 U.S. Global Change Research Program, Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States: Fourth National Climate Assessment, Volume II, D.R.

  - 2 - Making Progress on Climate Change The economic consequences of climate change are already in evidence.  There is growing evidence that extreme weather events related to climate change are on the rise— droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and heat waves are all becoming more common.4  Natural disasters are a major source of losses to households and businesses; one study finds that natural disasters have resulted in more than $5.2 trillion in losses globally since 1980, more than 70 percent of which was not insured.5  Extreme weather events have been shown to disrupt corporate supply chains and impact corporate profitability.6  Chronic flooding and sea level rise negatively impact property values.7  These events are expected to increase in frequency and severity over time, which could impact borrower creditworthiness or collateral values.  With climate-related risks on the rise, governments, regulators, corporations, and investors are mobilizing to accelerate the transition to a greener economy, including through ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Unanticipated or abrupt shifts in policy, technology, or investor sentiment have the potential to produce abrupt repricing events that could result in losses on financial institution balance sheets.                                                   4 See World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Task Team, Global Warming and Hurricanes: An Overview of Current Research Results (Princeton: Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, 2020), https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/; and The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (Geneva: IPCC, 2012), 44–8, https://www.ipcc.ch/report/managing-the-risks-of-extreme-events-and-disasters-to-advance-climate-change-adaptation/changes-in-climate-extremes-and-their-impacts-on-the-natural-physical-environment/. 5 Munich Re, “Risks Posed by Natural Disasters,” 2020, https://www.munichre.com/en/risks/natural-disasters-losses-are-trending-upwards.html#-1624621007.   6 See, for example, Jean-Noel Barrot and Julien Sauvagnat, “Input Specificity and the Propagation of Idiosyncratic Shocks in Production Networks,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 131 (3): 1,543–92.     7 Also Francesc Ortega and Süleyman Taspinar, “Rising Sea Levels and Sinking Property Values: The Effects of Hurricane Sandy on New York’s Housing Market.” Journal of Urban Economics, 2018, 106: 81–100. 
  - 3 - Over a longer horizon, such shifts could also have implications for their business strategies. Climate change can affect the financial system through both of these channels.  “Physical risks” refer to damages caused by an increase in the frequency or severity of weather events or other climate shifts.  “Transition risks” arise from changes in policy, technology, or consumer behavior that lead to a lower-carbon economy.  These physical and transition risks could materialize as traditional financial risks to supervised institutions, including through increased credit, market, operational, reputational, and liquidity risk.   We are already seeing financial institutions responding to climate-related risks by encouraging borrowers to adapt to and manage the risks associated with a changing climate, responding to investors’ demands for climate-friendly portfolios, and funding critical private-sector initiatives to move toward more climate-friendly business models.8 As noted by members of our Federal Advisory Council, “[t]here has been increasing awareness among financial institutions of the need to define and develop risk management frameworks that incorporate these [climate-related financial] risks into strategic decision making on multiple levels, including investment approaches and the long-term structuring of portfolios.”9   Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that financial institutions are resilient to all material risks—including those related to climate change—both currently and into                                                  8 See, for example, COP26 Private Finance Hub, “Building a Private Financial System for Net Zero,” 2020.

  - 4 - the future.  It is essential that financial institutions—and the financial sector as a whole—are resilient to and prepared for the challenges of climate change.  A recent survey of central banks found a large majority view it as appropriate “to act within their existing mandate to mitigate climate-related financial risks” that “could potentially impact the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions and could pose potential financial stability concerns for the financial system.”10   Addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, however, will not be easy.  It will require a sustained commitment—both from financial institutions and their regulators—to invest in expertise, modeling, and data, and a willingness to learn and improve over time.  Climate change presents a number of complex conceptual and practical challenges that must be considered as we work together to develop a framework to ensure financial institutions are resilient to climate-related risks.   Despite the challenges, it will be critical to make progress, even if initially imperfect, in order to ensure that financial institutions are resilient to climate-related financial risks and well-positioned for the opportunities associated with the transition to a more sustainable economy.  I will touch on a few of the conceptual challenges that will need to be addressed as we consider the implications of climate change for our mandated responsibilities and determine how best to incorporate climate-related risks into our supervisory framework.                                                        10 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Climate-Related Financial Risks:  A Survey on Current Initiatives, April 2020, https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d502.pdf.  
  - 5 - Uncertainty, Data, and Disclosure While the scientific evidence for climate change is unequivocal, estimates of the magnitude of climate-related financial risks are highly uncertain.11  This uncertainty stems from a number of factors.  Predicting the timing and magnitude of physical risk drivers such as hurricanes, wildfires, or droughts is inherently complex.  The predicted path of climate change may be nonlinear and may include tipping points or critical thresholds that, when exceeded, can lead to a significant change in the state of the climate system.12  There is also transition-related uncertainty associated with policy developments, technological change, and shifts in behavior and preferences.  Moreover, the economic and financial market impacts of climate-related risks vary across geographies, sectors, and jurisdictions and depend importantly on the existence of feedback loops.  Finally, the long time horizon associated with climate change, the lack of historical data, the potential for sudden shifts in asset valuations, and the paucity of information on the climate-sensitivity of exposures complicate the translation of climate-related risks into measures of credit, market, liquidity, reputational, and operational risks.13   Improved data, disclosures, and modelling techniques will be crucial to reducing uncertainty around the potential magnitude of risks related to climate change.  Financial institutions are collecting data and experimenting with scenario analysis and other                                                  11 USGCRP, “Climate Science Special Report: Fourth National Climate Report,” U.S. Global Change Research Program. 12 IPCC, Impacts of 1.5⁰C Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems, 2018, pp. 262. 13 Glenn D. Rudebusch, “Climate Change Is a Source of Financial Risk,” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, February 8, 2021, https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/february/climate-change-is-source-of-financial-risk/. 
  - 6 - techniques to better understand the potential impact of climate-related risks to their balance sheets and business models.14  Similarly, the Federal Reserve is investing in data and empirical work to analyze the transmission of climate-related risks to the economy and developing methodologies to measure these risks, as are other central banks.15   Financial institutions note that “the development of uniform data standards and metrics for disclosures will be critical to adequately identify and compare climate risks across businesses and sectors.”16  That underscores the importance of efforts such as the industry-led Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) that work toward consistent climate-related financial disclosures to improve transparency, reduce uncertainty, and help market participants appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities.17  Current voluntary disclosure practices are an important first step, but they are prone to variable quality, incompleteness, and a lack of actionable data.18  Ultimately, moving toward standardized, reliable, and mandatory disclosures could provide better access to the data required to appropriately manage risks.                                                    14  See, for example, United Nations Environment Programme–Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), “Extending Our Horizons: Assessing Credit Risk and Opportunity in a Changing Climate” (Geneva: UNEP-FI, April 2018), https://www.unepfi.org/news/themes/climate-change/extending-our-horizons/; UNEP-FI, “Beyond the Horizon: New Tools and Frameworks for Transition Risk Assessments from UNEP FI’s TCFD Banking Programme,” (Geneva: UNEP-FI, October 2020), https://www.unepfi.org/publications/banking-publications/beyond-the-horizon/. 15 See, for example, Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), “Guide to Climate Scenario Analysis for Central Banks and Supervisors,” June 2020, https://www.ngfs.net/sites/default/files/medias/documents/ngfs_guide_scenario_analysis_final.pdf.   16 Federal Advisory Council (FAC) Record of Meeting, (February 4, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/fac-20210204.pdf.  17 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, Final Report: Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures” (New York: TCFD, June 2017), https://assets.bbhub.io/company/sites/60/2020/10/FINAL-2017-TCFD-Report-11052018.pdf. 18 See, for example, Pedro Faria, Tony Rooke, and Esben Madsen, Pitfalls of Climate-Related Disclosures, Climate Disclosure Project, https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/784/original/Pitfalls-of-Climate-Related-Disclosure.pdf. 
  - 7 - Even with improved data and disclosures, uncertainty about the future climate trajectory will remain.19  This residual uncertainty should not stand in the way of making prudent investments in risk-management practices in the near term to strengthen the financial sector against climate-related risks.  Instead, supervisory approaches should encourage institutions to take the necessary risk-management steps to ensure their business models and strategies are robust to the wide range of potential outcomes that may evolve over time—including the possible use of new tools where appropriate.   Tools  Climate-related risks have unique characteristics that may warrant consideration of new approaches to measuring and managing risk, and new or enhanced supervisory tools.  Determining whether the existing supervisory toolkit is adequate or if changes are needed will require careful thought and rigorous analysis of the unique aspects of climate risks, including their long-time horizon, variability across geographies and sectors, and data challenges.  As always, supervisory approaches will be informed by analytical assessments and transparent discussions. Supervised institutions are beginning to adapt their governance, risk-identification, and risk-management processes, and business models to reflect climate-related risks.  It is clear that physical and transition risks could have significantly different impacts on institutions of varying sizes, complexities, and business models, and with exposures to different geographies.  Banks have told us that, “prospective guidance and regulation should be (1) designed to assist institutions of all types and sizes to                                                  19 Patrick Bolton, Morgan Després, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Frédéric Samama, and Romain Svartzman, The Green Swan: Central Banking and Financial Stability in the Age of Climate Change (Basel: Bank for International Settlements, January 20, 2020), https://www.bis.org/publ/othp31.htm. 
  - 8 - measure, monitor, and disclose the associated financial risks [from climate change]; and (2) tailored to the complexity of specific types of institutions.”20 In light of the high uncertainty inherent in estimating climate risks, scenario analysis may be a helpful tool to assess the microprudential and macroprudential implications of climate-related risks under a wide range of assumptions.  Climate scenario analysis identifies climate-related physical and transition risk factors facing financial firms, formulates appropriate stresses of those risk factors under different scenarios, and measures their effects on individual firms and the financial system as a whole.   To be clear, scenario analysis is distinct from our traditional regulatory stress tests at banks.  Scenario analysis is an exploratory exercise that allows banks and supervisors to assess business model resilience to a range of long-run scenarios.  It seeks to understand the effects of climate-related risks on a range of financial markets and institutions, as well as the potentially complex dynamics among them.  By contrast, traditional stress tests are a regulatory exercise to assess the capital adequacy of banks to specific macroeconomic scenarios and financial market shocks over the short-run.  We are closely following the climate scenarios being developed by other central banks and supervisory authorities and engaging with those institutions so we can learn from their experiences.  It will be important to think carefully about the potential for scenario analysis to support microprudential and macroprudential objectives and to consider how stress testing and scenario analysis may complement one another.                                                   20 Federal Advisory Council (FAC) Record of Meeting, (February 4, 2021), https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/files/fac-20210204.pdf. 
  - 9 - Efficiency and Robustness There is unlikely to be a single “right” approach to a challenge as complex as the financial impact of climate change.  Microprudential supervisors and regulators generally aim to promote the goals of a safe and sound banking system in the way that is as efficient and effective as possible.21  Developing an effective framework is likely to be a complex undertaking in considering the linkages between climate change, the economy and financial markets, and ultimately the risks faced by individual banks.   For instance, consider model development and scenario analysis.  At first glance, it might appear most efficient and least burdensome to apply a prescriptive approach that specifies the appropriate data and a scenario and leverages a particular credit model to produce a standardized output across firms.  Although there are benefits to standardization in some areas such as data and taxonomies, it is not clear a highly prescriptive approach would be the most effective way to ensure financial institutions are well-prepared for the range of possible impacts of climate change, even if the execution burden is low.  Ultimately, the outcomes are likely to be more robust if we innovate and experiment, and leverage a range of complementary approaches being developed in both the private and the public sectors.22  In considering the trade-off here, we should strive                                                  21 Kevin J. Stiroh, “Policy Efficiency in Supervision,” remarks at Bank Regulation, Lending, and Growth Conference, Bank Policy Institute and Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, March 1, 2019, https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2019/sti190301. 22 In our supervision of banks’ capital stress testing (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or, CCAR), we learned it was important to avoid “model monoculture” that would expose all firms to the same model risk and uncertainty and could be vulnerable to a single, common failure.  Instead, CCAR leverages internal bank models that capture banks’ idiosyncratic risks and allows for diversity and innovation of models and risk management tools across the banking sector.  See Ben Bernanke, “Stress Testing Banks—What Have We Learned?” speech at “Maintaining Financial Stability: Holding a Tiger by the Tail” financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Stone Mountain, Georgia, April 8, 2013, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130408a.htm. 
  - 10 - for an appropriate balance that allows for innovation and learning across the public and private sectors, iterating in the most effective way possible.  The Path Ahead  While recognizing the challenges, the Federal Reserve is making strides in better understanding climate-related risks and determining how best to incorporate them into our supervisory framework.  The Federal Reserve announced last month the creation of a Supervision Climate Committee (SCC).23  It will strengthen the Federal Reserve’s capacity to identify and assess financial risks from climate change.  The SCC will work to develop an appropriate program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to climate-related financial risks.  It will leverage expertise from across the Federal Reserve System to develop a robust, tailored program that reflects risk differences across types of firms and geographies.    The SCC is focusing on engagement with the private and official sectors to understand the potential impact of climate-related risks.  It is engaging with a diverse group of supervised institutions and industry groups to learn how banks of different sizes, with different business models and different geographic exposures are considering both climate risks and opportunities and what they are doing to prepare for the transition to a low-carbon economy.  We are learning a great deal from these discussions, and we look forward to continued engagement with the industry on this topic. The microprudential work of the SCC is one part of our efforts to take into account climate-related risks in carrying out the responsibilities Congress has assigned to                                                  23 Federal Reserve Bank of New York, “Kevin Stiroh to Step Down as Head of New York Fed Supervision to Assume New System Leadership Role at Board of Governors on Climate,” news release, January 25, 2021, https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/aboutthefed/2021/20210125.   
  - 11 - us.  The SCC will work with staff in our financial stability, community development, international coordination, and research and data areas to build a coordinated approach to integrating climate-related risks where they affect our responsibilities.  The Federal Reserve is engaging with colleagues from other regulatory agencies, central banks, and standard-setting bodies.  At home, this includes exploring with members of the U.S. Global Change Research Program the ways additional scientific data, models, and other information would be used to expand our analysis of weather-related disasters and climate-related risks.   Climate change is a global challenge, and we recognize the benefit of collaboration across the official sector, while also taking into account important differences across jurisdictions.  The Federal Reserve is co-chairing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Risks (TFCR).24  Having completed a stock-take of members’ existing regulatory and supervisory initiatives on climate-related financial risks, the TFCR is now focused on finalizing by midyear a report exploring the transmission channels of climate risks to the banking system and a report that describes the methodologies used by banks and supervisors to measure these risks.  Next, the TFCR will turn its attention to developing supervisory practices to mitigate climate-related financial risks where there are potential gaps in the Basel framework.  Already, many banks are incorporating supervisory expectations with regard to management of climate-related risks in foreign jurisdictions, for instance from                                                  24 Kevin J.

We also participate in the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) work on climate change.  Building on previous reports on climate-related risk-transmission channels in the financial system, with a particular focus on amplification mechanisms and cross-border effects, the FSB is now assessing the availability of data through which climate-related risks to financial stability could be monitored, as well as any data gaps.26  In addition, the FSB is exploring ways to promote globally comparable, high-quality and auditable standards of disclosure based on the recommendations in the TCFD.   The Federal Reserve recently became a full member of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a network of more than 80 central banks and supervisory authorities from around the world that focuses on sharing research and identifying best practices to ensure the financial system is resilient to climate-related risks.  Through the NGFS, we are engaged in work on the microprudential and macrofinancial impacts of climate change, trends in green finance, data gaps, and research.   In wrestling with the many complexities and challenges related to climate change, there are likely to be significant opportunities for collaboration with the private and                                                  25 European Central Bank, Guide on Climate-Related and Environmental Risks: Supervisory Expectations Relating to Risk Management and Disclosure, (Frankfurt: ECB, November 2020), https://www.bankingsupervision.europa.eu/ecb/pub/pdf/ssm.202011finalguideonclimate-relatedandenvironmentalrisks~58213f6564.en.pdf; and Bank of England Prudential Regulatory Authority, “Managing Climate-Related Financial Risk—Thematic Feedback from the PRA’s Review of Firms’ Supervisory Statement 3/19 (SS3/19) Plans and Clarification of Expectations,” letter, July 1, 2020, https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/prudential-regulation/letter/2020/managing-the-financial-risks-from-climate-change.pdf?la=en&hash=A6B4DD1BE45B2762900F54B2F5BF2F99FA448424.  26 Financial Stability Board, The Implications of Climate Change for Financial Stability, November 23, https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P231120.pdf.

Gabriel Makhlouf: Remarks on the occasion of the publication of“Love you”Remarks by Mr Gabriel Makhlouf, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, on the occasion of thepublication “Love you: public policy for intergenerational wellbeing” by Girol Karacaoglu, 17February 2021.*   *   *Good morning and good evening.  It’s a pleasure to join you at this book launch, and tocongratulate the publishers and of course the author, my good friend Girol Karacaoglu.  I’mparticularly pleased to have been asked to say a few words on the background and context forthe wellbeing work programme; it’s been a good opportunity to reflect on that part of the journeythat’s now about a decade old, although much older overall and in many ways still young.Wellbeing has been a focus of economic policy for a very long time but I’ll take 2011, the yearGirol joined the Treasury, as my starting point for today.  I became Treasury Secretary earlier thatyear, a week after my predecessor – John Whitehead – spoke at the publication of a TreasuryPaper on the Living Standards Framework saying, quite rightly, that work on wellbeing was notnew but one of the aims of the paper was “to provide some clarity around the ultimate aims of[the Treasury’s] work”. The Framework may not have been new but I felt its time had come, for a number of reasons:Economics was going through another intellectual turbulence, at least in the Western world,triggered by the global financial crisis and reflecting an emerging recognition that traditionalpolicy approaches were unlikely to be adequate to confront the complex challenges of themodern era, such as the impact of deep international interconnectedness, technological andclimate change, along with growing social disconnection and lack of trust in establishedinstitutions;For me it was noticeable that the emerging recognition of the need for different policyapproaches was not reflected in the dominant public policy narrative in New Zealand at thetime. Commentators and policy practitioners appeared to be trapped in a frame of referencethat seemed to me at best to be outdated;Apart from the Treasury’s 2011 paper, Joe Stiglitz, Amartya Sen and Jean-Paul Fitoussi’s2009 Report had helped shape my thinking, as had the Australian Treasury’s own wellbeingframework (and I recall David Gruen coming to Wellington in 2011 to talk about their work)as well as work by many other economists. Increasingly I felt that public policy had becomestuck in out-dated frameworks and that, to a certain extent, we needed to return to firstprinciples and adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to economic policy-making;As Secretary, I also felt the Treasury had a responsibility, as New Zealand’s economics andfinance ministry, to turn its vision – working towards higher living standards for NewZealanders – into a statement of possibility rather than one of aspiration. But we had to startwith developing a framework that was intellectually rigorous, that would challenge thedominant policy paradigm, that was robust enough to meet the challenges that would bethrown at it and that could create a new narrative. Effective public policy needs an effectivenarrative;Developing that framework was Girol’s job. His enthusiasm for the potential of economicschimed with mine. His intellectual curiosity, and his passion for the living standards agendarubbed off on many of those he recruited to work on the issues and turn the aspiration to apossibility.That possibility has grown but the journey is not over.  Today’s book launch allows us to reflecton what has been achieved and to take stock of what remains to be done.  As a central banker 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
who is concerned with macroeconomic stability, I am particularly interested in the managementof risk and the development of what I’ve described as economic resilience, or the ability ofcommunities to manage economic transitions, whether they are sudden shocks or more gradualmovements, all of which are at the heart of intergenerational wellbeing and the challenge of ourtimes. Thank you for inviting me to the launch and congratulations again to Girol. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Michelle W Bowman: My perspective on bank regulation andsupervisionSpeech (via prerecorded video) by Ms Michelle W Bowman, Member of the Board of Governorsof the Federal Reserve System, at the Conference for Community Bankers sponsored by theAmerican Bankers Association, 16 February 2021.*   *   *Good morning. I want to thank the American Bankers Association for inviting me to speak to youtoday. Two years ago, I gave my first speech as a Federal Reserve governor at this conferencein San Diego, and it is always great to be with you—even if remotely from our recording studio atthe Board.It’s fair to say that a lot has happened over the past two years. It is an understatement to say thatthe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges inside and outside the bankingsector. Bankers significantly adapted operations to continue serving their communities andcustomers. You overcame staffing challenges and other hurdles, kept the virtual doors open,worked with your customers, and provided assistance to workers and businesses through thePaycheck Protection Program. Those efforts have made, and continue to make, a hugedifference in the lives of many people affected by the pandemic, and I thank you.Since becoming a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I have made it a priority to enhancethe Federal Reserve’s dialogue with community bankers. I have embarked on an effort to meetwith the leaders of every community bank and regional bank supervised by the Federal Reserve.This valuable interaction helps build an understanding of issues affecting small and regionalbanks, support supervisory decision-making, and shape some of my perspective. It has alsohelped the Federal Reserve identify initiatives to support the vital role of community banks inserving the financial needs of communities.Today, I would like to share my approach to supervision and regulation, which has helped guidethe Fed’s efforts to improve oversight of community banks over the past few years and shapedour priorities for 2021 and beyond. In most cases, my points about banking regulation also applyto supervision. I will then focus on several Federal Reserve initiatives that are underway tosupport community banks during the pandemic and into the future.The first principle is fundamental to regulation but sometimes bears repeating—regulation shouldalways strike the right balance. For banking regulation, that means a balance between actionsthat promote safety and soundness and actions that promote an acceptable and manageablelevel of risk-taking. The challenge is doing neither too little to be effective to achieve the publicbenefit of government oversight, nor too much to prevent the regulated businesses from meetingtheir customers’ needs. Some regulation is appropriate and necessary but striking the rightbalance means that at some point regulation can go too far and end up reducing the public’swelfare. In recent years, the Federal Reserve and other agencies have made oversight moreeffective by better differentiating prudential regulation and supervision based on the asset size ofbanks, the complexity of their activities, and the related risks they pose to the financial system.This is especially important for community banks, most of which managed risks well before andduring the 2008 financial crisis and have managed their risks well since. Achieving theseprinciples also requires following consumer protection laws and regulations, including fair lendinglaws, to ensure fairness and broad access to credit and financial services that enable economicopportunity for individuals and communities.The second principle is that the regulatory framework should be effective, but also efficient, andthat means assessing the impact of the requirements. For the Federal Reserve, it means thatwe consider both a rule’s benefit to safety and soundness and any potential negative effect, 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
including limiting the availability of credit and services to the public, and the implications ofcompliance costs on banks. The wisdom in this approach is evident when considering the effectof a regulation on community banks and their role in providing financial services to theircommunities. Community banks have often been one of the few or only sources of credit andfinancial services to their customers. Their smaller operational scale relies on fewer staff toreach a more disbursed customer base with limited resources for compliance activities.Regulations should consider the potential impact on the availability of services in a community,as well as the costs to the bank of implementing a rule, particularly in more rural locations. It isnecessary that a full and careful practical analysis of costs and benefits be a part of everyrulemaking.The third principle is that regulation and supervision should be consistent, transparent, and fair.Regulators are obligated by law to act in this manner, and it also makes good practical sense.These principles enhance safety and soundness and consumer compliance by making suresupervisory expectations are clear and that banks understand and respect the regulatoryrequirements. Supervisors should not and cannot be everywhere at every moment. But theyshould be available to provide clarification or answer questions when needed. A clearunderstanding of the rules and our expectations and a respect for the reasonable application ofthem is an effective approach to ensure effective compliance. By promoting respect and trustbetween regulators and the supervised institution, banks are more likely to communicatethroughout the examination cycle to inform supervisors of changes they may be considering orchallenges they may be facing and how best to resolve or approach them from a regulatoryperspective.A final principle that flows from consistency, transparency, and fairness is that rules andsupervisory judgments must have a legitimate prudential purpose, and in the majority of casesmust not be solely punitive. The goal should be to encourage sound business practices andactivities by supervised institutions. By clearly communicating our objectives, we build respectfor the rules and make it more likely that any remedial actions against an institution will not benecessary because we encourage compliance through our supervisory approach. When asupervisory action or formal enforcement action is required to address violations at an institution,those actions should be framed in a way that seeks to promote safe, sound, and fair practicesand not simply as punishment.These principles that guide my approach to regulation and supervision are consistent with manyof the major steps that the Federal Reserve has taken to improve community bank oversightsince the implementation of the rules following the 2008 financial crisis. Some predate my arrivalat the Fed, and some I have played a significant role in achieving. Most of these actions involvetailoring rules that treated community banks in the same way as larger, more complexinstitutions. For example, the Volcker rule was aimed at curbing proprietary trading by largebanks, but it ended up creating significant compliance costs for community banks, which are notinvolved in this type of trading.Many of the most important improvements to the Federal Reserve’s regulatory framework involvetailoring rules to fit to the size, business model, and risk profiles of community banks. Forexample, we raised the asset threshold for small banks to qualify for an 18-month exam cycleand similarly raised the threshold for small bank holding companies to be exempted fromconsolidated risk-based capital rules. The concept of tailoring is also expressed in ourcommunity bank supervisory framework, which has been updated to implement the Bank ExamsTailored to Risk (BETR) program. The BETR program allows examiners to identify higher andlower risk activities and, in turn, streamline the examination process for lower risk communitybanks, thereby reducing burden. In fact, Federal Reserve examiners have tailored examinationsby spending approximately 65 percent less time on low/moderate risk state member bank examsthan they do on high-risk exams. We also implemented the community bank leverage ratio thatallows institutions to opt out of risk-based capital requirements. The Federal Reserve and the 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
other agencies also raised the threshold for when an appraisal is required for residential realestate loans and tailored safety-and-soundness examinations of community and regional statemember banks to reflect the levels of risk present and minimize regulatory burden for banks.These improvements in regulation and supervision have helped right the balance I spoke ofearlier between safety and soundness and consumer protection, on the one hand, and the abilityto provide financial services and best meet the needs of their customers. We have alsoconsidered the impact of our actions, seeking to revise rules that impose significant costs tocommunity banks but provide limited benefit to safety and soundness, consumer protection, orfinancial stability.As a part of this approach, I have also prioritized efforts to improve the consistency,transparency, and reasonableness of regulation and supervision. One of those efforts ispromoting greater consistency in supervisory practices across the Federal Reserve System. Forexample, we are actively working to improve the timeliness of providing banks with consumercompliance exam findings. Further, we are exploring ways to strengthen our ability tounderstand, monitor, and analyze the risks that are affecting community banks. A key aspect ofconsistency is ensuring the same supervisory approach and outcomes for similarly situatedinstitutions, with the goal of ensuring, for example, that a “one” composite or component rating ina particular region would be the same for an institution with similar activities and practices inanother region. This applies to all areas of our supervisory responsibility, whether safety andsoundness, consumer compliance, or analyses of financial stability risk.I’d like to expand on one important area of focus, which is essential to the future success of thecommunity banking sector: accessible innovation and technology integration. This subject is onethat I speak about frequently with stakeholders and our staff at the Board. We are committed todeveloping a range of tools that will create pathways for banks to develop and pursue potentialpartnerships with fintech companies. This includes clearer guidance on third-party riskmanagement, a guide on sound due diligence practices, and a paper on fintech-community bankpartnerships and related considerations. These tools will serve as a resource for banks lookingto innovate through fintech partnerships.Technological developments and financial market evolution are quickly escalating competition inthe banking industry, and our approach to analyzing the competitive effects of mergers andacquisitions needs to keep pace. The Board’s framework for banking antitrust analysis hasn’tchanged substantially over the past couple of decades. I believe we should consider revisions tothat framework that would better reflect the competition that smaller banks face in an industryquickly being transformed by technology and non-bank financial companies. As part of this effort,we have engaged in conversations and received feedback from community banks about theBoard’s competitive analysis framework and its impact on their business strategies and long-term growth plans. We are in the process of reviewing our approach, and we are specificallyconsidering the unique market dynamics faced by small community banks in rural andunderserved areas.Soon after the pandemic began early last year, the Federal Reserve took several actions tosupport community banks and their ability to help affected customers. We paused examinationsand issued supervisory guidance that made it clear that we would not criticize or take publicenforcement actions against a bank that was taking prudent steps to help customers and makinggood faith efforts to comply with regulations. This certainty of regulatory treatment created anenvironment that built trust between regulators and bankers. It enabled banks to continue to meetthe needs of their customers who were struggling with circumstances through no fault of theirown.Let me conclude by again commending the important role that community banks have played inproviding financial services during these challenging times. You responded quickly to the needs 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
of your customers and communities to provide financial services with limited, if any, interruption.You persevered to implement the largest proportion of Paycheck Protection Program funds tosmall businesses, whether they were your existing customers or new customers. Theserelationships are the hallmark of community banking, and as we look toward the future,community banks will continue to play an essential role in supporting customers, deliveringfinancial services, and providing resources to their communities and customers.Let me stop here and thank the organizers for another opportunity to speak to you at thisimportant conference. I look forward to your questions, Rob. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Klaas Knot: Getting the Green Deal done – how to mobilizesustainable financeKeynote address by Mr Klaas Knot, President of the Netherlands Bank (DNB), at an open eventorganized by Bruegel, 11 February 2021.*   *   *Thank you. It’s great to be able to speak here. Over the years, Bruegel has become synonymouswith excellent and policy-relevant research. Your work helps people like me to do our jobs better.That is also recognized by others. In the  “2020 Global Go To Think Tank Index Report” publishedby the University of Pennsylvania only two weeks ago, Bruegel ranks as the number one non-USthink tank in the world. That’s worthy of congratulations!Let me start by taking you back thirty years ago, when Europe stood before the great economicchallenge at that time: transforming the crippled communist economies of Central and EasternEurope into modern market economies. When I worked at the IMF in the late 1990s, in ourreports we referred to this group of countries as transition economies.As Bruegel has also pointed out, thirty years later we are all transition economies now. Not onlymust we make our fossil-based economies carbon neutral by 2050, to prevent catastrophicclimate change. But we must do so while recovering from a public health and economic crisis. Ifocus on climate change, but the challenge is really much broader. It includes all forms ofenvironmental degradation that make our economies unsustainable.Europe’s Green Deal tackles these multiple crises head-on. It is ambitious, it is comprehensive,and it focusses on growth. And with the Next Generation EU recovery package, andreinforcements to the EU budget, it is backed by unprecedented public financial firepower. Thenew Sustainable Finance Agenda that is coming out soon, will likely provide plans to mobilizemuch needed private investments. And that is exactly why the best economic response to theCOVID crisis is to start implementing the Green Deal as soon as possible. After the euro crisis,after Brexit, Europe is leading the way, which makes me a proud European today.But true leaders not only show the way. They also make sure everyone is on board. Theintroduction to the European Climate Law proposal states, and I quote:The European Green Deal reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to make Europe the firstclimate-neutral continent by 2050.’End of quotation.Laudable in and of itself. But frankly, it would be much better for the planet if, by 2050, we werethe last continent to be climate-neutral. Because that would mean that other nations have caughtup with us and even surpassed us. And then the whole world will have become climate neutralbefore the crucial 2050 deadline.I am optimistic that Europe will team up with the new American leadership, and possibly withChina and India and others, to form the powerhouse, the engine, that gets the world back ontrack to meet the Paris agreement. Because in order to get the energy transition really done, wewill need to work together in many areas. Because there’s not a European, or an American or aChinese climate problem, there is only a global climate problem.Now let’s go back to Europe. As we all know, getting the European economy sustainable forfuture generations requires large investments. A big part of these investments need to be madeby the private sector. And for these private investments to scale up sufficiently, and for thefinancial sector to finance them, we need to get the right conditions in place. What needs to be 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
done? And what can governments, central banks and supervisors do? That is what I want todiscuss with you today.First of all, we need a better business case for green investments. One policy instrument isabsolutely key here, and that is to raise the effective price of greenhouse gas emissions. Carbonemissions are the main, but not the only contributor to greenhouse gases. You see, I’m aneconomist. Some may call it naïve, but I have this firm belief, backed by experience, that foreconomic transformation to take hold, you need to have relative prices that reflect the truescarcity of economic resources. In this case, by pricing in the climate cost of greenhouse gasemissions. Internalizing the externality. That will make it far easier for firms and households todetermine the future value of their assets and liabilities. This will alter their incentive framework.Then, market forces will drive things in the right direction. This ball lies squarely in the court ofgovernments. The EU Green Deal sets out ambitious plans to make carbon pricing moreeffective, and it is crucial these plans are not watered down. This is the one thing that makes allthe other things that we do, much more effective.Secondly, investors and the financial sector need clear and credible transition plans fromgovernments. A plan that provides answers to questions like: what emission targets will be metand when? What actions are necessary to achieve these targets? What regulation is going to beimplemented and in what sequence? What investments will the government make itself? Howare we going to compensate vulnerable groups? In answering these questions we can drawlessons from the economic transition of thirty years ago. For example, I recall the debate about‘gradualism’ versus ‘cold turkey’. Some reforms, like changing relative prices, you may have todo as soon as possible. Others, like changes in productive capacity, will take more time.What’s also important is that it should be a plan that will still be in place after the next election. Aplan that gives investors a sense of where we are going. That offers perspective, providesopportunities, and reduces investment risk. Here, again, I think the Green Deal goes a long wayin fulfilling this need for a comprehensive plan. And now we have to enshrine it in law, work outthe details and get it implemented.Apart from carbon pricing and having a plan in place, what else do we need to do to get themoney flowing to where it’s green?Well, thirdly, banks, insurance companies and pension funds need to be more aware of theclimate risks they face. And manage these risks accordingly. Financial institutions are vulnerableto the physical consequences of a changing climate. Just ask the insurance companies. And, asI said, it is broader than climate change. In last year’s report Indebted to Nature, we showed thatDutch financial institutions alone have over half a trillion euros in exposures to companies withhigh or very high dependency on a well-functioning ecosystem. Companies whose business maybe at risk due to biodiversity loss and other forms of environmental degradation.Financial institutions also run transition risks. For instance, the bank loan provided to a carmanufacturer may be at risk if it fails to develop and build clean vehicles that meet new energyregulations and changing consumer demands on time. So climate risk is a new and importantdriver of financial risk. Financial supervisors must push financial institutions to manage this riskadequately. Just as they do with other risks.Pressing for good risk management stems primarily from our mandate as supervisors to keepfinancial institutions safe and sound. But there is an important by-product. Once theseinstitutions have a better understandingtask of the impact of climate-related risks on their balancesheets, this will impact their investment decisions. Less money will flow to fossil-fuelinvestments, and more to green investments. This way, financial institutions can become apowerful force in pushing the green transition.To be honest, I have not yet seen clear evidence of this reallocation effect playing out on a 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
significant scale. For one thing, it’s difficult for banks and other financial firms to manage theirexposures as long as they lack good information about what is green and what is not.That brings me to my fourth point, and that is disclosure. The information that the financial sectoruses is only as strong as the corporate disclosures it is built upon. That is why the quantity,quality and consistency of corporate reporting on sustainability-related information must improve.Credible and comparable information should be readily available for all market participants,shareholders and other stakeholders.This calls for a global solution. I believe the reporting of such information is most effective when itis aligned with the requirements of global accounting standards, and therefore reflected in theaudited annual accounts of companies. This also ensures a level playing field acrossjurisdictions. I think the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, the IFRS, is bestpositioned to set such standards. Therefore I am happy that the IFRS has recently announced totake steps in that direction. Europe, as a frontrunner, has a key role to play in making this globaleffort succeed. The Italian G20 Presidency has asked the Financial Stability Board to explorehow progress can be made here, based on the Recommendations of its Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.Finally, European capital markets need to supply more risk capital. At the moment, Europeanfirms mainly depend on banks for their funding, and to some extent on capital markets. They onlyhave limited access to private funding markets, which are very small in the EU, at leastcompared to the US. We need European financial markets to supply more diverse types of riskcapital needed to fund the energy transition. Risk capital that typically comes from venturecapitalists, private equity funds, and investment funds. And we also need to do something aboutthe existing carbon-bias in European capital markets. In that respect, I think the EuropeanCommission’s action plan for the Capital Markets Union could be further improved by stimulatingbetter access to risk capital for green investments. At the same time, funding of non-greeninvestments will need to become more expensive. Apart from carbon pricing, better disclosure is,again, key here. Once it becomes clear for investors that a company’s foot print is notsustainable, risk premia will rise.Central banks can also help to correct the carbon bias in capital markets. In the euro area,central bank purchases of corporate bonds follow a market neutrality principle. This means thatthe purchases reflect the broader corporate debt market. But what does this neutrality mean ifthere is a carbon bias in European capital markets because the relative price of carbonemissions is distorted? Central banks could explore how, within the boundaries of theirmandates, they can redesign their monetary policy instruments to prevent such biases fromoccurring, and instead contribute to unlocking more green investments. We could take theexisting EU policies, such as the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and the EU taxonomy forsustainable activities, as a starting point in this respect.I spoke about the need for carbon pricing and transition plans. About the need for good riskmanagement and disclosure. And the need for more supply of risk capital.When it comes to the role of the financial sector, I may have inadvertently left you with theimpression that finance always follows the real economy. That if governments and central banksand other policymakers and standard setters provide all the right conditions, then funding for thegreen transition will follow suit. Although I think this is largely true, it is not entirely how I see therole of the financial sector. Financial market players should not wait for all the regulations, andconditions, and perfect data sets to be in place before they can have impact. They perform acrucial role in the economy by helping companies to grow and create jobs and wealth. Thatmeans they have a social responsibility of their own to make sure that their business modelssupport a sustainable economy. It is good to see that many financial institutions are working onreducing their carbon footprint. To them I would say, keep up the good work, and branch out 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
where possible. And to the others I say, don’t just talk the talk, but also walk the walk.Maybe only now, thirty years later, we fully realize how much courage it took for our Central andEastern European partners to embark on their bold experiment. Without an existing blueprint.Under economic circumstances that make our troubles today look relatively benign. But they hadlittle choice. And neither do we. So let’s learn from their experience and take courage from theirexample. Even if we do not yet know exactly what a carbon-neutral economy looks like, and howit will change our everyday lives. The EU Green Deal is ambitious and bold. And now we have toget to work to implement it and to fund it. And at the same time, to reach out beyond our borders.To work together with governments, regulators, private investors, financial sector, climateexperts, and central banks from all countries. To overcome the policy challenges. And to makesure that we meet the Paris Agreement targets, and tackle climate change in time. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Warwick Economics Summit February 5, 2021      Robert Holzmann Governor Oesterreichische Nationalbank       Verlegerin und Herausgeberin: Oesterreichische Nationalbank  Referat Pressestelle Wien 9., Otto-Wagner-Platz 3 Postfach 61, 1010 Wien OPENING STATEMENT   Challenges of balancing monetary policy with fiscal policy  Opening statement at the Warwick Economics Summit 2021  In my opening statement, I would like to address the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy, as their successful interaction is critical for dealing with shocks, such as the economic fallout of the pandemic crisis, and what will come in its aftermath. First, the interaction between monetary and fiscal policy has made a comeback in academic research and the broad policy discourse. It was very much part of lectures and textbooks when I was a student (well … some 50+ years ago).  Back then, the questions were more basic but still relevant – e.g. what policy instruments should be assigned to which policy objective. The assigned instruments have changed across time, the exchange rate regime being a case in point, and other factors are being stressed, such as the credibility of a policy and its institution. Recently the discussion has moved from considering monetary and fiscal policy as strategic substitutes – with state-contingent decisions of what to use when – toward thinking of both policies as strategic complements. With appropriate design and interaction, each instrument can expand the policy space of the other: Most importantly, accommodating monetary policy with low rates of interest allows fiscal policy to expand its policy scope.  In turn, fiscal policy action can help the economy recover, thus taking away some of the burden from central banks to bring the economy back to potential and inflation back to target. This reemergence of interest in policy coordination is happening in the aftermath of stressing the importance of independent central banks and their pursuit of narrow policy objectives to be effective and credible.  The empirical analysis over the last decades on the effectiveness of fiscal versus monetary policy in addressing shocks suggests somewhat better outcomes for monetary policy but little existence of a complementary approach. This leads me to my second part:  Has this suboptimal individual policy approach and joint policy coordination changed with the current crisis? To stay within my time allocation, I will focus on the euro area.     
     2   After the global financial crisis, monetary policy was critical to overcome fragile situations for the euro and the EU economies. The implementation of unconventional monetary policies (negative interest rate policy; quantitative easing through asset purchase programs; targeted long-term repurchase programs with banks, aiming to provide financing for  SMEs, etc.) was a major contribution after 2014 to make monetary policy effective again in view of a fallen and low r* − the equilibrium rate of return (a very important hypothetical benchmark variable to which we will return).  With the beginning of the economic fallout due to the lockdown under COVID-19 in March 2020, the ECB was very fast in offering a strong monetary package, initially including EUR 750 billion for flexible asset purchases (now EUR 1,850 billion) under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), and a package of almost similar size of subsidized credits to commercial banks to lend to private sector firms. First reviews of these monetary policy packages suggest high effectiveness in stabilizing financial markets and output growth and more limited effectiveness in keeping inflation close to the ECB’s target of close to 2%. So far, side effects have been contained but need to be monitored carefully going forward. There are concerns about the longer-term effectiveness of these monetary policy instruments, i.e. falling marginal effectiveness and increasing side effects. In parallel to monetary accommodation, the national fiscal policies of member countries have been very quick and generous in supporting firms and workers in particular in sectors most heavily hit (i.e. tourism, restaurants and personal services). How the exit strategies from these support programs will be designed and achieved is yet unknown. For all euro area member states, the European Stability Mechanism established a fund with a ceiling of EUR 500 billion of credit lines early-on in the crisis, of which, however, little has been used so far due to conditions attached, albeit very mild.  The EU Commission decided on a EUR 750 billion “Next Generation EU” fund, with almost half of the amount as transfers to member states most heavily hit by the crisis. These resources should be used for next generation investments – i.e. for climate and digitalization – from mid-2021 onward.  The resources are sizable albeit not huge. Their effectiveness crucially hinges on the condition that member states indeed use them to reform their economies with a view to bolstering productivity and financial sustainability for the future. Assessed against the policy reactions in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, both recent monetary and fiscal policies in the EU (and elsewhere) have been much more forthcoming. But will they be able to offer a long-term perspective in view of the decisive importance of the equilibrium interest rate r* for both policies? This leads me to my third and final part.  What are the key options policymakers must decide on in the areas of monetary and fiscal policy? Option 1 is to consider r* − this hypothetical and estimated equilibrium interest rate − as exogenous and low or even negative far into the future. In this case, fiscal policy will be encouraged to remain generous as interest payments remain low and hence fiscal sustainability appears not an issue. Monetary policy will have to remain unconventional, as conventional policy (based on interest rate policy and forward guidance only) will not work.  In case of a further economic shock more of the same would need to be applied if inflation stays low. If inflation were to increase, however, raising nominal interest rates would threaten fiscal sustainability − if monetary policy lives by its aims.  Hence, one would live in a fragile equilibrium without an exit strategy. 
     3   Option 2 is to consider r* as an endogenous variable that is accessible to policy interventions and that can be raised back to levels seen in the past. If this were achieved, it would allow a return to conventional monetary policy without side effects from unconventional policies and allow for reduced balance sheets of central banks. It would promise growing income, as a rise in r* would to a large part be the result of rising productivity. It would require keeping a lid on public deficits and debt.  In short, option 2 offers an exit option from the current, fragile policy mix. Achieving a rise in r* will, first of all, require a better understanding on the drivers of the secular fall of r* in recent decades.  Yet, I think two policy interventions can be explored right away:  measures to increase productivity (and clever fiscal policy and decisive structural reforms will have to play a major role) and measures to reduce the savings-overhang in the global North in view of the capital need of the global South (in particular Africa, where Europe should have a strong interest). Both policy measures are desirable and useful independently of their effect on r*.  In a recent report r* was called a global public good, and I concur. In the short run, option 1 will hold true, as r* cannot be changed swiftly. In the long run, hopefully option 2 will be realized provided forceful actions are taken. Every voyage starts with a step, and it can be a green one.  
John A Rolle: Role of the Bahamian Financial Services Sector in theTransformation and Growth of the Bahamian EconomyRemarks by Mr John A Rolle, Governor of the Central Bank of The Bahamas, at the BahamasBusiness Outlook 2021 on "Role of the Bahamian Financial Services Sector in theTransformation and Growth of the Bahamian Economy", 14 January 2021.*   *   *IntroductionIt is an honour to speak at this 30th Annual Bahamas Business Outlook and to reflect on therelated themes of “recover, adapt and advance.” I would like to focus my presentation on the roleof the financial sector in this process, from the perspective of transformation and growth, and torelate this to the ways in which the policies and initiatives of the Central Bank can be supportive.Although the COVID-19 pandemic has sharpened the focus on our economic vulnerabilities,Hurricane Dorian provided a stronger jolt, because it highlighted the growing threat from climatechange that is more challenging to resolve than just diversifying our economic base. Adaptationfor greater climate change resilience will be a costly, transformative undertaking, because it alsoputs a premium on sturdier infrastructure that has to be developed and on the stronger financialinsurance arrangements that are needed.Also relevant now is improving average growth prospects, through a strategy underpinned byhigher rates of savings and investments, and increased international competitiveness. TheBahamas has to strive for faster growth in spite of the pandemic, to finance more adequatepublic services and to reduce a high public debt burden that pre-dated the pandemic. Now,because of the pandemic, new debts are mounting, just to stabilize the economy. 1 / 1BIS central bankers' speeches
Gent Sejko: Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU acquisAddress by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, to the closing ceremony of theTwinning Project “Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU Acquis”, 18 January 2021.*   *   *Your Excellences Ambassador Soreca, Ambassador Bucci and Ambassador Zingraf,Dear Mr. Franco,Dear friends from Banca d’Italia and Bundesbank,Dear colleagues,It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the official closing ceremony of the TwinningProject “Enhancing Bank of Albania’s alignment with EU Acquis”.This project launched on December 2019, was funded by the EU and followed the successfulcompletion of the previous project on “Needs analysis for the Bank of Albania” – designed and ledby the ECB, in partnership with 11 central banks of the European System of Central Banks.As we all know, the first half of 2020 was marked by the emergence and rapid global spread ofCOVID-19. Within a very short time, the world changed dramatically in ways that we could havenever imagined. Thus, the project was temporarily suspended. However, with the pandemic likelyto last, just like the rest of the world, we embraced remote working, a reality which soon becameas effective as the “traditional” way of work.  We managed therefore to complete the projectsuccessfully and on time.Dear ladies and gentlemen,The twinning program involved eight departments of Bank of Albania and addressed importantissues, in the areas of:Banking Supervision and Financial Stability;Monetary Policy and Statistics;Internal Audit;Payment Systems;Other central banking functions such as human resources and European integrationEach component was incorporated into a number of tangible results, in the form of regulatorydocuments, guidelines and specific recommendations related to policies.  Therefore, I’m happyto highlight that:New bylaws for implementing  Basel III and Capital Requirements Directive were developed;New policy papers and guidelines for approximation with ESRB recommendations weredrafted;An improved Monetary Policy Document was released;New bylaws and a new manual aiming to align BoA monetary statistics and financialaccounts with ECB requirements were drafted;New bylaws, manuals, policy documents and training plans for harmonization of Auditactivity in line with ECB and ESCB standards were developed;New legal act for Payment Accounts Directive implementation was drafted;New manuals for alignment with ECB standards the BoA payment system oversight 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
framework were drafted;A gap analysis followed by a roadmap on ECB TARGET2 system implementation wasperformed;New guidelines aiming to align to ECB standards regarding the e-recruitment process,recruitment of external applicants and conditions of staff employment were drafted;A roadmap to design the role and challenges of the European Integration Office (EIO) waslaid out;Our venture has now officially come to the end. Looking back in retrospective, I’m very pleasedand proud to say that we have successfully managed to meet all the objectives of our project. I’mconfident that the representatives from the Bank of Italy will further provide more profoundinsights on the process and results.Dear ladies and gentlemen,I could not conclude without spending a few more thanks to all the institutions and their expertsinvolved in this endeavor. First, I would like to thank the European Commission for its support forfunding this project. I am confident that the Commission will continue to support our futureinitiatives towards the integration in the EU. A special thank goes to EU Delegation here inAlbania for their valuable assistance during preparatory period of the project. I hope that soon theEU Council will approve the negotiating framework for the accession of Albania, thus marking anew phase of the EU integration process.I would like to thank Bank of Italy, for their long-term commitment in supporting our institution. Theimpressive work done from the Italian experts deserves special credits, especially under thecurrent unprecedented circumstances due to pandemic. I take the opportunity to personally thankthe Project Leader, Mr. Zeloni and Resident Advisor, Mr. Gola for their efforts and support.Absolutely, we are very grateful to Bundesbank for its active participation in the project, includingtheir leading role in the regional project on “Strengthening the Central Bank Capacities in theWestern Balkans with a view to the Integration to the European System of Central Banks”. Also,we thank the National Bank of Romania and Banque de France for their specific involvement inthis project. We are confident the cooperation with these central banks will strengthen further inthe future.Last but not the least, I would like to extend my warm appreciation to the staff of the Bank ofAlbania, who overcame the difficulties generated by the Covid-19 pandemic, and managed tobring this project to success in all of its targeted objectives.  Concluding, I iterate that the Bank of Albania remains firmly committed in its road of fastconverging with the model of European System of Central Banks. We strongly believe this is thebest contribution we can make for our country in the process of the EU integration, a strategicgoal we have incorporated in our work plans for 2021 and beyond.  I’m confident our cooperationwill continue in the future and the European support and mentorship will accompany us on everystep towards the European family.  Thank You! 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches

Not for publication before February 10, 2021 11:30 am Eastern Time     Remarks by Timothy Lane Deputy Governor Institute for Data Valorization February 10, 2021 Montréal, QC  Payments innovation beyond the pandemic  Introduction Good morning, and thank you for hosting me today. I’m sure many of you share my sentiments about these virtual events—that we would much rather be together in person, and yet we are grateful for the technology that allows us to gather online. The need to switch to this digital platform is, of course, just one small example of the changes brought on by the global pandemic. COVID-19 has claimed the lives of far too many—in Canada, we have lost more than 20,000 people. The virus has had a devastating impact on households and businesses across the country. Almost overnight, the Canadian economy suffered its worst setback since the Great Depression. One major impact of the pandemic is certainly familiar to all of us by now: the digitalization of our personal and professional lives has accelerated.  In my remarks today, I’ll focus on how these developments have affected the world of payments. I’m referring to changes in the way Canadian consumers and businesses pay for goods, services and financial assets. I’ll begin by talking briefly about the economic consequences of the pandemic. Then I’ll go on to discuss the implications for three main aspects of payments.  The first is the concept of a central bank digital currency—a “digital loonie,” as it were. For several years, the Bank of Canada has been analyzing which circumstances might lead Canada to decide to issue a digital currency. The pandemic may bring us to a decision point sooner than we had anticipated.  Next, I’d like to look at a major program of payment system modernization underway in Canada. Consumers and businesses will see the benefits of this 
     - 2 - modernization rolling out this year and next. The pandemic has underscored the importance of expanding the reach of real-time payments.  Finally, I will address the issue of cross-border payments, which are often slow, expensive and vulnerable to fraud. The Bank has collaborated with international partners on a roadmap to address the pain points in cross-border payments. We are fully committed to working with the public and private sectors to make any necessary changes in Canada to support this. COVID-19 and the digital economy The digitalization of the economy was well underway before COVID-19 hit, but the changes brought on by the pandemic have been rapid and far-reaching.  As a society, we had to quickly implement the virtual workplaces we had largely only been imagining. Nearly one-third of Canadians are mostly working from home,1 including me—I have been in my office only eight times since last March. In addition, many students continue to learn virtually.  COVID-19 has also changed how we shop. A survey of Canadian retailers shows that e-commerce has nearly doubled from pre-pandemic levels.2  Businesses are responding to the pandemic by incorporating new technologies into their operations. In our most recent Business Outlook Survey, nearly two-thirds of participating firms reported that they are making some kind of digital investment.3 Expanding their business online was commonly cited as the reason for these investments—on both the operations and client-facing sides. Among these developments is a shift toward the increasing use of digital payments. For example, a November 2020 survey found that two-thirds of small businesses now accept payments online—and half of them started doing so only recently.4 Even when Canadians pay for goods in person, contactless options appear to be gaining traction. Interac reports that the volume of Interac Flash transactions grew by two-thirds in July 2020 compared with April.5 Consumer surveys also report that contactless payments have increased.6  The Bank of Canada has been carefully watching these trends. We are particularly interested in how the pandemic has changed the way that Canadians purchase goods and services. And we are keenly aware of the need to seize the opportunities that lie before us to give Canadians even better, cheaper and faster payment methods.   1 Statistics Canada, “Labour Force Survey, December 2020,” The Daily (December 2020).  2 Statistics Canada, “Monthly Retail Trade Survey,” (October 2020).  3 Bank of Canada, Business Outlook Survey—Winter 2020–21 (January 2021).  4 PayPal Canada, Business of Change—PayPal Canada Small Business Study (November 2020). 5 Interac, “Interac Debit data: Signs of COVID-19 recovery,” press release.  6 H.

     - 3 - Cash: physical and digital  Let’s start with Canadian bank notes. As we have all embraced technology and its many innovations, one thing that hasn’t changed as much is cash. It’s true that the Bank has updated bank notes in new and exciting ways. We’ve incorporated state-of-the-art security features to combat counterfeiting. We now make bank notes using polymer instead of paper. And we’ve made a concerted effort to ensure the images and portrait subjects on bank notes reflect Canada’s unique and changing identity.  But the basic nature of bank notes has not changed—they are still physical objects.  However, for the past decade or so, the Bank has been considering these bank notes, and we’ve been asking ourselves: could Canada and Canadians benefit from a digital form of cash?  In a speech in Montréal a year ago, I gave our preliminary view: we did not see a need for a central bank digital currency at that time, but we could imagine scenarios that could make a central bank digital currency beneficial in Canada. I concluded that we would move forward to develop such a digital currency as a contingency plan, given how quickly the world is changing and the time required to develop a viable product.7   A year later, our view remains unchanged: a digital currency is by no means a foregone conclusion. That said, the world has been changing even faster than we expected. In fact, just two weeks after I spoke, the first lockdown was imposed, which accelerated the evolution of the digital economy. And so our work to prepare for the day when Canada might want to launch a digital loonie—backed by the Bank—has also accelerated.  We are not alone. In a recent survey, almost 60 percent of central banks reported the possibility that they will issue a central bank digital currency within six years. This is up from less than 40 percent only a year ago.8 One scenario we have been watching is whether a sharp decline in the acceptance of cash reaches a tipping point in Canada. We’ve already seen that as societies and economies modernize, cash has been losing ground to digital methods of payment—around the world and here at home.9  Since COVID-19 hit, we’ve seen a growing hesitancy in Canada to use cash. Although Canadians are holding more cash than ever, cash may not currently be circulating as much. In recent Bank of Canada surveys, consumers report some  7 T.

     - 4 - merchant preference for contactless payments, and some report experiencing merchants’ refusal of cash due to fears of virus transmission.10 Of course, it’s too early to tell whether these trends will continue beyond the pandemic, but we are watching closely. The other scenario I raised in my speech last year is the increasing use of digital currencies created by the private sector, including cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins. While these products have existed for several years, some could see a boost from the acceleration of digitalization in the midst of the pandemic.  Even in this increasingly digital economy, though, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not have a plausible claim to become the money of the future. They are deeply flawed as methods of payment—except for illicit transactions like money laundering, where anonymity trumps all other features—because they rely on costly verification methods and their purchasing power is wildly unstable. The recent spike in their prices looks less like a trend and more like a speculative mania—an atmosphere in which one high-profile tweet is enough to trigger a sudden jump in price. In contrast, widespread adoption of stablecoins for everyday transactions is possible, although none is near that point yet. Because in most cases they are partly or fully backed by safe assets, their purchasing power is designed to be more stable.  But many issues need to be addressed before we can be confident that stablecoins can be used safely by the general public. The Financial Stability Board is examining these issues at the global level, and I am chairing the international working group that is taking this work forward. Here in Canada, we still have work to do to ensure that our regulatory framework covers these new products.  Amid all of these developments, two fundamental questions need to be addressed: Are there benefits to issuing a digital form of money? And if yes, who should do so?  In response to the first question, we don’t yet know whether many Canadians will actually want to use a stablecoin or any other kind of digital currency when they have alternatives available—cash, debit, credit and electronic transfer. Would the addition of a digital form of cash to the existing suite of digital payment methods meet a real demand and enhance the evolution of a competitive, vibrant digital economy? More work is clearly needed to identify the potential benefits to users, compared with other alternatives. And of course we also need to study potential risks.   10 H. Chen, W. Engert, K. P. Huynh, G. Nicholls, M. Nicholson and J. Zhu, “Cash and COVID-19: The Impact of the Pandemic on the Demand for and Use of Cash,” Bank of Canada Staff Discussion Paper No. 2020-6 (July 2020). 
     - 5 - In response to the second question, if the public does want a digital cash-like currency, some good reasons illustrate why a central bank—a trusted public institution—should issue it. Currency is a core part of the Bank’s mandate, and the integrity of our currency is a public good that all Canadians benefit from. Only a central bank can guarantee complete safety and universal access, and with public interest—not profits—as the top priority.  Let me spell out one aspect. It has been said that in the digital economy, data is the new oil. Many technology companies follow a business model in which they use their customers’ data to refine and expand the range of products and services they offer to the public. This, in turn, pulls more and more business onto their platform, which generates more data, and so on.  If that business model were used as a foundation for the dominant method of payment in the economy, the issuer would gain control over an enormous range of data—bringing with it overwhelming market power.11 In effect, a technology company could become the gatekeeper of the entire economy, with concerning implications for privacy, competition and inclusion.  Let’s compare this with a central bank digital currency. A central bank—with no commercial motivation to harvest data—is uniquely positioned to build in safeguards for privacy, while at the same time defending against criminal uses. Privacy is clearly important to Canadians, and it’s also in the public interest to protect some degree of privacy.12 Universal access would need to be another key feature of a central bank digital currency. That means ensuring that remote and marginalized communities—including but not limited to the underbanked and unbanked—are not left out of this new way to pay for goods and services.  As part of our advancing work, the Bank has been researching and experimenting with different technologies. In addition, we recently engaged three university project teams to independently develop proposals for what a digital currency ecosystem could look like. Their reports will be released tomorrow. This blue-sky thinking will help inform our research going forward. We are also carefully considering what the business model for a Canadian central bank digital currency might look like: What role would the private sector play in its development, distribution and transfer? How would this product interface with Canada’s core payments systems that transfer funds among financial institutions to settle both retail and large-scale payments?  11 J. Chiu and T.

     - 6 - Modernizing our core payments systems Long before the pandemic hit, efforts to modernize Canada’s core payments systems had already begun. This work is important, and with the rapid expansion of the digital economy accelerated by the pandemic, we can now see the benefits more clearly. Led by Payments Canada, several key players in the payments ecosystem—such as Interac, commercial banks and other stakeholders—have been working to bring these payments systems fully into the modern digital age. The Bank of Canada is heavily involved as a central bank, a regulator and, in some cases, a participant. Over the next year or so, these improvements will start to come online. This is important for Canadians because it will mean greater speed, convenience, competition and choice in how people pay for goods and services.  Right now, the fastest and most immediate money transfers we see are e-Transfers. But the new Real-Time Rail system—which will go live in 2022—will provide real-time payments beyond what is already offered through e-Transfer.  When this innovation is complete, we can imagine scenarios like these: businesses being able to pay part-time workers immediately upon completion of their shift; homebuyers putting down the deposit on their first home with a click of a button instead of physically taking a bank draft to their lawyer’s office; and governments being able to distribute emergency funds in a matter of seconds, directly into citizens’ bank accounts.  The Bank is also helping to improve other core payments systems. This includes an interbank payment system called Lynx, which will replace the current Large Value Transfer System this autumn. Lynx’s up-to-date technology includes enhanced safeguards against cyber and other risks. Another system we’re looking to improve is the one that clears cheques and other low-value payments. Improvements here will further expand consumers’ choices for convenient digital payments. Two other important developments, which I will briefly describe, will complement these changes. The first is retail payments supervision. This past August, the Bank assumed oversight responsibility for the Interac e-Transfer system under our current mandate. And the Government of Canada has announced its intention to give the Bank of Canada further oversight authority for retail payment service providers—companies that aren’t traditional banks but specialize in processing payments for the public. By ensuring that risks are well managed, the Bank, through its new supervisory role, will support confidence in payment service providers and should further encourage competition and innovation in retail payments. The second development is open banking, which will remove the barriers for banking customers to safely and easily share their financial information if they choose to engage other service providers in managing their money and other assets. Open banking will help promote greater competition and choice by allowing consumers and businesses to more easily compare the products and services various financial institutions offer.  
     - 7 - Several countries have already introduced open banking, and the federal government has launched consultations on how to implement it in Canada. This is being done to ensure that innovations are balanced with data control and privacy considerations.  We have come a long way, but more work remains. And this work takes on greater urgency as we find ourselves in an environment where the current system’s shortcomings could limit the ability of consumers and businesses to pursue the opportunities created by the digital economy. Thankfully, Canadians can look forward to significant improvements in the speed, convenience, efficiency and choice of digital payments in the near future. This is an important part of the Bank’s responsibility to promote safe, sound and efficient financial systems. Cross-border payments I’d like to turn now to the issue of cross-border payments, an area that has an obvious and pressing need for improvement. Sending money abroad has always been notoriously slow and expensive for individuals and businesses—so much so that it interferes with lives and livelihoods.  Issues with cross-border payments affect millions of Canadians. This includes new Canadians who send money to family in their country of origin. It includes snowbirds who split their time between Canada and warmer climates—although not this winter, for the most part. And it includes many Canadian businesses that face unnecessary costs and delays in paying for supplies and services from abroad or in receiving payment for the things they sell outside the country.  Beyond our borders, the issues are even more pressing for developing countries, where many individuals rely on family members abroad to send them money so they can afford basic necessities such as food, clothing and education. Many of these needs have become more acute with the uneven global impact of the pandemic. Put simply, the problems with sending money across borders create disadvantages that can prevent already impoverished people and countries from fully participating in the global economy.  In fact, these issues have been used as an argument for the creation and use of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. But there is plenty of room to improve cross-border payments without using these novel methods of payment, which would not by themselves fix the problems with cross-border payments.  As part of an initiative endorsed by the G20 and coordinated by the Financial Stability Board, the Bank of Canada and other central banks and regulators have developed a roadmap to solve some of these problems. Our main goal is to support faster and cheaper cross-border payments that are more accessible and transparent.  As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech today, we have identified numerous pain points in cross-border payments. Technological shortcomings certainly pose problems with different messaging standards in different countries. Anti-terrorism and anti–money laundering regulations—while crucial for our safety and security—can also slow the transfer of money, with multiple 
     - 8 - compliance checks. And of course, there are numerous time zones to consider. When you send money from Ottawa at noon all the way to Cambodia, the local payment system there isn’t open at midnight to process the funds.  The G20 roadmap is extensive and lays out work that several different organizations will carry out. For our part, the Bank is working with partners internationally—most notably the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures at the Bank for International Settlements. But just as important, we’re also putting the pieces in place in Canada to support the coordinated domestic effort that will be necessary to identify and address the most pressing issues from a Canadian perspective.  For all of these efforts to be successful, central banks and other authorities around the world who are working on this will need the cooperation of public and private sector partners in their own jurisdictions. Only then can we make lasting improvements to cross-border payments and ensure that people, businesses and nations around the world have the best opportunity to truly participate in the global economy. Conclusion Canadians may take our current payments ecosystem for granted because buying goods and services is already relatively simple. Long gone are the days when making a large impulse buy on a weekend was next to impossible because your bank wasn’t open for you to withdraw cash.  But that doesn’t mean there aren’t opportunities to provide Canadians with greater choice in how they pay for goods and services. Digital payment methods are integral to a truly digital economy, and can open up endless possibilities for further digital innovation. And as we all struggle with the personal, professional and economic ramifications of the pandemic, it’s even more important that the Bank move forward with this work. The Bank will continue to explore the possibilities of a digital currency that would be an electronic version of the bank notes that Canadians trust and rely on. We will issue such a currency only if and when the time is right, with the support of Canadians and the federal government, and with the best evidence in hand. We can and will make our core payments systems more effective and efficient to help consumers and businesses exchange funds in real time. And we will push forward with work to make cross-border payments cheaper, easier and safer for people around the globe to send and receive money.  Thank you again for having me, and I look forward to your questions. 
  The banking industry and the challenges of the pandemic* Spain Investors Day Pablo Hernández de Cos Governor        14.01.2021 *English translation of the original speech in Spanish  
     1  Good evening. Let me thank the Governing Board of Spain Investors Day and their President, Benito Berceruelo, for kindly inviting me to participate in the closing of the 11th edition of this annual international forum. As in previous years, it will undoubtedly contribute to enhancing Spain’s image and to promoting international investment in our country.  Allow me also a brief comment on the content of my speech. As a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB), I am today subject to the so-called “quiet period” ahead of monetary policy decision-making meetings. Therefore, my thoughts may not be interpreted as indicative of the monetary or economic outlook.  Against the background of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy, I should like to talk today about the banking industry in Spain. The industry plays a crucial role in crisis situations such as the present one by providing financing to the productive sectors and to households. And, like other sectors in the economy, it has also seen the risks it faces as a consequence of the crisis rise.  The current conjuncture has once again highlighted the importance of maintaining a healthy and resilient banking industry in the face of the various shocks that may arise.  Resilience in the banking industry should be generated before the crisis  Evidently, the improvements in the past decade in terms of balance sheet quality and solvency levels left the global and Spanish banking sector better placed to absorb the current crisis and to continue providing the financing the economy needs. Notably, the effect of the far-reaching international financial reform and, in Spain’s case, the restructuring of the sector implemented in the past decade are, along with the various economic policy measures adopted during the crisis, helping to mitigate and manage the risks generated by the pandemic.  Indeed, the financial system is so far acting as a mitigating – and not amplifying – factor of the impact of this crisis. This should be a reminder to us of the importance of having a sound banking industry shored up by prudent global regulatory standards.  Let me illustrate this with some figures. Spanish banks’ level of solvency had increased, in terms of Tier 1 capital, from €158 billion in 2007 to €215 billion just before the crisis, i.e. by just over 35%. And almost half of this total amount of capital in the sector was in the form of buffers above the regulatory minimum amount, which can, if necessary, be released as part of the prudential response to the crisis. Moreover, in the wake of the global financial crisis, mortgage lending standards have been much stricter and, in the case of loans to firms, they have been much more closely tied to their efficiency.     Likewise important from the standpoint of the industry’s resilience has been the deleveraging undergone by the Spanish non-financial private sector during this period. From 2010 to 2019 there was a decline of almost 30 pp of GDP in the household debt ratio; and in the case of the non-financial corporations sector, its net debt fell by more than 45 pp of GDP from 2010.  
     2  In any event, the most appropriate means of illustrating the banking sector’s resilience is through the stress tests we regularly perform as supervisors.  In July, the ECB conducted a vulnerability analysis of the banks under its supervision. The aim was to test, prospectively, banks’ resilience to the shock caused by the pandemic. The results of this exercise for Spanish banks are very similar to those obtained at the Banco de España in the Forward Looking Exercise on Spanish Banks (FLESB) stress test exercise, whose final results were published in our autumn Financial Stability Report. In the baseline scenario considered by the Banco de España’s vulnerability exercise, which includes cumulative declines in euro area GDP in 2020, 2021 and 2022 of around 1.6%, the reduction in the solvency of Spanish banks as a whole was estimated at 2 pp for significant institutions with an international presence, at 1 pp for other significant institutions and at 0.8 pp for institutions under the direct supervision of the Banco de España, leaving them at 9.9%, 12% and 18.7% on average, respectively, above the prudential requirements established.  Under the harshest scenario, in which Spanish GDP declines by 5.7% from 2020 to 2022, the reduction in the solvency ratio is much greater (3.9 pp for significant institutions with an international presence, 4.6 % for other significant institutions and 1.3 % for institutions under the direct supervision of the Banco de España), leaving average common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital at 8%, 8.4% and 16.6%, respectively, of risk-weighted assets.  While there is heterogeneity across banks, these results highlight, first, that banks have faced this crisis with bigger safety margins. Further, the results show the effectiveness of the measures implemented to date to mitigate the impact of the crisis.  Banking sector resilience must be maintained during the crisis  There is no room for complacency with this initial, positive diagnosis. As we all know, the scale of this shock is very high. Even given the horizon resulting from the distribution of vaccines, we know that the duration of the crisis is uncertain, as we have seen with the emergence since last autumn of fresh outbreaks of the virus practically worldwide.  To date, the crisis caused by the pandemic has considerably impacted non-financial corporations’ profits and household income, and has impaired their solvency. However, we have not seen any increase in non-performing loans, due largely to the wide range of measures the various authorities have adopted.  The ultimate impact of the crisis on the banking industry will indeed hinge on its scale and duration, but also on the effectiveness of economic policies in alleviating its effects on households and firms. In this respect, in the current situation of incomplete, uncertain and uneven economic recovery, retaining a large part of the exceptional measures to support the economy is warranted, in particular for certain sectors.  In any event, projections suggest that there will be a significant increase in the ratio of non-performing loans in the coming quarters, even under the most benign scenario.  
     3  Against this backdrop, I have three important considerations to make with a view to maintaining the sector’s resilience in the coming months, beyond keeping the extraordinary measures in place.  Firstly, much of the downturn in banks’ results in the first three quarters of 2020 was due to greater provisioning in anticipation of future asset impairment, which has still not materialised but which will do so in the coming quarters. Specifically, Spanish banks have increased their provisioning by 75% in the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period a year earlier. Sustaining this effort in the coming quarters would enable the bulk of provisioning needs anticipated by the stress tests under the most likely scenario for this and the coming year to be met.  This has led to a significant decline in banks’ profitability, but it has also raised their loss absorption capacity, something which investors should particularly value in these circumstances.  The message I wish to convey is that banks should persist with their early recognition policy, as this will enable them to continue to fulfil their task of providing funding to the economy.  It is important that banks analyse situations individually, distinguishing between temporary and more permanent effects. Automatic reclassifications that result in excessively procyclical behaviour should be avoided. However, above all, banks must be prudent, assessing provisioning needs in accordance with plausible and conservative scenarios for the coming years. In short, especially should the crisis be prolonged, banks must ensure timely and proper recognition of the effective quality impairment of their credit exposures in compliance with the supervisory guidelines. Secondly, I wish to refer to the capital buffers built up and their use during this crisis. As I mentioned earlier, solvency levels are now significantly higher than in the run-up to the global financial crisis. At the start of this crisis, prudential supervisors decided to release many macroprudential buffers – the capital, countercyclical and systemic risk buffers – and, at the same time, the microprudential authority temporarily allowed banks to operate below the level set for certain structural requirements. These decisions sought to help banks continue to provide the financing that households and firms need in such an adverse environment as the present one. Our empirical analysis shows that the use of these buffers will enable banks to provide more funding to the real economy. This in turn has a positive impact on economic growth, encouraging its recovery or moderating its decline. And this positive impact is such that it, in turn, boosts credit demand and banks’ income, which ultimately translates into higher solvency levels. In any event, it is important to note that it may be difficult for banks to use buffers if they fear they may be penalised by the financial markets for reaching certain capital ratios, which would increase their funding costs and could, therefore, affect their solvency levels. This 
     4  market stigma effect could lead banks to avoid using capital buffers, which in accordance with the above analysis would have a negative impact on the economy.1 In addition, the use of these capital buffers may be more difficult if there are doubts about how they will be rebuilt post-crisis. The difficulty would be if banks were obliged to rebuild the buffers at a time when their capacity to generate profit was only modest or when the market might not be very receptive. In this setting, clear communication by the macroprudential and microprudential authorities on the capacity to make use of these buffers and on the flexibility as to how they are subsequently rebuilt is essential. In this respect, the authorities have made it very clear that banks will have sufficient time to resume compliance with the capital requirements, and that the rebuilding process will not in any event begin until the main effects of the pandemic have been dispelled. In any event, the evidence available in the coming months on the effective use of these capital buffers, once the losses stemming from the COVID-19 crisis materialise, will be essential to allow conclusions to be drawn on the effective use of these buffers and to assess whether any additional measures may be needed. Based on the experience obtained during this crisis, and on a medium-term horizon, the balance between structural and countercyclical capital buffers could also be analysed as a way of avoiding the difficulties I have mentioned, should they arise. Thirdly, I also wish to refer to the treatment of dividends during the crisis. As you are all well aware, one of the recommendations of the European prudential supervisors, which has also been made in many other countries, is that banks should refrain from distributing dividends and be highly prudent when paying bonuses to their staff. This measure seeks to ensure that, in this highly uncertain setting, banks are able to build up sufficient funds to absorb losses. In general, all Spanish banks that were legally able to suspend or defer dividends to be distributed out of 2019 income complied with these recommendations. This enabled them to increase in 2020 the capital buffers they had already built up before the onset of the pandemic. The positive impact of this measure supplements and has been reinforced by other decisions taken by the various economic authorities, which, as I have said, have released a large part of the macroprudential buffers and have mitigated the impact of the pandemic on banks’ income statements. To date, the potentially negative side effects of these measures have been limited. Although the cost of capital for banks rose substantially with the onset of the pandemic, following the implementation of the broad raft of measures introduced to mitigate its impact this increase has been fully corrected. In addition, the recommendation to limit dividend payouts does not appear to have had a significant effect, at least in most European banking systems.                                                                                               1 Another question that hampers the use of capital buffers by banks is that, under the current regulations, if capital levels fall below certain thresholds, preventive measures are activated, such as bans on dividends and the suspension of interest payments on AT1 and T2 instruments. Once again, banks would suffer the consequent stigma on the markets where these instruments are issued. 
     5  At the end of December, the ECB and the European Systemic Risk Board reviewed the recommendation. Given the continuing uncertainty about the economic impact of the pandemic, we have recommended that banks act with extreme prudence and that they refrain from paying cash dividends and conducting share buy-backs, or that they limit such distributions until 30 September 2021. Specifically, the ECB expects dividends and share buy-backs to remain below 15% of cumulative 2019-20 profit and to be no higher than 20 basis points of the CET1 ratio, if this is lower. These measures provide more flexibility than the earlier recommendation. This is warranted by a slight decline in the macroeconomic uncertainty compared with the spring and by the fact that the core projection scenarios are close to those used in the vulnerability analysis carried out by the ECB in the first half of 2020 which, as I indicated above, confirmed the resilience of the European banking sector. In any event, a prudent approach is still required, considering that the impact of the pandemic has not yet been fully reflected in banks’ balance sheets, that banks continue to benefit from various public support measures and that credit impairment arises with a time lag. The revised recommendation aims to safeguard banks’ loss-absorbing capacity and to provide support to the economy. The recommendation will remain valid until the end of September 2021 when, provided there are no materially adverse developments, the ECB intends to lift the recommendation and return to assessing banks’ capital and dividend distribution plans based on the outcome of the normal supervisory cycle. Post-crisis, banking sector resilience is key Once the crisis comes to an end and its effects have receded, we will also need to ensure that the banking sector remains resilient, especially to any new risks that may emerge. In this regard, I wish to make a reflection on global banking regulation. The Basel reforms that were phased in over the last decade incorporated into regulations the lessons learned during the global financial crisis. The first stage of the Basel reforms began in 2010 and concluded with a second wave of reforms published in 2017. In the first phase, the aim was to boost the level and the quality of banks’ microprudential capital requirements. The intention was to reduce their risk-taking, by increasing their “skin in the game”, and to provide them with greater loss-absorbing capacity. In addition, the releasable macroprudential buffers I referred to earlier were also introduced. The second phase of the Basel reforms focused on a matter that came to light during the first phase, namely the calculation of risk-weighted assets (the denominator of the capital requirements under the Basel standards) and the need to standardise their treatment among institutions. Once again, the aim was to reinforce banks’ credibility with regard to their prudential ratios and the correct measurement of the risks they assume. A crucial aspect of this reform is the “output floor”, which limits the reductions that banks can obtain by using internal models to calculate minimum capital requirements instead of the standardised approach that does not require the use of models and is much less sensitive to new data inputs. 
     6  The impact analyses of the reform reveal that banks’ capital requirements would increase in some jurisdictions, although they would also be reduced by certain elements. Some such elements, which were to be included in the European transposition of Basel III, have already been implemented through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) quick fix, introduced in late June.2  The objectives of the Basel III reform, which consist in balancing simplicity, comparability and risk sensitivity, remain wholly in place. In this sense, after deciding to defer implementation by one year so as to increase banks’ operational capacity, all the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) members have committed to its full and consistent implementation on the new date agreed. Both the economy and the financial system will thus have sufficient time to absorb the main effects of this crisis and to gradually rebuild any buffers that may have been used.  In addition, it should be noted that the BCBS is carefully assessing the impact of the reforms, including the lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis. This analysis, based on rigorous empirical evidence, will serve to determine whether any additional regulatory aspects need addressing. Further, it will be important to respond to any new risks that may emerge.  At present, it is clear that the profound technological changes taking place in the financial sector bring new risks, such as those of cyberattacks or reliance on external service providers.  These technological developments may also eventually give rise to significant changes in the financial services value chain, for example, by increasing the importance of technology firms. These firms – the big techs – possess an enormous amount of customer data, and they make highly effective use of those data for their own ends. Recent experience shows that these firms have caused disruption in the sectors they have entered, taking over the most profitable business segments and supplanting existing firms.    These developments have major implications for supervisors and regulators. First, proactive supervision must be the primary response to these changes, as the traditional regulatory framework may not be sufficient. Second, we should give consideration to the regulatory perimeter to ensure that the oft-cited mantra of ‘same activities, same risks, same rules” actually applies. And third, cooperation among different authorities will be essential, given the diversity of the sectors and issues potentially affected by these technological innovations. In this regard, customer data governance is a fundamental issue which we will need to reflect upon at great length. If it is deemed necessary for such data to be made available to all operators, then it seems reasonable that there should be no exceptions to the obligation to make it available and that the precise extent of this obligation should be clear. That said,                                                                                               2 In particular, the impact of the SME and infrastructure supporting factors is reflected in the recent behaviour of solvency ratios. The effect of the exemption of software-related intangible investments from capital deductions will become evident at a later date.   
     7  individual incentives to collect and manage such information must not be undermined and customers’ rights must be respected.    Mention should also be made of the new risks arising from the transition to a more sustainable economy. It is crucial that the sector should incorporate into its decision-making process climate change-associated risks, physical and transition-related alike. And we supervisors must ensure that banks correctly price the risks associated with climate change and incorporate them into their portfolio management. Many supervisors (including the Banco de España) are developing environmental stress tests to be introduced in the coming years. Their aim is to simulate the consequences for financial institutions of different hypothetical scenarios entailing changes in the structure of the economy.  I would also like to reflect on what I consider to be one of the main challenges for the banking sector in the short, medium and long term, namely the low profitability of the banking business. It was already low in many European countries before the coronavirus crisis, but the present crisis will put it under further pressure.  To address this challenge, it is essential for banks to continue to make efficiency gains, by cutting costs and making more use of new technologies.  Consolidation in the sector could be an appropriate way to achieve this aim. Specifically, there appears to be room for consolidation both in Spain and in other European jurisdictions where the indicators point to some surplus capacity. Naturally, such processes are the responsibility of banks’ owners, while our role, as banking supervisors, is to analyse any merger plans submitted to us from the standpoint of business viability. This entails assessing the solvency of the resulting institution, analysing the impact on overall financial stability and overseeing the execution of the merger to ensure that the potential synergies are indeed harnessed.  Transnational European mergers would be particularly positive. They would deepen the Banking Union, reduce the sovereign-bank risk nexus, and provide greater potential for diversification. They would also help establish broader customer bases, so that the cost of investment in technology could be more widely distributed, although the immediate impact on cost-cutting would be more limited. In this respect, the ECB Guide on the supervisory approach to consolidation in the banking sector aims precisely to provide the market with greater predictability of supervisory actions, to help banks design merger plans that are sound from a prudential standpoint and ensure that the resulting institution has a business plan that, when executed correctly, will add value. However, banks should also seek to enhance their efficiency by improving the use they make of the information they hold. This requires significant investment in digitalisation and also the incorporation of new data processing technologies to allow them to change their business model while controlling their risk profile. And this is why it is so important that the “quick fix” has brought European prudential regulations on this kind of investment much closer in line with those already in place in the United States and Switzerland. 
     8  Investments of this kind would enable banks to face up to any major potential competitors –not necessarily financial institutions– that might venture into the credit market with greater guarantees of success.  Allow me to end this address with a final reflection on the need to persevere with a European response to this crisis in the financial sphere as well.  The response from the prudential authorities, along with the monetary and fiscal policy measures adopted, has so far enabled the initial impact of the shock to be absorbed and prevented the materialisation of a systemic risk in the financial system that would have further exacerbated the crisis and made it more persistent.  However, some of the shortcomings that continue to exist have also been revealed. In this respect, the completion of the Banking Union with the approval of a fully mutualised European deposit insurance scheme would make a decisive contribution to ensuring financial stability in the euro area, both over the coming months and in the medium term. Further deepening of the Capital Markets Union project is also essential. Moreover, priority must be given to analysing how appropriate the European resolution and winding-up regulations are for a hypothetical systemic crisis, and the possible role of asset management companies in the event of severe impairment of European financial institutions’ balance sheets.  To sum up, if we are to continue to address this crisis effectively, persevering with a European response - in the financial sphere as well - is essential.  Thank you very much.    
Vitas Vasiliauskas: Introductory remarks - Cyprus Annual BankingConference and FinTech EXPOIntroductory remarks by Mr Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, atthe Cyprus Annual Banking Conference and FinTech EXPO, 15 January 2021.*   *   *Good morning, dear listeners, fellow Governors,I would like to thank the Governors for their insights in this panel, and also the organisers of theconference for inviting me.Discussing the role of banks in the time of COVID-19 is indeed vital. Banking is as important tothe economy as the heart is to the human body.And just like cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of mortality in Europe,diseases of the banking sector often stand behind the deepest crises in our history. In 1930s, theGreat Depression was significantly amplified by bank runs. In 2008, subprime mortgage loansextended by banks created the US housing bubble that brought down the entire global financialsystem. In Europe, a heavily bank-based system, the infamous sovereign-bank nexus resulted ina prolonged European sovereign debt crisis.The COVID-19 crisis was not, of course, caused by the banking system. But it could have greatlyamplified the shock if it was not resilient enough. Moreover, a weak banking system woulddiminish prospects of a sustained recovery.This is why the role of banks is so critical in the current context. In this light, I would like to makethree points in my brief intervention:• First, we learnt our lessons from the previous crisis – and this contributed to banks’ resilienceduring the current one.• Second, swift regulatory responses to such shocks as COVID-19 can further help the bankingsystem support the shaken economy.• And third, a truly sustainable long-term economic recovery after this crisis depends on solvingequally long-term issues in the European banking system.Let us begin with the resilience of banks which has so far prevented a health crisis from turninginto a full-blown systemic financial crisis. The Basel III reforms made sure that the global bankingsystem was significantly better capitalised than at the onset of the global financial crisis. TheCommon Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio in the EU banking sector – a key indicator of financialsoundness – rose from 9% in 2009 to nearly 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019, before theCOVID-19 crisis hit. With this amount of capital, banks can generally continue their lending to theeconomy even if truly adverse scenarios materialise, as shown by the ECB’s vulnerabilityanalysis published in July 2020.This shows that in the field of banking regulation, we did not waste the previous crisis and learntour lessons well.My second point relates to regulatory response. The relief package that the ECB BankingSupervision announced in March was designed to ensure that banks can keep lending to thecontracting economy. For instance, banks were allowed to temporarily operate below the level ofcapital defined by the bank-specific Pillar 2 capital requirements, namely Pillar II guidance. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
In Lithuania, macroprudential policy was a key domain of the regulatory response package. Priorto 2020, critics would say that our macroprudential set-up was perhaps too wide-ranging. Butthis crisis showed, I believe, that our policy stance was the right one.First, it helped prevent a deterioration in lending standards and a build-up of systemic risk in therun up to the COVID-19 shock. And second, when the time came, we implemented counter-cyclical policy decisions in line with the intended functioning of the framework. For instance, inmid-March, the Bank of Lithuania fully released the counter-cyclical capital buffer from 1% to 0%.Overall, the relaxation of various requirements has increased the lending potential of banks inLithuania by €2 billion, or by a third, compared to 2019. Of course, we are talking about potentialhere, not the real world. But the real-world data has been encouraging, at least in terms oflending to households, which has broadly returned to the pre-pandemic levels.Going forward, policymakers should not “waste a good crisis” this time as well, and take a freshlook at the existing macroprudential framework. We could even consider novel ways of applyingmacroprudential tools – such as the application of borrower-based measures during the cycle,e.g. relaxing the loan-to-value or debt-service-to-income requirements in times of crisis.Finally, I would like to make a point on the long-term issues of the European banking sector. Thefirst issue here is inadequate bank profitability. In this regard, there is a need for consolidation viamergers and acquisitions to make the European banking sector leaner. Completing the BankingUnion by creating a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS) would open doors for truecross border consolidation in Europe.The second issue is non-performing loans (NPLs) – a long-standing problem in the Europeanbanking sector. To tackle the potential rise in NPLs, the next round of government support shouldput more emphasis on solvency rather than liquidity support. In my opinion, the EU should returnto the idea of establishing a European Solvency Support Instrument. There is also a great needof convergence of various insolvency frameworks across the Member States.Tackling these issues would allow banks to keep lending for a sustained recovery.Thank you for your attention!   2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
         Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) 2019 - 20 Financial Review of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand    Governor’s opening statement  Date: 10 February 2021          
 2  Page 2 of 9  Tēnā koutou katoa, welcome all. It is a privilege to be here with you today – alongside the rest of the Bank’s Senior Leadership Team – to report on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s achievements, challenges, and opportunities on what has been an extraordinary and unprecedented year.  Like many organisations and businesses, we, at Te Pūtea Matua, have had to change our way of working, refocus our priorities, and take necessary actions to continue to support cashflow and confidence among New Zealanders during the tough times.   The experience of the past year has brought forward new challenges, risks, and opportunities for us. While our priorities in the recent (2019-20) financial year have been focused significantly on supporting New Zealand’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also continued our work on a wide range of initiatives, including:   Working with The Treasury to have the new Reserve Bank of New Zealand Bill introduced to Parliament;   Agreeing to a new Funding Agreement with the Minister of Finance;   Working closely with our fellow Council of Financial Regulators (CoFR) members to manage and co-ordinate regulatory work;    Launching a new payment settlement system;  Progressing our Te Ao Māori strategy; and  Managing climate risks to our financial system, among others. At the end of June last year – New Zealand looked and felt quite different to what it does some eight months later. We’d just entered Level 1 – activity was starting to pick up, sporting events and larger gatherings were going ahead and we were all finding our ‘new normal’. But - there was so much uncertainty about how the global pandemic would continue to unfold, and what responses would be needed.  While we’ve got more information to work from now, and global policy responses are clearer, we still continue to learn and adapt. We are committed to responding to challenges and progressing initiatives that will ensure we remain an active, relevant cornerstone of New Zealand’s economy and society.  
 3  Page 3 of 9  I thank my Board, my colleagues and our people for their dedication, hard work, flexibility, and assistance.  Let me take you through some of the initiatives we have worked on in the past year:   Responding to the COVID-19 pandemic  Early in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began unfolding, we acted quickly and in tandem with the Government to keep our financial system stable, and cushion the economic blow to households and businesses from this unprecedented event. Since then, we have delivered a broad range of activities to ensure cash-flow in the economy and ensure that the financial sector is well positioned to meet the needs of New Zealanders, including:   Easing monetary conditions by keeping interest rates low to build confidence and enable cheaper lending for businesses and households. Our Official Cash Rate is has been at 0.25% since March 2020;  Developing and deploying a full set of alternative monetary policy tools – which includes the Large Scale Assets Purchases (LSAP) programme and the Funding for Lending program –  to support inflation and employment;   Reprioritising the regulatory reform landscape so financial service participants can focus on supporting customers’ needs; and   Helping the Government roll out the mortgage payment deferrals and business finance guarantee schemes.  All of these actions are driven by our mandate, focused on supporting the economy to achieve our mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. Having entered the pandemic with a low level of pre-existing debt and a strong economic position at that time, we were well placed to respond to the crisis. New Zealand is now in a privileged position of having successfully contained the virus and with many parts of the economy back up and running.  But the economic shock from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Although recovery is now underway, it will be a lengthy and difficult process but we are well prepared for this challenge and we stand ready to provide stability and support.  
 4  Page 4 of 9  You will hear more from us about this when we discuss our next Monetary Policy Statement, due for release on the 24th of February. On this note, I would like to recognise the Monetary Policy Committee members, whose collective decisions have been instrumental in our COVID-19 response.  Payments Systems Replacement  One of the major projects that we have delivered in the 2019/20 financial year was a new payment settlement system. In February 2020, we went live with a new future-proofed payment settlement platform, launching two separate systems – ESAS 2.0 and NZClear 2.0 – replacing a 20-year-old inter-bank settlement system and central securities depository. This is an integral part of our commitment to enhance our payments systems’ resilience and establish a more modern and secure platform for future development. With New Zealand being a highly financially digitised economy, these two new systems are critical infrastructure to our financial system, allowing every New Zealander and major institutions to go about their daily lives settling their financial obligations with integrity and confidence.  The project was the most complex technology switch that our Payments and Settlements group had ever undertaken. The scope was unprecedented as we simultaneously replaced both the country’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and Central Security Depository (CSD) systems which is unheard of for a modern economy. No material issues arose during the go-live. In fact - weeks after the launch, COVID hit putting enormous pressure on the economy and our markets, but we had confidence in the integrity of our newly-launched system, knowing that we had prepared our members, our staff, all our processes and technology well to handle unprecedented volumes with ease. Transformation and change Looking to the future now, and we are navigating through a period of change and transformation at the Bank as we await the enactment of the new Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act – the legislation that underpins our purpose and how we operate. 
 5  Page 5 of 9  Since 2018, we have been jointly working with The Treasury to see the new Reserve Bank of New Zealand Bill introduced to Parliament in July last year.  We are incredibly excited with the foundational opportunity we have through the new legislation to fully modernise and empower New Zealand’s central bank. The implementation of the new Reserve Bank Act will enable us to be fit for purpose and to undertake the considerable transformation that will allow us to continue to effectively and consistently deliver on our mandate. Other major legislative changes are also underway which will strengthen our prudential regulation and supervisory powers:  The Deposit Takers Act will modernise, strengthen, and unify our regulatory framework for all deposit-takers;  The review of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act (IPSA). Last year we have launched a dual consultation on the scope of the IPSA and associated Insurer Solvency Standards;  The Financial Markets Infrastructure Bill will establish a new regulatory regime for FMIs that will be jointly administered by the Bank and the Financial Markets Authority.  Our funding  Part of our transformation is ensuring that we have the adequate resources to meet our increasing responsibilities and the expectations of New Zealanders. In the financial year 2019/20, we agreed a new funding agreement for the period 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025 with the Minister of Finance. Prior to this new funding agreement, we are pleased to report that we completed the previous five-year funding agreement on target despite the challenges we’ve encountered over that period, including the relocation to temporary office premises due to asbestos remediation work, review of the Reserve Bank Act, and the reform of major systems.  Additionally, in 2019/20, COVID-19 created an extraordinary high demand for banknotes resulting in the Bank exceeding the net operating expenses specified under the funding agreement. The excess cost is expected to largely reverse at some stage as we expect the bulk of the growth in banknote volumes issued to be repatriated. 
 6  Page 6 of 9  Our new funding agreement accounts for additional investment to ensure we operate as a Great Team, Best Central Bank. The increase in funding means we are able to address the critical risks to delivering our mandate, respond to areas of past underinvestment, and establish a long-term model to promote the wellbeing of New Zealand. We are committed to managing our resources effectively and measuring our delivery on the priorities we’ve set.  Diversity and Inclusion  As Aotearoa New Zealand’s central bank, we need to ensure that we drive economic wellbeing for all New Zealanders. In our capacity as a Council of Financial Regulator member and with our own Te Ao Māori strategy, we are harnessing diversity and financial inclusion, and collaborating to better understand the economy.  In particular, we continue to embed our Te Ao Māori strategy across our work at the Bank and with our stakeholders.  Most recently, we have released Te Ōhanga Māori, a report on the Māori economy, in partnership with Business and Economic Research Ltd (BERL). Understanding how the Māori culture and how Māori businesses operate, gives us a richer insight into their important contribution to and impacts on the New Zealand economy. This research will form the basis of ongoing engagement over the coming years as we look to better understand the perspective of the Māori economy.  Internationally, we have initiated a series of virtual global discussion with our central bank colleagues in Canada, the United States, and Australia on building a collective, foundational understanding on indigenous histories and economics.  Work is also underway to translate the key metrics of our Financial Strength Dashboard into Te Reo Māori.  Internally, we have a Diversity and Inclusion Working Group, in charge of a work programme to increase awareness of diversity and inclusion and further improve gender and ethnic diversity at the Bank over time. Last year, for the first time, we joined the Tupu Tai Pasifika Public Sector Internship Programme, offering a paid 11-week summer internship to Pasifika tertiary students and recent graduates.    
 7  Page 7 of 9  Housing, LVRs and the Reserve Bank’s role While we are proud of what we have accomplished in the past financial year, there is more to do and we are still doing the hard yards to ensure the wellbeing of all New Zealanders.  We recognise that housing affordability is an important issue for New Zealand – as a nation, but also for many people on a personal level. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the levers we have used to help maintain credit flows and to support the mortgage deferral scheme was to remove loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions. LVR restrictions are used to put a limit into banks’ mortgage lending to borrowers that are highly-leveraged.  We removed LVR restrictions so as they didn’t impede COVID-19 responses and policies to promote cashflow and confidence in the system. Since then, the domestic economy has seen a strong recovery, the housing market has proved resilient, and high-LVR lending has been increasing.   We are concerned about the risk of sharp correction in the housing market and the harm this could do. If continued, this could lead to emerging risks to financial stability.  And so in December last year, we launched a public consultation proposing to reinstate LVR restrictions. Yesterday we announced our decision to put in place firmer LVR restrictions to reduce the risks to financial stability caused by higher-risk mortgage lending. From 1 March 2021, LVR restrictions will be reinstated at the same level they were set at prior to the onset of COVID-19, with a further tightening of restrictions taking effect on 1 May 2021.  We’ve also made it clear we expect banks to respect the tighter investor restrictions immediately with all new loan approvals, to ensure that their mortgage lending is consistent with our policy decision.  While a broader set of policy measures is needed to address long-term imbalances in the housing market, the Reserve Bank is acting on its mandate to control financial stability risks resulting from excessive high risk borrowing.   As you are aware, last year, we received a letter from the Minister of Finance seeking our views on ways we can work together to address rising house prices. We have since provided detailed feedback on the comments raised by the Minister in his letter. 
 8  Page 8 of 9  This is an important topic for all New Zealanders and we remain committed to engaging with the Minister to utilise the unique role of the Reserve Bank in relation to the complex and multifaceted drivers of housing market. This is a collective challenge. Solutions to any identified problem of high house prices or housing affordability require the involvement of many government portfolios and agencies, as well as non-government participants.  Data Breach  A significant challenge that we continue to respond to is the malicious attack of a third party file system used by the Bank. The Bank was not the target of the attack – other Accellion FTA users around the world have also been affected.  We had no warning to avoid the attack which began in mid-December. Accellion failed to notify us for five days that an attack was occurring against its customers, and that a patch was available that would have prevented this breach. If we were notified at the appropriate time, we could have patched the system and avoided the breach.  Our own analysis has identified shortcomings in our processes once the system was breached. The impact this had is part of the review underway. While we will continue to be as transparent as possible, we need to be mindful not to jeopardise the criminal and forensic investigations and reviews underway.  We’ve have had teams working, at times around the clock, to respond to this breach. We have completed our assessment of the files illegally downloaded during the breach and we are notifying organisations involved. External legal advisers are also providing assurance checks and advice on any personal information which was included in the downloaded files. We are working closely with the organisations affected. As part of this support, we have engaged IDCare - a specialist national identity and cyber support service providing counselling and advice to people and organisations. This support will be provided at no cost to them. 
 9  Page 9 of 9  We can’t undo the breach, but we can make sure that anyone affected gets the support and help they need. Conclusion While some of our work at the Bank has been tested through these tough times, I want to say that I am proud of what everyone at the Bank – our Board, our leadership team, our Monetary Policy Committee and our people – have delivered for the benefit of all New Zealanders.   The challenges we have experienced have reinforced the importance of identifying and managing risks, working collectively and collaboratively, and adapting to necessary changes.   I am confident that we have a strong and capable team at the Bank committed to taking a long-term and sustainable approach to economic recovery and resilience. We stand ready to do everything that we can to be better kaitakiti of New Zealand’s financial system.  Thank you.

First, let me take this opportunity to wish everyone a HappyNew Year!  Let me also thank the Asia Securities Industry & Financial Markets Association(ASIFMA) and the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) for organising this webinar andinviting me to speak on the important issue of Singapore’s interest rate benchmarktransition.2      In the next 20 mins or so, I will do a brief recap of the key objectives and milestones thatwe had set out last year.  I will then touch on some recent developments in the US and UKthat have a bearing on our transition timelines, and I will finally outline what our prioritiesare for this year in the transition to Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA).Recap3      Back in 2019, the financial industry in Singapore, represented by the ABS and theSingapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee (SFEMC)  , assessed that given theeventual discontinuation of USD London Interbank Oﬀered Rate (LIBOR) and SGD Swap OﬀerRate (SOR), the most sustainable and sensible path was to transition aﬀected SOR marketsto SORA. SORA is a robust interest rate benchmark underpinned by transactions in a deep andliquid overnight interbank funding market.Such a shi  would be aligned to the global direction in other major financial centres, andsupport continued active participation of global institutions and investors in SGDmarkets. [1]
12/02/2021"Pushing Ahead with SOR-SORA Transition in 2021" - Keynote Speech by Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/pushing-ahead-with-sor-sora-transition-in-20212/74      This transition eﬀort was always going to be a complex task, and a strong public-privatepartnership was needed to address the wide-ranging implications across multiple industrystakeholders, in order to achieve a smooth transition. To this end, the Monetary Authority ofSingapore (MAS) established an industry-led Steering Committee (or SC-STS  ) to providestrategic direction to develop new products and markets based on SORA and oversee theeﬀective transition from SOR to SORA.5      Since then, we have made significant strides in developing SORA markets, even whiletackling the challenges and disruptions from the ongoing pandemic. In the derivatives space, new market templates were developed to support the trading ofSORA derivatives. LCH started the central clearing of SORA derivatives early last year upto the 5Y tenor, while key dealer banks started making markets in SORA derivatives.MAS also launched a daily SORA derivatives auction to facilitate price discovery, anddevelop SORA Overnight Index Swap (OIS) and SOR-SORA basis curves with prices quotedby dealers and brokers on key market data platforms. Trading volumes in SORAderivatives have continued to rise, doubling in the last quarter, albeit from a low base.In the cash market, adoption of SORA has broadened significantly. We have seen severalsizeable SORA-based commercial loans involving early pathfinders such as CapitaLand,Olam, Wilmar and Sembcorp Industries.  Our local banks have also launched severalbusiness and retail SORA property loan product oﬀerings.Given the strong interest in SORA products, and progress made in kickstarting SORAmarket liquidity, SC-STS also announced that usage of SOR in new cash products willcease by April 2021. To support this, our key retail banks will lead the way by oﬀering abroad suite of SORA products by end-February 2021.  Other banks active in SGD retail andcorporate loans will follow suit by April 2021.Another significant development last year, was the industry decision to discontinueSIBOR by end-2024  , to reap the expected benefits of enhanced market eﬀiciency in aSORA-centered interest rate benchmark regime.Implications of Recent ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) Announcement6      Let me now touch on what many of you in the audience would consider the ‘elephant inthe room’.  In December 2020, the IBA – or ICE Benchmark Administration, consulted onLIBOR discontinuation timelines across various currency settings. What caught most of ourattention, was the proposed 18-month extension till 30 June 2023 of the widely referencedUSD LIBOR tenors (the overnight, 1M, 3M, 6M and 12M). [2][3][4]
12/02/2021"Pushing Ahead with SOR-SORA Transition in 2021" - Keynote Speech by Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/pushing-ahead-with-sor-sora-transition-in-20213/77      The overarching policy intent of the extended end-date has been made clear in thecommentaries from authorities in the US and UK. The proposed extension will allow moretime for the transition of legacy contracts, while the usage of LIBOR in new contracts is tocease as soon as possible.8      US regulatory agencies  have stated that the use of USD LIBOR in new contracts a er31 December 2021 would create safety and soundness risks, and this should cease as soonas practicable and latest by end-2021. In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority will beconsulting on an approach to prohibit some or all new use of LIBOR a er end-2021. Thiswould likely be coordinated with similar measures across other key jurisdictions. 9      All these suggest that a er end-2021, new cash and derivatives contracts in thesecurrencies will predominantly reference overnight near risk-free rates (RFRs), while LIBORmarkets will decline in liquidity.10      So what does this mean for our SGD benchmark transition eﬀorts? Key priorities for the SC-STS11      The SC-STS has reviewed its key priorities and timelines against these developmentsand will be publishing later today an updated Transition Roadmap for 2021/2022. 12      While we recognise that there could be further changes pending the finalisation of IBA’sproposal, there was broad consensus within the Committee that we should keep building onthe strong momentum generated over the past year. Let me share with you four keytakeaways of the SC-STS, arising from these latest developments. 13      First, the proposed extension of LIBOR discontinuation means that SOR will endwhen LIBOR ends in mid-2023. This has two benefits:  One, it will allow about 70% ofexisting stock of legacy SOR cash products  or about S$65bn of bilateral and syndicatedloans to mature before the new deadline. This is a good development, as financialinstitutions will have a smaller stock of legacy transactions to manage. Two, the extensionprovides time to do more to actively transition legacy SOR contracts to SORA, and to dealwith the most challenging legacy transition issues. We seek to complete this transition as anindustry by no later than end-2022.     Stopping new use early14      Second, it must still be the case that we stop adding to legacy SOR exposures assoon as practicable.  Hence:There was unanimous support within the SC-STS to cease the use of SOR in new cashmarket products by April 2021, as originally announced.      [5][6][7]
12/02/2021"Pushing Ahead with SOR-SORA Transition in 2021" - Keynote Speech by Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/pushing-ahead-with-sor-sora-transition-in-20214/7In addition, the Committee is considering the need to set a clear timeline, possiblysometime in 2H 2021, to cease the use of SOR in new derivatives transactions, exceptwhere strictly necessary for risk management and unwinding of legacy SOR exposures.This timeline will support a more coordinated shi  to SORA among key derivativesmarket participants. This will also align our market with similar timelines beingcontemplated for stopping new LIBOR transactions in other key jurisdictions. SC-STS expects to share its guidance in the coming months a er incorporating feedbackfrom market participants.Related to this, the Committee had previously announced in December 2020  , that itplans to set out guidance on timelines to cease the use of SIBOR in new loan contracts in2021.  This will likewise be finalised in the coming months. 15      Taken together, we expect SOR, SIBOR and LIBOR activities to wind down towards theend of this year. This in turn, will generate a growing critical mass in new SORA-based cashmarket activity, and spur greater market eﬀiciency and liquidity.Developing a robust SORA curve16      Third, the Committee and MAS will take further steps to develop a robust SORAcurve, to reinforce the shi  to a SORA-centered regime.  We will do so by undertakingseveral key initiatives in the first half of 2021.To establish a robust SORA curve, SC-STS is coordinating closely with LCH to extendcentral clearing for SORA derivatives from 5Y currently to 21Y in the coming months. Thiswill mitigate counterparty credit risks and support higher SORA transaction volumes andmarket activity across the longer tenors.Similarly, MAS will also extend the tenors and broaden industry participation in our SORAprice discovery auctions. Since its launch in June last year, the number of participants inthe auctions has doubled from six to twelve major banks. This has facilitated pricediscovery in SORA derivatives up to the 5Y tenor. Given the positive outcome, MAS willextend the tenors of the SORA auctions to 20Y from 1 March 2021. We expect the bid-askspreads for SORA OIS and SOR-SORA basis swaps at the longer end of the curve to tightenfurther with these enhancements.To further enhance market depth, MAS will expand our SORA Floating Rate Notes (FRN)programme. This was launched in August last year, and has met with strong investordemand, with outstanding size growing to S$5.3 billion in only 6 months.  Looking ahead,we will extend the tenors from 6 months to 1 year and 2 years in the first half of this year.The 1-year tenor will be issued quarterly while the 2-year tenor will be issued semi-annually. We will also gradually increase the issuance sizes if investor demand continuesto be strong.[8]
12/02/2021"Pushing Ahead with SOR-SORA Transition in 2021" - Keynote Speech by Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/pushing-ahead-with-sor-sora-transition-in-20215/7Encouraging active transition17      Fourth, notwithstanding the possible discontinuation of SOR in mid-2023, we willstrongly encourage active transition from SOR to SORA during the second half of thisyear.  This is a specific window where we expect both SOR and SORA markets to continue tobe liquid, and transition from SOR to SORA will be the most conducive for marketparticipants.  There are two key aspects.18      On derivatives, key banks remain committed to winding down the bulk of their SORexposures by end-Q3 2021, as announced by SC-STS last October. This will involve active participation in vendor-provided compression and conversionservices, to reduce SOR exposures at an industry level. Broadly speaking, thecompression exercises facilitate the multilateral netting or reduction of gross SORderivatives exposures, while conversion cycles provide a multilateral mechanism forcounterparties to convert their SOR derivatives to a SORA reference.This is already in progress. The first SGD compression cycle for this year will be held thisweek. SC-STS plans to publish an advance calendar of the relevant SOR compression andconversion cycles in 2021, oﬀered by various vendors. SC-STS strongly urges all SORderivatives participants to utilise these cycles. Having a critical mass of industryparticipants will enhance the multilateral netting eﬀects and put the industry in astronger position to meet its wind-down targets.19      For loan markets, SC-STS will publish by April 2021 market guidance on the transitionof bilateral corporate and retail loans, and set out further guidance on market mechanismsfor converting legacy syndicated and hedged loans by the third quarter of this year.  This isexpected to rely on active SOR to SORA transition in the derivatives market to establishrelevant pricing references for the transition of syndicated and hedged loans, wherecoordination across lenders and borrowers is essential.20      The key message is this: Banks should actively engage their corporate customers topro-actively undertake legacy transition wherever possible by end 2021. While somecustomers may be inclined to adopt a wait and see approach, particularly since LIBOR andSOR discontinuation could be extended to mid 2023, it is important to bear in mind that SORderivatives liquidity will start to decline in 2021. 21      There are two reasons for this: Liquidity in derivatives will start shi ing to SORA, particularly from April onwards, giventhe stop to new SOR cash products, and as all hedges on new cash product shi  to SORA.Likewise, with SC-STS considering a cessation timeline for new SOR derivatives, likelybefore end-2021, market participants should expect SOR liquidity to decline further as
12/02/2021"Pushing Ahead with SOR-SORA Transition in 2021" - Keynote Speech by Mr Leong Sing Chiong, Deputy Managing Director (Markets …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/pushing-ahead-with-sor-sora-transition-in-20216/7key banks will not be able to undertake new SOR derivatives transactions.  22      It is hard to say for certain when SORA liquidity will exceed SOR liquidity. But based onour planning parameters, it is likely that the ‘sweet spot’ for active transition could bebetween mid 2021 to early part of 2022, when SORA markets would have deepenedsuﬀiciently while SOR derivative liquidity still exists before declining subsequently. Thisperiod of trading will provide the most robust SOR-to-SORA pricing references for transitionof legacy contracts.23      One final word, pertaining to retail loans.  Retail customers that are on SOR packageswill need to transition as well. The SC-STS will be embarking on a media campaign in 2Q2021 to educate the wider public of this important shi . Retail investors with SOR exposuresshould be hearing from their banks over the course of this year and next, on the optionsregarding their loan packages.Conclusion24      In conclusion, as we enter into 2021, I am glad that we are starting the year with somegood news – that with the IBA consultation, we are likely to have more time to managelegacy transition.  Nevertheless, it is important to use this extra time wisely, and sequenceour legacy transition activities deliberately and purposefully.25      From SC-STS’ point of view, we have made much progress last year in laying thefoundations for the transition.  For this year, we want to maintain our strong momentum,and achieve good depth and liquidity for SORA markets by the middle of the year. Fromthere, I strongly urge banks to work with your customers to take advantage of the goodliquidity in both SOR and SORA markets in the next 6-12 months to proactively transitionlegacy contracts. 26      If we manage to front load this work early and transition the substantive bulk of legacybooks by early 2022, this will leave ample time for us to deal with any residual tough legacytransactions.  That would be a good place to be in, when we meet again this time next year.27      Thank you very much, I wish you all fruitful discussions for the rest of this webinar.***   The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) is a non-profit organisation that represents the interestsof the commercial and investment banking community.

Benjamin E Diokno: Opening remarks - Tuesday Club Press EventOpening remarks by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, thecentral bank of the Philippines), at the Tuesday Club Press Event, 4 January 2021.*   *   *Good morning, officers and members of the Tuesday Club!It has become a tradition for us at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas to spend our first Tuesday ofthe year with you.2020 was an extraordinary year because of the COVID-19 pandemic which, by the way, is morethan a health crisis, as the country also felt its debilitating impact on lives, livelihoods, andinequality.But this once-in-a-lifetime crisis, it is unlike other crises we have faced in the past.Previous economic crises in the Philippines had always been accompanied by rising interestrates and a weakening peso.The Central Bank of the Philippines—the BSP’s predecessor— deliberately raised interest ratesto contain peso depreciation and control inflation. But it was different this time for two mainreasons.First, the Philippines was in a position of strength when the pandemic hit us. The Philippines’sstrong macroeconomic fundamentals prior to the pandemic—manageable inflation, a strong andresilient banking system, a prudent fiscal position, and a hefty level of gross internationalreserves—cushioned the economy from the impact of the crisis.Second, the BSP was among the central banks in the world that immediately responded to thecrisis by deploying a set of comprehensive measures.The Monetary Board cut the policy rate by 200 basis points and the reserve requirement byanother 200 basis points.As a result of this bold, timely, and decisive action, the country’s interest rates hit a historic low.To calm the market and inject liquidity into the system, we also adopted a wide range ofmeasures that deployed almost two trillion pesos, equivalent to about 10 percent of the 2019GDP.The peso appreciated by approximately 5.67 percent—from P50.74 to the US dollar as of end2019 to its current rate at P48.021.As of end November 2020, the country’s gross international reserves, or GIR, hit an all-time highof US$105 billion, which is three times the import requirements of the country.In addition, the peso was supported by the gradual recovery in external accounts such as foreigndirect investments (FDI) and overseas Filipino remittances.It also helped that the Philippines received its highest credit ratings in history before thepandemic began.Such favorable assessment enabled the country to access financing with low-interest rates anda long repayment period. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
We are continuously receiving affirmation and even upgrades from international rating agencies.In February 2020, R&I upgraded the Philippines’ credit rating from “BBB” to “BBB+” with a “stableoutlook.”  In May, Fitch Ratings and S&P Global affirmed the Philippines’ credit rating of “BBB” and “BBB+”respectively.In June, Japan Credit Rating Agency upgraded Philippine sovereign debt to A- (Stable), citingstrong economic fundamentals.And in July, Moody’s affirmed the Philippines’ “Baa2” rating with a “stable” outlook.The BSP has also worked hand in hand with the country’s economic team and the Congress onmandating grace periods for debt payments in May and September.We likewise made loans to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) count against banks’reserve requirement ratio (RRR).This move directed capital to this important sector that employs two-thirds of Filipino workers’and increased the volume of loans to MSMEs by almost 1,400 percent from April to November2020.Speaking of banks, the country’s banking sector entered the crisis with adequate capital.The average capital adequacy ratio hovers in the 15 percent territory, higher than the BSP’sminimum requirement of 10 percent and the 8 percent prescribed by the Bank for InternationalSettlements.Bad debts remain manageable, with the non-performing loans (NPLs) of banks settling at 3.7percent as of October 2020.Embracing digitalization and financial technology has helped most of us adapt to these changingand challenging times.Even before the pandemic, the BSP actively promoted financial technology and the shift todigitalization.The fruits of this advocacy have become a survival tool during the lockdown and enabled us tocontinue with our transactions within the safety of our homes.Hard macro and micro economic data suggest that the worst is behind us.Based on available information, we expect the economy to bounce back by 6.5 to 7.5 percentnext year.With the further easing of restrictions, improvements in the healthcare system, and the fullcooperation from each one of us to do what it takes to keep viral transmission under control, thisgrowth target is easily attainable.With the expanding economic activity, we are also expecting the unemployment rate to fall from arecord-high 17.6 percent in April—the height of the lockdown—to 7 percent in 2021.Indeed, deep into the pandemic and even during the strictest part of the lockdown, we haveexhibited fortitude and resilience as individuals and as a nation.But resilience is not enough. We must collect and harness significant lessons from thisexperience, so when we find ourselves in a similar situation in the future, we will be moreprepared and know exactly what to do. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
We ought to keep in mind that famous quote: tough times don’t last; tough people do.Finally, as with any other significant disruption in our history, it is my fervent hope that this crisiswill usher in a new economy—one that is more robust, more inclusive, more technologically-savvy.As soon as this pandemic fades, I expect that the Philippines to become nothing less than aneconomic champion.Thank you very much and cheers to a promising and bright 2021! 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Benjamin E Diokno: The Philippines - seizing opportunities for abetter tomorrowSpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at “Reuters Next” Conference “Rethink, Rebuild, Recover: A New Visionfor a Better Tomorrow”, 12 January 2021.*   *   *A pleasant day to all the participants of “Reuters Next.”As we start the new year, it is apt to share ideas on recovery given the unprecedented COVID-19crisis that mostly defined 2020.The theme of this conference—“Rethink, Rebuild, Recover: A New Vision for a BetterTomorrow”—highlights the pursuit of a stronger world economy, which is a fitting top agenda forall nations.  As an international community, we have to “rethink” the way we deal with key issues—such asinward-looking policies, equity, and climate change, among others—if we are to “rebuild” theglobal economy toward meaningful “recovery.” We must step up international cooperation toachieve recovery soon.As individual nations, we have to apply the lessons from the crisis that are peculiar to ourrespective economies to move forward.In the case of the Philippines, we expect a much brighter 2021. Besides governmentpronouncements that vaccines will be rolled out toward the end of the second quarter, the factthat the entire government, the BSP included, did our homework last year allows us to expectbetter days ahead.We worked hard not just to survive the crisis, but to ensure faster and smoother transition to ourenvisioned “New Economy“, which is stronger, more technologically savvy, and more inclusivethan how we were prior to the pandemic.Appropriate measures were implemented to address the impact of COVID-19 on lives,livelihoods, and the economy.  Vital laws (Bayanihan I and II) to support front-liners and small businesses were passed on time.Other bills critical for economic recovery are expected to be implemented soon. One will slashcorporate income tax and rationalize fiscal incentives (CREATE)—this is now up for bicameraldeliberations by Congress; and another will help banks dispose bad assets (FIST)—this is nowwith the President for signing.As for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), we implemented a long list of response measures.We injected nearly P2 trillion, equivalent to about 10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), inliquidity to the economy.We implemented policies for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as countingloans to this sector as part of banks’ compliance with the reserve requirement.We rolled out time-bound regulatory relief measures to manage the impact of the crisis on banks’balance sheets.And, we implemented liquidity-enhancement measures to keep the financial system stable, boost 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
market confidence, and allow the National Government to promptly fund its response measures.When domestic developments warrant, the BSP will move toward smooth normalization of ourtime-bound measures, consistent with our data-driven approach to monetary policy.Latest baseline forecasts show inflation – which averaged 2.6 percent in 2020 – will remainwithin the 2.0-4.0 percent target range this year and in 2022.This will provide an enabling environment for investments and consumption growth, and spacefor the BSP to further support growth, if necessary.Last year, we cut policy rates by a cumulative 200 basis points. The BSP was in fact among thefirst central banks to respond to the crisis by cutting rates as early as February last year.Last month, the BSP’s Monetary Board maintained the key policy rate at 2.0 percent.Accommodative monetary policy, together with fiscal initiatives, should quicken the economy’srecovery.Looking ahead, we see solid rebound in 2021.We expect:•    The economy to grow anywhere between 6.5 and 7.5 percent; we have started to see somegreen shoots, including growth in remittances and foreign direct investments;•    Inflation to remain within target;•    Exports and imports to grow;•    Net inflow of FDIs to increase; and•    Remittances to rise. I would like to highlight that remittances had demonstrated resilience,declining by a mere 0.9 percent in the first ten months of 2020, hence our optimistic forecast forthis year.•    External accounts to remain healthy—with the gross international reserves staying aboveUSD 100 billion and a current account surplus.In addition, the banking sector—which enjoyed regulatory relief measures from the BSP and withan enabling law to get rid of bad assets (FIST)—will remain strong and stable.The Philippine banking system continues to have capitalization and liquidity levels well above theregulatory requirements, while non-performing loans (NPLs), albeit slightly higher, remainmanageable.The NPL ratio stood at 3.2 percent as of October 2020, way better than the double-digit NPLs wesaw in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.Meantime, we have embarked on a reform momentum toward the “New Economy.” This is ourway of helping ensure the crisis—which has given a sense of urgency for reforms—is put togood use.Our legislative agenda include:(i)    a bill that will expand the list of sectors that banks can lend to, in compliance with themandated lending for agriculture development; 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
(ii)    a bill that will lift secrecy of bank deposits, which will help efforts against tax evasion andmoney laundering;(iii)    a bill meant to enhance accessibility of credit to MSMEs through a comprehensive creditdatabase, and(iv)    a bill that will improve the protection of consumers of financial products and services.  The BSP also has stepped up efforts toward financial digitalization—side by side our efforts toimprove cyber security supervision.Last October, we launched the Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap.This will aid faster economic growth and usher an era of a more financially inclusive Philippines.With financial technology (fintech), credit, as well as savings, investments, and insuranceproducts become accessible to more people. Also, since it hastens payments, fintech increasesthe velocity of capital turnaround, thereby boosting income growth.Also, we have issued frameworks for open banking, for the creation of digital banks, and forenhanced risk management.  With our efforts, the Philippines is recognized for having one of the best regulatory environmentsfor financial inclusion.Prior to the pandemic, the Philippines had made significant strides in the economic and socialfronts.Poverty incidence had fallen from 23.5 percent in 2015 to 16.7 percent in 2018.Unemployment rate had dropped to 5.1 percent in 2019 from 7.5 percent in 2009. And, we wereabout to become an upper-middle income economy.The COVID-19 crisis has caused setbacks for us.To return to our growth trajectory, medical and macroeconomic interventions should go hand inhand to protect public welfare, which is crucial to boost consumer and business confidence.Having enough monetary space and tools, the BSP will continue to coordinate with the othergovernment agencies as it shares in the heavy lifting to quicken economic recovery.With our whole-of-government approach to recovery, we expect the Philippines to move back toour pre-COVID development path soon.The worst is behind us. The recovery phase has begun. Now, the Philippines is starting to writeits post-COVID narrative, which in the near future will speak of a remarkable rebound.As an active member of the international community, we are happy to share the things that we doto thrive, as much as we are willing to learn from and work with the rest of the world.Thank you very much for listening. I wish everyone a productive conference. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
For release on delivery 2:00 p.m. EST  February 10, 2021         Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market    Remarks by  Jerome H. Powell  Chair  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  at  The Economic Club of New York   (via webcast)        February 10, 2021  
 Today I will discuss the state of our labor market, from the recent past to the present and then over the longer term.  A strong labor market that is sustained for an extended period can deliver substantial economic and social benefits, including higher employment and income levels, improved and expanded job opportunities, narrower economic disparities, and healing of the entrenched damage inflicted by past recessions on individuals’ economic and personal well-being.  At present, we are a long way from such a labor market.  Fully realizing the benefits of a strong labor market will take continued support from both near-term policy and longer-run investments so that all those seeking jobs have the skills and opportunities that will enable them to contribute to, and share in, the benefits of prosperity.   The Labor Market of a Year Ago  We need only look to February of last year to see how beneficial a strong labor market can be.  The overall unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, the lowest level in a half-century.  The unemployment rate for African Americans had also reached historical lows (figure 1).  Prime-age labor force participation was the highest in over a decade, and a high proportion of households saw jobs as “plentiful.”1  Overall wage growth was moderate, but wages were rising more rapidly for earners on the lower end of the scale.  These encouraging statistics were reaffirmed and given voice by those we met and conferred with, including the community, labor, and business leaders; retirees; students; and others we met with during the 14 Fed Listens events we conducted in 2019.2                                                    1 Data from the Conference Board’s “Jobs Are Plentiful” series (February 2020).

 - 2 - Many of these gains had emerged only in the later years of the expansion.  The labor force participation rate, for example, had been steadily declining from 2008 to 2015 even as the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis unfolded.  In fact, in 2015, prime-age labor force participation—which I focus on because it is not significantly affected by the aging of the population—reached its lowest level in 30 years even as the unemployment rate declined to a relatively low 5 percent.  Also concerning was that much of the decline in participation up to that point had been concentrated in the population without a college degree (figure 2).  At the time, many forecasters worried that globalization and technological change might have permanently reduced job opportunities for these individuals, and that, as a result, there might be limited scope for participation to recover.   Fortunately, the participation rate after 2015 consistently outperformed expectations, and by the beginning of 2020, the prime-age participation rate had fully reversed its decline from the 2008-to-2015 period.  Moreover, gains in participation were concentrated among people without a college degree.  Given that U.S. labor force participation has lagged relative to other advanced economy nations, this progress was especially welcome (figure 3).3    As I mentioned, we also saw faster wage growth for low earners once the labor market had strengthened sufficiently.  Nearly six years into the recovery, wage growth for the lowest earning quartile had been persistently modest and well below the pace enjoyed by other workers.  At the tipping point of 2015, however, as the labor market                                                  3 For data comparing labor force participation rates across countries, see Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2021), “Labour Force Participation Rate” (indicator), OECD Data, https://doi.org/10.1787/8a801325-en. 
 - 3 - continued to strengthen, the trend reversed, with wage growth for the lowest quartile consistently and significantly exceeding that of other workers (figure 4).   At the end of 2015, the Black unemployment rate was still quite elevated, at 9 percent, despite the relatively low overall unemployment rate.  But that disparity too began to shrink; as the expansion continued beyond 2015, Black unemployment reached a historic low of 5.2 percent, and the gap between Black and white unemployment rates was the narrowest since 1972, when data on unemployment by race started to be collected.  Black unemployment has tended to rise more than overall unemployment in recessions but also to fall more quickly in expansions.4  Over the course of a long expansion, these persistent disparities can decline significantly, but, without policies to address their underlying causes, they may increase again when the economy ultimately turns down.    These late-breaking improvements in the labor market did not result in unwanted upward pressures on inflation, as might have been expected; in fact, inflation did not even rise to 2 percent on a sustained basis.  There was every reason to expect that the labor market could have strengthened even further without causing a worrisome increase in inflation were it not for the onset of the pandemic.                                                  4 For a description of labor market outcomes by race and ethnicity over the business cycle, see Stephanie R. Aaronson, Mary C. Daly, William L. Wascher, and David W. Wilcox (2019), “Okun Revisited:  Who Benefits Most from a Strong Economy?” in James H. Stock and Janice Eberly, eds., Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington:  Brookings Institution Press, Spring), pp. 333–75, https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/okun-revisited-who-benefits-most-from-a-strong-economy; and Tomaz Cajner, Tyler Radler, David Ratner, and Ivan Vidangos (2017), “Racial Gaps in Labor Market Outcomes in the Last Four Decades and over the Business Cycle,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-071 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.071. 
 - 4 - The Labor Market Today  The state of our labor market today could hardly be more different.  Despite the surprising speed of recovery early on, we are still very far from a strong labor market whose benefits are broadly shared.  Employment in January of this year was nearly 10 million below its February 2020 level, a greater shortfall than the worst of the Great Recession’s aftermath (figure 5). After rising to 14.8 percent in April of last year, the published unemployment rate has fallen relatively swiftly, reaching 6.3 percent in January.  But published unemployment rates during COVID have dramatically understated the deterioration in the labor market.  Most importantly, the pandemic has led to the largest 12-month decline in labor force participation since at least 1948.5  Fear of the virus and the disappearance of employment opportunities in the sectors most affected by it, such as restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, have led many to withdraw from the workforce.  At the same time, virtual schooling has forced many parents to leave the work force to provide all-day care for their children.  All told, nearly 5 million people say the pandemic prevented them from looking for work in January.  In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that many unemployed individuals have been misclassified as employed.  Correcting this misclassification and counting those who have left the labor force since last February as unemployed would boost the unemployment rate to close to 10 percent in January (figure 6). Unfortunately, even those grim statistics understate the decline in labor market conditions for the most economically vulnerable Americans.  Aggregate employment has                                                  5 Published monthly data on labor force participation begin in 1948. 
 - 5 - declined 6.5 percent since last February, but the decline in employment for workers in the top quartile of the wage distribution has been only 4 percent, while the decline for the bottom quartile has been a staggering 17 percent (figure 7).  Moreover, employment for these workers has changed little in recent months, while employment for the higher-wage groups has continued to improve.  Similarly, the unemployment rates for Blacks and Hispanics have risen significantly more than for whites since February 2020 (figure 8).  As a result, economic disparities that were already too wide have widened further. In the past few months, improvement in labor market conditions stalled as the rate of infections sharply increased.  In particular, jobs in the leisure and hospitality sector dropped over 1/2 million in December and a further 61,000 in January.  The recovery continues to depend on controlling the spread of the virus, which will require mass vaccinations in addition to continued vigilance in social distancing and mask wearing in the meantime.  Since the onset of the pandemic, we have been concerned about its longer-term effects on the labor market.  Extended periods of unemployment can inflict persistent damage on lives and livelihoods while also eroding the productive capacity of the economy.6  And we know from the previous expansion that it can take many years to reverse the damage.                                                  6 For research on the adverse consequences of permanent job loss, see Steven J.

Sullivan (1993), “Earnings Losses of Displaced Workers,” American Economic Review, vol. 83 (September), pp. 685–709. 
 - 6 - At the start of the pandemic, the increase in unemployment was almost entirely due to temporary job losses.7  Temporarily laid-off workers tend to return to work much more quickly, on average, than those whose ties to their former employers are permanently severed.  But as some sectors of the economy have continued to struggle, permanent job loss has increased (figure 9).  So too has long-term unemployment.  Still, as of January, the level of permanent job loss, as a fraction of the labor force, was considerably smaller than during the Great Recession.  Research shows that the Paycheck Protection Program has played an important role in limiting permanent layoffs and preserving small businesses.8  The renewal of the program this year in the face of another surge in COVID-related job cuts is an encouraging development. Of course, in a healthy market-based economy, perpetual churn will always render some jobs obsolete as they are replaced by new employment opportunities.  Over time, workers and capital move from firm to firm and from sector to sector.  It is likely that the pandemic has both increased the need for such movements and brought forward some movement that would have occurred eventually.9                                                    7 The Bureau of Labor Statistics defines a job loss as temporary if the affected worker has been given a date to return to work or expects to be recalled to their former job within six months.   8 For research on the effect of the Paycheck Protection Program on employment, see David Autor, David Cho, Leland D.

 - 7 - Getting Back to a Strong Labor Market  So how do we get from where we are today back to a strong labor market that benefits all Americans and that starts to heal the damage already done?  And what can we do to sustain those benefits over time?  Experience tells us that getting to and staying at full employment will not be easy.  In the near term, policies that bring the pandemic to an end as soon as possible are paramount.  In addition, workers and households who struggle to find their place in the post-pandemic economy are likely to need continued support.  The same is true for many small businesses that are likely to prosper again once the pandemic is behind us.   Also important is a patiently accommodative monetary policy stance that embraces the lessons of the past—about the labor market in particular and the economy more generally.  I described several of those important lessons, as well as our new policy framework, at the Jackson Hole conference last year.10  I have already mentioned the broad-based benefits that a strong labor market can deliver and noted that many of these benefits only arose toward the end of the previous expansion.  I also noted that these benefits were achieved with low inflation.  Indeed, inflation has been much lower and more stable over the past three decades than in earlier times.  In addition, we have seen that the longer-run potential growth rate of the economy appears to be lower than it once was, in part because of population aging, and that the neutral rate of interest—or the rate consistent with the economy being at full employment with 2 percent inflation—is also much lower than before.  A low neutral rate means that                                                  10 See Jerome H. Powell (2020), “New Economic Challenges and the Fed’s Monetary Policy Review,” speech delivered at “Navigating the Decade Ahead:  Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20200827a.htm. 
 - 8 - our policy rate will be constrained more often by the effective lower bound.  That circumstance can lead to worse economic outcomes—particularly for the most economically vulnerable Americans.   To take these economic developments into account, we made substantial revisions to our monetary policy framework, as described in the FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.11  This revised statement shares many features with its predecessor, including our view that longer-run inflation of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  But it also has some innovations. The revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad and inclusive goal.  This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.  Recognizing the economy’s ability to sustain a robust job market without causing an unwanted increase in inflation, the statement says that our policy decisions will be informed by our “assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level” rather than by “deviations from its maximum level.”12  This means that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market.  Finally, to counter the adverse economic dynamics that could ensue from declines in inflation expectations in an environment where our main policy tool is more frequently constrained, we now explicitly seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.  This means that following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent,                                                  11 The FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, revised in August 2020 and reaffirmed in January, is available on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf. 12 Italics added for emphasis.  See Powell, “New Economic Challenges,” p. 11, in note 10. 
 - 9 - appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time in the service of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal. Our January postmeeting statement on monetary policy implements this new framework.13  In particular, we expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current accommodative target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.  In addition, we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. The Broad Responsibility for Achieving Maximum Employment  Seventy-five years ago, in the wake of WWII, the United States faced the challenge of reemploying millions amid a major restructuring of the economy toward peacetime ends.14  Part of Congress’s response was the Employment Act of 1946, which states that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal government to use all practicable means . . . to promote maximum employment.”15  As later amended in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, this provision formed the basis of the employment side of the                                                  13 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2021), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, January 27, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20210127a.htm. 14 See Joseph T. Glatthaar (2018), The American Military:  A Concise History (New York:  Oxford University Press). 15 For a discussion, see Aaron Steelman (2013), “Employment Act of 1946,” in Federal Reserve History, https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/employment-act-of-1946; the quotation from the act is reprinted in Steelman, paragraph 1. 
 - 10 - Fed’s dual mandate.  My colleagues and I are strongly committed to doing all we can to promote this employment goal.   Given the number of people who have lost their jobs and the likelihood that some will struggle to find work in the post-pandemic economy, achieving and sustaining maximum employment will require more than supportive monetary policy.  It will require a society-wide commitment, with contributions from across government and the private sector.  The potential benefits of investing in our nation’s workforce are immense.  Steady employment provides more than a regular paycheck.  It also bestows a sense of purpose, improves mental health, increases lifespans, and benefits workers and their families.16  I am confident that with our collective efforts across the government and the private sector, our nation will make sustained progress toward our national goal of maximum employment.                                                     16 See, for example, Daniel Sullivan and Till von Wachter (2009), “Job Displacement and Mortality:  An Analysis Using Administrative Data,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 124 (August), pp. 1265–1306;  Philip Oreopoulos, Marianne Page, and Ann Huff Stevens (2008), “The Intergenerational Effects of Worker Displacement,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 26 (July), pp. 455–83; and Bruno S.

Christine Lagarde: European Parliament plenary debate on the ECBAnnual ReportIntroductory statement by Ms Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, at theplenary session of the European Parliament, Brussels, 8 February 2021.*   *   *Honourable President of the European Parliament,Executive Vice-President of the Commission,Honourable Members of the European Parliament,I am pleased to join you today for the plenary debate on your draft resolution on the ECB AnnualReport. The circumstances could hardly be more different from my first appearance here lastyear.The pandemic has confronted us with a serious public health and economic crisis. The start ofvaccination campaigns provides hope. But people across Europe are still facing the dire socialand economic consequences of the virus and the future remains uncertain.In these circumstances, a close dialogue between the EU institutions is essential for charting aclear way forward and reaching a common European response to common challenges. ThisParliament has ensured that the views of European citizens are heard and acted upon as the EUis tackling the crisis.Parliamentary resolutions like the one we are debating today represent an important occasion forus at the ECB to reflect on how we can best deliver on our mandate for the benefit of allEuropeans. This is also the objective of our ongoing strategy review.I have repeatedly emphasised my ambition to listen more attentively to people from across theeuro area. So I am very pleased to announce to you that we will publish the key findings from our“ECB Listens Portal” today.I would like to thank the almost 4,000 citizens who responded to our consultation and sharedtheir concerns about inflation developments, the current economic crisis and the impact ofclimate change.Together with you and Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, I will start bylooking back at the unprecedented economic crisis that Europe experienced last year and howthe ECB responded. I will then look at the prospects for this year, before discussing some of thepolicy challenges we face in ensuring a strong recovery from the pandemic and how to managethe transition to a greener and more digital economy.The year behind us: responding forcefully to an unprecedented crisis2020 will be remembered for the pandemic, which led to an unprecedented economiccontraction. The European institutions and the EU Member States reacted swiftly, creatively andresolutely, and the ECB played a vital role.Our monetary policy response was centred around two key pillars.First, in March 2020 we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) withan initial envelope of €750 billion. But over the course of the year, incoming data pointed to amore pronounced impact of the pandemic on the euro area economy and a more protractedweakness in inflation than previously envisaged. So the ECB’s Governing Council expanded thePEPP envelope twice, first by €600 billion in June, and then by a further €500 billion in December,1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
for a new total of €1,850 billion.The PEPP was tailored to the specific nature of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis and serves adual purpose. First, it can be operated as a powerful market backstop to prevent destabilisingfinancial dynamics and breakdowns in monetary transmission. And second, it can act as aninstrument that supports our monetary policy stance by smoothing out the impact of thepandemic on our price stability objective. These two engines have been activated with varyingintensity over the two phases of the pandemic emergency. The backstop engine was the first tobe ignited, amidst the financial panic in the early stages of the pandemic. It helped preserve thetransmission of our monetary policy to all sectors and countries in the euro area, thereby avertingan even deeper economic contraction. The second engine took over when markets eventuallycalmed and has been instrumental in nudging inflation closer to the path that we were projectingbefore the pandemic hit.Our targeted longer-term refinancing operations – or TLTROs – were the second major pillar ofour crisis management strategy. We have eased and adapted the terms and conditions of ourTLTRO III programme to reinforce its inbuilt incentive for banks to lend to firms and households.This makes the TLTROs a powerful complement to the PEPP, as they concentrate on thedownstream phases of monetary policy transmission – those that work through banks and moredirectly reach small and medium-sized enterprises, which are most reliant on bank financing.The year ahead: dealing with uncertainty and paving the way for a sustainable recoveryLet me now turn to the outlook for our economy.The start of vaccination campaigns across the euro area provides the eagerly awaited light at theend of the tunnel. At the same time, the renewed surge in COVID-19 cases, the mutations in thevirus and the strict containment measures are a significant downside risk to euro area economicactivity.Output remains well below pre-pandemic levels and uncertainty about how the pandemic willevolve remains high. However, when containment measures are lifted and uncertainty recedes,we expect the recovery to be supported by favourable financing conditions, expansionary fiscalpolicies and a recovery in demand.Despite the steep increase in January due to a confluence of factors, inflation remains low. Thiscan be attributed to weak demand and significant slack in labour and product markets. While weexpect headline inflation to increase further over the coming months, underlying price pressuresare likely to remain subdued owing to weak demand, low wage pressures and the appreciation ofthe euro exchange rate.In this environment, an accommodative monetary policy stance remains essential. It ensuresthat financing conditions remain favourable to put the economic recovery on a self-sustainingtrajectory. Our pledge to preserve favourable financing conditions is crucial in the currentenvironment as it reduces uncertainty about the terms at which the economy can accessexternal finance. This bolsters confidence and will encourage consumer spending and businessinvestment. A more solid recovery is a precondition for re-anchoring inflation around its pre-pandemic path.At the same time, and as I have stressed many times in this Parliament, it remains crucial thatmonetary and fiscal policy continue to work hand in hand. Fiscal policy – both at the national andat the European level – remains crucial to bolster the recovery in the euro area and address theimpact of the pandemic. It can channel economic support to where it is most needed. Byprotecting workers and households and providing lifelines to viable firms that have been hit hardby the pandemic, fiscal support is particularly powerful in boosting aggregate demand.23 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
However, we need to remain vigilant – while fiscal support is crucial at this stage, it should betargeted and focused on the measures that are most conducive to economic growth. Against thisbackdrop, the ground-breaking Next Generation EU package should be implemented in such away that the EU and all its Member States emerge from this crisis with stronger economicstructures and a high degree of cohesion. If implemented as planned, Next Generation EU couldeven boost growth as early as this year.Resetting the course of our economies by investing in the futureIt is essential that the Next Generation EU funds are disbursed quickly and used to supportstructural reforms and growth-enhancing investment projects. This would boost potential growthand contribute to reaching the EU’s objectives in the areas of climate change and digitalisation.We also need ambitious EU policies to make sure that bond and equity markets complementbank lending and public resources in financing a sustainable recovery. Progress in the area ofsustainable finance, for instance, is pivotal to accelerate the transition towards a low-carboneconomy. Efforts to deepen the Single Market, notably its digital dimension and in the servicessector, would provide additional support to the recovery.As co-legislator, the European Parliament has a crucial role to play in advancing Europe’s greenand digital agendas. The ECB is ready to play its part on these two fronts, as you request in yourresolution.Central banks are not responsible for climate policy and the most important tools that are neededlie outside of our mandate. But we cannot simply ignore climate change just because we are notin the driving seat. Climate change has macroeconomic and financial implications andconsequences for our primary objective of price stability and our other areas of competence.We will contribute to fighting climate change in line with our mandate. We have already startedthis process and we will continue to do more. We hold green bonds amounting to 3.5% of ourown funds portfolio and we plan to increase this share over the coming years. Since the start ofthis year, bonds with coupon structures linked to certain sustainability performance targets havebeen eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations and for outright purchases formonetary policy purposes. Within the Eurosystem, we have also agreed on common principlesfor sustainable and responsible investment that we will apply when managing our euro-denominated non-monetary policy portfolios. We aim to start making annual climate-relateddisclosures for these types of portfolios within the next two years. And in the context of ourstrategy review, we will discuss whether sustainability considerations could be reflected in ourmonetary policy operations.On the digital front, the increased use of digital technologies is changing all aspects of our lives,including how we pay. This is where our preparatory work on a digital euro comes in. I ampleased that your resolution welcomes our work in this area – public support for this project iscrucial. As representatives of European citizens, you have a fundamental role to play here. Ourpublic consultation drew over 8,000 responses from individuals, firms and industryassociations. We will present you with a comprehensive analysis of these responses in thespring. This analysis will provide important input for the Governing Council when it decideswhether or not to launch a digital euro project.ConclusionIf we want to pave the way for a sustainable recovery, we need to maintain and strengthen thecommon European approach that proved so effective last year. The ECB is committed to doingits part, within its mandate.4567 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
We are equally committed to continuing and building on the close dialogue with this Parliament.You are essential in our efforts to improve our communication with European citizens. This isanother clear finding from the ECB Listens Portal – many respondents asked us to explain ourdecisions more clearly, in simple language and with relatable, concrete examples. Butcommunication is a two-way street, so we will continue our efforts to listen to your requests andremarks more attentively, as summarised in this resolution. As usual, we will provide our detailedfeedback on the resolution together with the ECB Annual Report 2020.I now look forward to the debate today and the final resolution on our Annual Report.See ECB (2021), Summary Report of the ECB Listens Portal, 8 FebruarySee the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area.This is broadly reflected in the baseline assessment of the December 2020 Eurosystem staff macroeconomicprojections, which foresee annual inflation at 0.2% in 2020, 1.0% in 2021, 1.1% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023 (seefootnote 2).Lagarde, C.

Burkhard Balz: Central bank digital currencies – the future ofmoney?Speech by Mr Burkhard Balz, Member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank, atthe American Council on Germany, virtual event, 10 February 2021.*   *   *1 IntroductionDear Steve,Ladies and gentlemen,I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk to you about one of the most exciting topics facingcentral banks today:The future of money. Do we need other forms of money beside the ones we already have? Anddo we need other forms of central bank money? Should banks’ deposits with the central bank betokenised? Should banknotes become digital?There are many questions surrounding “central bank digital currencies” (CBDC). And we stillhave to find the right answers. But one thing is certain:  central banks around the world haveundertaken tremendous efforts to assess the potential and investigate the opportunities ofCBDC.Just recently, the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) published its third survey amongstcentral banks worldwide. The survey shows a shift from mainly analytical work towards technicalexperimentation. More than 60% of central banks are engaged in practical experimental work.It is clear, then, that even more headway has been made in exploring central bank digitalcurrencies over the past year. On the one hand, the BIS predicts that central banks representinga fifth of the world’s population will issue a general purpose CBDC in the next three years. On theother, a widespread roll out of CBDCs seems some way off. And there are good reasons for this.Because CBDC is a game changer – with potential benefits, but also with a number ofchallenges.Central bank digital currencies promise to combine the improved efficiency of their digital formwith the safety provided by a central bank in a single means of payment.However, central bank digital currency would be a third form of central bank money, alongsidecash and bank reserves. Introducing a new form of central bank money such as this could haveprofound impact on the financial system, especially if it is not only available to banks, but instead,like cash today, to the general public. If not properly thought through, such an intervention maylead to unintended consequences.Today, I would like to outline to you the areas that I believe we need to tackle in order to create asafe, efficient and future-proof currency. But let me start with three trends we are currentlyobserving: digitalisation, declining cash usage and the emergence of new forms of money.2 Trends in paymentsTrend 1: DigitalisationOur economy is growing more digital by the day. Business processes are becoming increasinglyautomated and interdependent. Complex value chains arise. The “Internet of Things” enablesmachine-to-machine communication. E-commerce and online services of all kinds are about to1 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
experience an enormous uptake due to the pandemic. The pace of digitalisation has probablynever been faster than today. These developments are increasingly calling for a safe and efficientsettlement asset which can be seamlessly integrated into almost any kind of business process. Trend 2: Declining use of cashParallel to this, we can see that the use of cash is waning, even in Germany. The currentpandemic has boosted not only the use of credit and debit cards, but contactless payments, inparticular. In a recently conducted survey on payment behaviour in Germany during the coronaviruspandemic, we found out that the share of cash transactions has fallen from 74% to 60% over thelast three years. Admittedly, it remains to be seen whether the current behaviour also persists inthe post-coronavirus period. But what we are currently seeing is quite a considerable change fora country which is strongly accustomed to paying in cash.Trend 3: Emerging means of payments other than €Another trend is the emergence of new forms of digital means of payments. These can becentral bank digital currencies issued by foreign central banks as well as privately issued meansof payment such as stablecoins. At the moment, these alternative means of payment are still inthe development or testing phase. However, given the speed at which technology is developing,their widespread adoption might be far less off than we think. Should these forms of moneybecome widely used as a medium of exchange or store of value in the euro area, significantimplications could arise: for the role of the euro or the payment industry, and consequently alsofor financial stability. 3 Central banks need to be preparedThe three trends I have just outlined highlight that, if the payments ecosystem is going to expand,central banks need to be prepared.As highlighted in the report by the BIS and seven central banks, central banks need to be in aposition to make an informed judgment when it comes to the decision on a central bank digitalcurrency.Any dedicated central bank digital currency should be designed carefully. Possible advantagessuch as safety and efficiency improvements in everyday payments, productivity gains bypromoting money which could be used in programmable environments, or the availability of newservices must clearly outweigh the potential risks with regard to monetary policy or financialstability. In any case, it must be properly designed so as to mitigate all of those risks.The Eurosystem is taking a comprehensive approach to addressing these challenges. As part ofa high-level Eurosystem task force, my colleagues and I identified possible scenarios that wouldrequire the issuance of a digital euro and published them last October in the ECB’s “Report on adigital euro” The Governing Council of the ECB has not yet reached a decision on whether tointroduce a digital euro. We must first be sure that there is a need to issue CBDC and, if so, thatwe are able to manage the accompanying risks. In the digital age, time is of essence. But wealso have to take the time to do our homework.Therefore, the Eurosystem has started to engage widely with citizens, academia, the financialsector and public authorities to assess in detail their needs, as well as the benefits andchallenges they expect from the issuance of a digital euro. In mid-January, a public consultationon the digital euro came to an end with record levels of participation from European citizens.Experimental work supports the analysis of possible technical designs and their implications.234 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Further outreach to the market and exchange with other international central banks leading thework on central bank digital currencies will follow. And this brings me to my last point.4 International dimension will be key International cooperation will be key in shaping the future ecosystem for central bank digitalcurrencies.As the BIS and other central banks have rightly emphasised in their report regardless of the finaldesign, there are certain core features and common standards that are valuable in guiding acentral bank when deciding to issue a digital currency for the public.The features I consider most relevant in this context are convertibility, interoperability andinternational standards.Convertibility is essential to ensure trust in a currency. People must be sure they can exchangethe form of the money they hold at par at any point in time.Interoperability is required to ensure a smooth exchange of money between different kinds ofpayment systems. In a digitalised world, this is an absolute prerequisite to ensure an efficientfinancial system.Finally, appropriate international standards are the focal point in ensuring an efficient cross-border payments flow.In my view, these three features are the key determinants of a stable and broadly accepted digitalcurrency that fits into the international financial system.Against this backdrop, safe and efficient payment markets must be brought to the next level, inparticular for cross-border and cross-currency payments. This topic has been on the agenda forseveral years. While we have seen significant progress in improving payments at the domesticor regional level, cross-border payments are, putting it bluntly, still in the medieval age.The G20 roadmap on enhancing cross-border payments is an important step in this direction.The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, together with the Financial StabilityBoard and the BIS, has set up a comprehensive working programme encompassing 19 buildingblocks across five focus areas, including new payment infrastructures and arrangements, whichcovers central bank digital currencies, amongst other things.This work can only serve the long-term goal of achieving a fair and sustainable paymentslandscape, as long as international cooperation thrives.I am optimistic that this fruitful work initiated by the G20, but also in the form of other internationalformats, will continue. CBDC might not be the panacea for all challenges that payments arefacing. But it might be an option, including for cross-border payments.In a nutshell, payments are – and always will – be a backbone of the economy. The digitaleconomy has already changed the payment landscape quite significantly and will continue to doso in future. It is the responsibility of the central bank to create trust in its currency and to ensurethat payments remain competitive, innovative and safe. We also have to ensure that central bankmoney will be offered in a way that is compatible with the digital economy.Let me finish with the words of Abraham Lincoln: “The best way to predict the future is to createit.”BIS Papers No 114, Ready, steady, go? – Results of the third BIS survey on central bank digital currencies51 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

    Paris – Banque de France, 11 February 2021 The role of central banks in the greening of the economy  Speech by François Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Banque de France            Press contact: Mark Deen (mark.deen@banque-france.fr), Déborah Guedj (deborah.guedj@banque-france.fr
Page 1 sur 8  I would like to welcome you to the Banque de France for this 5th edition of the Rencontres on "Climate Change and Sustainable Finance", organised jointly with Option Finance. Central banks’ commitment to the climate cause may seem obvious today, and this despite the urgency of addressing the Covid pandemic.  But it was not the case five years ago, and few issues have seen such a rapid and massive change in mindset and initiative. At the Banque de France and increasingly within the Eurosystem, we are driven by a simple but tenacious ambition: to do our utmost to support and add to the collective action in the fight against global warming. We cannot do everything – nothing will replace an appropriate carbon price and therefore, let me be clear, a carbon tax in one form or another. But we can do a lot. The Banque de France spearheaded the creation of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), which was launched in Paris in December 2017 and is chaired by our Dutch colleague Frank Elderson. This network - which has already achieved a lot regarding the supervision of banks and insurance companies – now counts more than 80 members, including the US Federal Reserve since 15 December 2020.i Since 2019, the Banque de France has also been the first Eurosystem central bank to publish a full report on its responsibleii investment policy; we are committed to completely exiting coal by 2024. Our European Central Bank, for its part, has been, under the leadership of Christine Lagarde, the first central bank to include the fight against climate change in its strategic review.  Today supervision, responsible investment, support to green finance, which Bruno Le Maire has just forcefully stressed... and tomorrow the greening of monetary policy itself: this morning, I would like to explore together with you this new frontier that lies before us. It is perhaps the least obvious one, but one of the most important. The journey will sometimes be a little technical – I agree – but the roadmap will be all the more precise. I will first come back to the meaning of our monetary action in the face of climate change (I). I will then present three concrete levers for acceleration (II).   
Page 2 sur 8  *** I.  Why must the Eurosystem act on climate change? Should monetary policy be "greened"? The subject easily gives rise to heated debate: on the one hand, there are the "conservatives" – not to mention the climate sceptics – who are concerned only about central banks' action against inflation, and denounce the risks of "politicisation" and “mission creep". And on the other hand, there are the activists who are calling for a change of mandate, with a focus on the fight against climate change and the conversion of instruments – including the American movement for a "Green QE". In my opinion, the truth is simpler and stronger. The Eurosystem's consideration for climate change is neither an abuse of its mission, nor a mere militant conviction or a fad; it is an imperative that we must pursue in the very name of our current mandate and to ensure the smooth implementation of monetary policy.  1.1  In the very name of our mandate Without even having to mention our "secondaryiii" objectives, which include environmental protection, climate change is linked to the core of the Eurosystem’s monetary mandate: price stability. Shocks related to climate change are potentially difficult to manage for central banks because of their stagflationary nature, as they may result in both upward pressure on prices and a slowdown in activity. Transitional policies – which bring about taxation changes, such as a carbon tax, or regulatory changes – can affect prices, notably energy prices, generate inflationary pressures and weigh on activity, as is already the case in the automotive sector. In addition to transition risks, climate events are already having increasingly visible effects on activity and food prices. The price of wheat has currently reached a historic high, partly for climate reasons. In Europe itself, the drought in the summer of 2018 had caused the Rhine to drop to a historically low level and slowed growth in Germany by disrupting river transport.   
Page 3 sur 8  In the longer term, climate change will weigh on the potential growth of our economies. Numerous studies show that higher temperatures reduce labour productivity by about 2% for every degree above 25°C.iv According to simulations by the Banque de France, real GDP in Europe is expected to be 2 to 6% lower in 2050, in the event of a disorderly rather than orderly climate transition.  1.2  For the smooth implementation of monetary policy Climate risk is also a source of financial risk. It is therefore essential, as my colleague and friend Jens Weidmann, President of the Bundesbank, says, that "central banks […] practice what they preach"v for the banks they supervise, i.e. better factor climate risk into their own operations. Moreover, preserving financial stability is a prerequisite for ensuring the smooth transmission of monetary policy, as the NGFS also recently recalled.vi  Let's face it: the ECB's balance sheet is "exposed" to climate risk through the securities it purchases and the assets pledged as collateral by banks, to an extent that is insufficiently taken into account. This is primarily due to the lack of comprehensive and standardised information that is needed for all economic agents to factor in climate risk. I will come back to this need for standardisation later. But more fundamentally, the difficulties in pricing climate risk are due to the very characteristics of these risks, and in particular to what we call "green swans", which generate radical uncertainty and whose consequences can be systemic.vii In this respect, market neutrality – which guides the execution of our market operations – should not put a brake on carbon neutrality.viii Market operations are conducted in a neutral manner as long as they comply with the central banks’ risk control rules. And yet, climate risk is precisely a financial risk that is currently insufficiently measured by markets.ix  Another difficulty is often put forward, but it can be overcome: the fact that climate risk is long-term, while many of our risk measures are short- to medium-term. 
Page 4 sur 8  This is a real technical challenge: the "probability of default" is usually one year; our economic forecasts cover a two to three-year horizon. We must therefore work to "lengthen" our measures, but the fact that a "tragedy of the horizonx" exists is not a call for a status quo. On the contrary! Climate change calls for early and resolute action as the benefits of corrective measures will essentially only be felt in the longer term. II. How should the central bank intervene? How can this be concretely achieved? Let me start by stressing a key point: the Eurosystem's highly accommodative monetary policy is already helping to finance the transition thanks to very low interest rates and abundant liquidity. Green investment will have to be very significant, we are aware of this, – with more than EUR 1,000 billion in public and private investment planned as part of the European Green Deal;xi but never has monetary policy been so favourable for achieving this. The greening of the central bank's actions does not therefore require a further easing of monetary policy, but rather a recalibration of its tools. By next September, we will decide within the Governing Council on the conclusions of our "Strategic Review". To contribute to this debate, I would today like to present our ambitions in the form of a simple triptych: forecast, disclose and incorporate climate risk. 2.1 Forecast, and therefore model  First ambition: to deepen our understanding of the effects of climate change not only on prices but also on growth, both over the business cycle and over much longer time horizons. We are not starting from scratch! Much progress has already been made, notably driven by the NGFS. Our models already incorporate, over a three-year horizon, the effects of tax measures to facilitate the transition, such as the carbon tax. However, changes in the behaviour of economic agents are more difficult to take into account, even though - via expectations - their economic consequences could be felt well before their implementation. We will also need to further examine the impact of the energy sector on economic dynamics, particularly on international trade or the valuation 
Page 5 sur 8  of certain financial assets. Beyond the monetary policy horizon, it is important to assess the impact of climate risk on potential growth and its consequences on the central bank's policy space to achieve its primary objective. I am referring in particular to the long-term effects of more frequent and more severe extreme climate events on capital accumulation, the labour market and migration flows.  2.2 Disclose, and, for this, impose our standards  This brings me to our second ambition: imposing transparency on all our counterparties, not only financial but also corporate, for both collateral and asset purchase programmes. This transparency is a prerequisite for better risk assessment. To do so, I believe that the Eurosystem should require issuers to disclose their climate-related exposures using a metric that needs to be harmonised. As far as the rating agencies themselves are concerned, we could decide to only work with those that include climate-related risks sufficiently. This transparency requirement goes hand in hand with a harmonised regulatory framework. I repeat, and I regret to say that neither in Europe, nor even in France, are we today in a position to compare - and therefore to correctly assess - the heterogeneous data published by financial institutions and companies.  From this perspective, the standardisation of data and the draft Non-Financial Reporting Directive - which will be discussed this year - for adoption hopefully next year, under the French Presidency - will be the battle to be fought in 2021. And it would be unacceptable - at a time when progress on climate change is moving in the right direction and Europe has won the first round of climate-related values - for Europe to lose the second round, i.e. that of measuring these values using standards and published data.  2.3 Incorporate climate risk, into order to reduce it in all of our operations and in the economy The third part of our triptych, the very core of our activity, and the most powerful: reducing our climate risk in concrete terms, through our asset purchase and 
Page 6 sur 8  collateral policies. This ambition requires great dexterity; but it is rooted in a conviction: we have in our hands the tools to move forward, concretely, strongly.  I propose to start decarbonising the ECB's balance sheet in a pragmatic, gradual and targeted manner for all corporate assets, whether they are held on the central bank's balance sheet (purchases) or taken as collateral, without including government securities. There are at least two arguments for such a priority: 1/ it is very difficult to differentiate between the climate policies of the euro area countries. 2/ Conversely, non-financial corporations are clearly identified as players whose activities are the most carbon intensive. Thanks to their transparency efforts, we now know how to calculate climate indicators for more than 90% of the value of corporate bonds eligible with the Eurosystem.xii We also know how to do this for the bank loans of the largest debtors, which are also the most important in climate terms. The second step would be to extend the decarbonisation strategy to securities issued by financial institutions. To achieve this, banks will need to be able to assess their indirect emissions, generated by the activities they finance.xiii After determining the scope, the decarbonisation method remains to be defined. I believe that we should seek to achieve an adjustment of the valuation of all these assets according to the climate transition risk. This solution has the considerable advantage of avoiding the threshold effects that would result in simply excluding certain securities. Ultimately, we will be able to and must directly measure the additional financial risk associated with climate risk, and reduce the value of the assets accordingly: this is notably the aim of all the climate stress test methods that we are now actively working on at the Banque de France and the ACPR, such as in the framework of the NGFS.  But pending their actual completion, we could choose a good "proxy" for this financial risk, namely climate alignment; i.e. aligning assets and firms with the 2°C trajectory set by the Paris Agreement. More specifically, the Eurosystem could use indicators that measure the effort that an issuer makes over a given period to reduce its carbon emissions compared with its peers in the same 
Page 7 sur 8  economic sector. Here, we have most of the data. The most advanced 2° alignment methodologies, even if they have yet to be finalised, are advantageous in that they take into account both past efforts and future commitments to reduce "carbon" emissions over a predetermined horizon. This sector-specific and dynamic assessment over time provides a greater incentive and would prevent all issuers in carbon-intensive sectors from being blindly "punished" (contrary to an exclusion-based approach).  For collateral, this asset valuation adjustment could be directly applied. But our ambition must equally apply at least as much to corporate bond purchase programmes. Here, we are obliged to purchase assets at the market price; but I believe it is possible and desirable to recalibrate the purchase limits per company (tilting) on the basis of climate criteria. For instance, the Eurosystem could limit its securities purchases from issuers whose climate performance is not compatible with the Paris agreement. Conversely, securities issued by "aligned" companies could be purchased in larger quantities. This approach, applying to all companies and our Corporate Sector Purchase Programme, would be more comprehensive than a Green QE, whose quantitative impact would be lower because it would be targeted at green bonds only.  *** This action programme is ambitious: in the fight against global warming, the Eurosystem would thus target the direct effects - better conducting its monetary policy and reducing its own risks - as well as the indirect effects - steering the behaviour of companies and financial institutions, through its disclosure policy, as well as its asset purchase and collateral policies. And this programme is demanding: it requires in-depth work on our macroeconomic models as well as on the climate assessment of assets. But we can make this decision quickly - by the end of this year - and then implement it in three to five years. Then the Eurosystem, together with the European Central Bank, under the impetus created by Christine Lagarde, and the Banque de France, will be the pioneers in this global fight. We must do so, in the very name of our mandate.  
Page 8 sur 8  However, the central banks alone will not be able to do enough. Let us transform this fight into an opportunity, that of a combination of fiscal, monetary and structural policies within the framework of a genuine green policy-mix combining carbon prices, public investment, sector-specific rules and monetary action. “The future is not what will happen to us, but what we are going to do. It calls us, or rather it pulls us to it," said Bergson.

The economic situation and the outlookThe ongoing pandemic and the uncertainty over the public health, social and economic situation continue to affect consumption and investment decisions, with significant repercussions for the production system, employment and income. The marketing authorization of the first vaccines, granted at the end of 2020, gives hope that the health emergency can be countered effectively over the course of this year.However, the risks for the coming months still appear very substantial. The main one is that the containment of COVID-19 may prove to be more difficult than expected. Moreover, it is not clear whether the changes that the pandemic has caused in consumer habits, in the organization of society and of production, and in the way people work will persist.The G20’s cooperative response has made it possible to limit the economic impact of the health emergency. Italy, which has taken over the G20 presidency for this year, will have the opportunity to work towards reaffirming a multilateral approach. Global economic activity will be supported by the latest expansionary measures adopted by some advanced countries and by China’s robust recovery, which is also being facilitated by sizeable public investment. These factors, together with the agreement reached by the European Union and the United Kingdom last December, led the International Monetary Fund to revise its growth projections for the world economy for 2021 slightly upwards, to 5.5 per cent, after the contraction of 3.5 per cent recorded in 2020.In Italy, the marked increase in production activity in the third quarter of 2020 demonstrated that the economy retains the capacity to bounce back. However, the second wave of infection, the resulting restrictions put in place to contain its spread, and heightened uncertainty led, as in other EU countries, to a new drop in GDP in the fourth quarter, equal to 2 per cent on the third quarter and to 6.6 per cent compared with the year-earlier period. The experience gained so far has made it possible to limit its impact on the economy, in part thanks to more targeted containment measures and an improvement in the response capacity of the health system.
4After the strong but partial recovery in the number of hours worked in the summer months, employment is now being affected by the sudden worsening of the economic situation. Since the beginning of 2020, the pandemic has had a significant impact on income and inequality. Among those affected were above all self-employed workers and payroll employees with fixed-term contracts, especially young people and women, who account for a higher share of employment in the sectors most exposed to the crisis. The policies implemented to alleviate its economic effects – such as wage supplementation schemes, the lengthening of the duration of unemployment benefits and the income support measures for self-employed workers and households in difficulty – have been effective overall, mitigating the shortcomings of the welfare system, due above all to the excessive fragmentation of the instruments available.The surveys conducted by the Bank of Italy at the end of November suggest that consumption expenditure is being held back by fears of infection, besides the precautionary motive based on economic and financial considerations. The share of households that expect to spend less than their annual income in the next twelve months has increased; a non-negligible share (about 20 per cent) of the households anticipating a decrease in their income also reported that they expect to save. Over the course of the month, about 80 per cent of households spent less on tourism and restaurant services compared with November 2019, and reduced the frequency of purchases in clothing stores; two thirds decreased their spending on personal care services. The contraction for this set of consumption items was greatest in the regions hit hardest by the spread of the epidemic. These indications confirm the importance of a far-reaching and lasting strengthening of the healthcare system and suggest that a fully successful vaccination campaign will be crucial to a stable recovery.The worsening of the health emergency was also reflected in firms’ assessments of investment conditions, which started to deteriorate again, albeit slightly, in late 2020, especially in some segments of the service sector marked by the presence of a high number of small and micro firms with a limited ability to deal with shocks.Our projections point to a recovery in production starting in the spring, although this central scenario hinges crucially upon the progressive attenuation of the epidemic over the course of the coming months. In addition to this, a robust recovery of the economy will require the reactivation of significant plans for investment; in this respect, a key role will be played by the benefits stemming from a rapid and full implementation of the measures still being drawn up as part of the Next Generation EU programme. However, it is likely that consumption will 
45pick up slowly, especially in services, owing to the gradual manner in which the uncertainty that drove the propensity to save will be reabsorbed.In the current circumstances, measures providing economic and financial relief to households and firms remain indispensable. The urgent need to address today’s problems must, however, be accompanied by reflections on how to conduct the inevitable progressive reduction of support measures in the future. The necessity of guaranteeing protection for workers and preventing healthy firms from exiting the market must be reconciled with the need not to hinder the automatic reallocation of resources towards the firms and sectors with the best growth potential. This process is indispensable to foster the efficiency gains that are fundamental to economic growth.As uncertainty about the economic outlook diminishes, the use of support instruments can gradually be made more selective. Access to broad-spectrum instruments that are significantly more generous than ordinary ones can be revised to make them conditional on firms’ ability to retain their workers and, at the same time, the general freeze on terminations can be eased. It will be possible to return progressively to firms’ sharing the costs of these instruments. When calibrating these measures, it will be important to consider the particular conditions of the various sectors of the economy.Measures to support firms’ liquidity will have to be gradually readjusted to prevent a credit squeeze as the economy begins to pick up again. These measures must not, however, compromise the timely emergence of bad quality loans on banks’ balance sheets, nor should they facilitate the prolonged survival of firms that, independently of the pandemic crisis, would not be able to remain on the market. Firms’ capital strengthening must continue, by means of effective and easy-to-use tools.The contribution of fiscal policy has been crucial to containing the economic fall-out from the public health emergency. However, we cannot cultivate the illusion that the public debt can increase indefinitely. In relation to GDP, it has already risen to levels only previously seen in the wake of the First World War. Fiscal policies must have the clear medium-term objective of guiding the debt ratio back to a downward slope.This goal is within our reach: the low interest rates observed in recent years have reduced the average cost of the debt to historical lows and its residual maturity is a protection against temporary external shocks, but the crucial question 
6remains that of economic growth. Once the pandemic is behind us, achieving stable and sufficiently high growth rates, in line with those in the years prior to the global financial crisis, will allow us to reduce the weight of the debt with budget adjustments that are not excessively onerous. To relaunch the economy, the public spending plans for the green and digital transition must be accompanied by reforms to make Italy more business-friendly: private investment, company growth, and greater innovative capability within the industrial system also depend, to a high degree, on a significant improvement in the services provided by general government.Given the unfavourable demographic outlook, productivity growth must be accompanied by a significant increase in activity rates. On the one hand, it will be necessary to accommodate the current trends by extending working lives and, on the other, we must facilitate participation in the labour market for those segments of the population, especially women and young people, that today remain on the margins of productive activity, above all in the South of Italy. In this regard too, we can only reiterate the importance of removing the lags in the levels of education and learning that exist today.The year that has just ended was characterized by very erratic movements in the financial markets: in the early months of 2020, the yield spread between Italian and German ten-year government bonds repeatedly went above 250 basis points. The consistent approach of the economic policies adopted at national and EU levels led to a reduction of tensions and a sustained decline of market interest rates. A decisive part was played by the resolute and swift action of monetary policy – with new purchase programmes whose flexibility allowed incisive and vigorous action in jurisdictions where the financial tensions caused by the spread of the pandemic had been greatest – and the decision to establish the Next Generation EU programme for the joint funding of individual countries’ investment and development plans by means of issuing European debt securities.The yields on Italian ten-year government bonds have gradually fallen to very low levels and the yield spread with the German Bund has, in the last few days, fallen below 100 basis points, reaching its lowest level since the beginning of 2016. The set of measures adopted to support liquidity has also made it possible to preserve favourable conditions for accessing bank credit on the part of households and firms and to reduce the cost of bond and equity funding.Faced with the effects of the public health emergency, which are expected to last longer than predicted last autumn, at its January meeting, the ECB Governing 
67Council reconfirmed that its very accommodative monetary policy stance and its continued presence on the market are still essential in order to support the economy and prices in the euro area, also by bolstering confidence and reducing uncertainty. The Council also confirmed that any tightening of financial conditions that is not consistent with containing the impact of the pandemic on price stability will be countered resolutely.BanksThanks also to the economic support measures adopted by the Government, Italian banks have kept credit supply standards relaxed in response to firms’ rising demand for funds. The growth in lending to non-financial corporations remained robust in the fourth quarter, still driven by the ample recourse to public guarantees. The average cost of new loans remains at very low levels.The financial aid measures, the supervisory authorities’ guidelines on the use of the flexibility built into the rules for classifying loans, and the expansionary monetary policy stance have all contributed to keeping the non-performing loan rate low. The disposal of NPLs continued, equalling almost €30 billion in 2020, surpassing initial projections. This development was supported by legislation that has enabled banks to convert a portion of their deferred tax assets into tax credits when such assets are sold.Because of the ongoing restrictions on economic activity, rendered necessary to contain the risk of infection, the Government has extended the moratoriums introduced in March 2020 until next June. This measure, also taking account of the clarifications recently published by the European Banking Authority, will make it possible to continue to contribute generously to satisfying firms’ liquidity needs. It is nonetheless essential that moratoriums continue to be a tool to help debtors make it through temporary difficulties, and are not used to conceal clear and irreversible crises. Never before have banks been called upon to perform their role with such skill, acting swiftly to improve the outlook for firms facing temporary distress and to set aside adequate provisions for expected losses, in line with the new accounting standards.Since the start of the year, the new European rules with which credit institutions and non-bank financial intermediaries must comply have further refined the definition of default for prudential purposes. As we have explained, the ‘new’ definition of default does not entail any substantial changes in reports to the Central Credit Register. Instead, it affects the way in which financial intermediaries have 
8to classify their customers’ positions to calculate their capital requirements. As the experience of the four Italian banks that chose to switch to the new system as early as 2019 has shown, the new framework seems to have had a limited impact on the stock of non-performing loans. To reduce the impact to a minimum, we have asked intermediaries to launch a suitable informational campaign on the new rules and to engage one-on-one with their customers more frequently. The goal is to prevent any defaults not connected to any actual situations of distress and to handle such situations effectively.The latest data available show that, at the end of September 2020, the NPL ratio had fallen to 2.7 per cent net of loan loss provisions (5.5 per cent gross of provisions). The downward trend is likely to be interrupted owing to the impact of the current crisis, which, however, is making itself felt more slowly and less intensely than in the past, thanks to firms being in a stronger position when the crisis first hit and to the support measures mentioned earlier. The heightened uncertainty about changes in the macroeconomic outlook calls for a great deal of caution in interpreting the estimates put forth by a number of parties on the possible increase in NPLs. Although it is expected to rise, the non-performing loan rate should nonetheless stay well below the peaks reached during the euro-area sovereign debt crisis.In the medium term, the deterioration in banks’ balance sheets will depend on how quickly our economy is able to exit from this current difficult phase. The build-up of bad debt until 2015 was the result of two severe recessions that occurred in rapid succession. Serious deficiencies in the procedures used by intermediaries to manage NPLs have also had an impact, although important steps forward have been taken in the last five years, in part thanks to the development of the secondary market. While some slight progress has been made, considerable improvement is still needed in the legal and judicial system’s ability to handle the caseload of business insolvencies swiftly and efficiently: to do this, the persistently large gap with other European countries must be closed. It is important that we monitor the actual impact of the reforms that, with the new Corporate Crisis and Insolvency Code, will take effect in the second half of this year. The prudential rules and supervisory expectations based on a calendar provisioning approach seek to ensure that NPLs do not accumulate in banks’ balance sheets without adequate write-downs. In many countries, including ours, the high levels of NPLs – despite the prompting, the targeted inspections and the prudential interventions by the supervisory authorities – were among the main causes of banking crises in the last few years. The effect of this approach on banks’ 
89balance sheets may not prove trivial over the short term, but it is manageable overall. In any case, its impact on intermediaries’ income statements is temporary and will basically disappear over the course of the credit recovery cycle.The capital strengthening of Italian banks continued in 2020. The ratio between common equity tier 1 and risk-weighted assets (CET1 ratio) rose by about 1.2 percentage points, to 15.1 per cent. The capitalization of the profits from the 2019 financial year that were not distributed, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Systemic Risk Board, were a significant contributory factor. These recommendations sought to improve intermediaries’ capacity to absorb losses and to guarantee an adequate flow of credit to the economy. Last December, both the ECB and the Bank of Italy reiterated the need for extreme caution in dividend distribution policies on 2020 earnings. These profits were in part fuelled by considerable government support for firms and households, which also helped to soften the impact of the crisis on credit institutions’ balance sheets. The recommendation is temporary in nature; in these very unusual times, it is necessary to maintain a sufficient degree of capitalization of profits.Banks’ profitability has indeed been significantly affected by the pandemic. Despite essentially stable operating profits, in the first nine months of 2020, the annualized return on equity fell to 2.4 per cent, about two thirds lower than in the same period of 2019. Unusual, one-off events that affected the balance sheets of some large intermediaries contributed to the aggregate decline in profits. In particular, in expectation of a deterioration in asset quality in the future, banks have considerably increased the loan loss provisions for performing loans for which the probability of default has risen.Over the next few months, banks will be called on to manage effectively and with determination the effects of the crisis on credit quality, enhancing the instruments at their disposal to stave off an excessive build-up of non-performing loans and, looking forward, the pro-cyclical effects on credit supply. The European Commission’s recent communication points to initiatives that could be useful to strengthen the secondary market for NPLs, but it falls short regarding the possibility of establishing asset management companies with public support, a tool that, as we have long stressed, is extremely useful, especially during economic downturns.Small and medium-sized banks could feel the effects of the pandemic crisis to the extent that they have greater exposure to firms that do business in the most impacted sectors. This problem is layered on top of the ‘structural’ ones tied to 
10there being fewer opportunities to exploit economies of scale and to diversify, and to the restrictions on accessing capital markets. Given these considerations, which we too have recalled repeatedly, the development of a harmonized banking crisis management framework at European level is necessary and urgent, in order to foster the orderly exit of these intermediaries from the market.It remains crucial that banks be headed by individuals whose professionalism and integrity are beyond reproach. The recent measures issued by the Government finally implement the relevant European legislation; they strengthen, in line with international standards, the requirements and eligibility criteria for bank officials; and they constitute an important step forward in defending the stability of the system and the interests of investors, be they small shareholders or bondholders of credit institutions. The action taken by the supervisory authorities to ensure sound and prudent management must of necessity be complemented by the conduct and competence of bank executives: it is they, first and foremost, who must guarantee the proper functioning of internal controls, an adequate monitoring of risks, and a medium and long-term strategic vision apt for facing the challenges posed by the difficult economic phase. The new legislation represents an opportunity, starting with the upcoming shareholders’ meetings convened to make new appointments, to renew and enhance banks’ managerial human capital, not just for the largest banks.The markets and the G20 Finance TrackThe banking sector is helping to sustain the economy in this phase of the public health emergency; it will need to continue providing its support during the recovery as well, with a complementary role to that of public sector and monetary policy interventions. However, the banks’ role will not only be to lend to firms, but also to help them access alternative funding sources, especially for risk capital. Action is needed to increase trust in the possibility of using savings profitably, so that they can be invested in instruments that allow the firms with the best prospects to be funded.The underdevelopment of Italy’s equity market compared with those of the other main economies stems from the small average size of firms and from their historically low propensity to seek a listing. In recent years, however, there has been an increase in firms’ initial public offerings, especially for small and medium-sized companies and those that are more high-tech. The dynamism of firms, the incentives introduced by the legislator and the simplified listing procedures 
1011adopted by the market are all contributory factors. Once the effects of the crisis have faded, both firms that now need to strengthen their financial structure and those that plan to raise capital on the market to begin new activities will be able to take advantage of this trend to grasp in full the opportunities that the economic recovery will offer them.The diversification of firms’ funding sources and the expansion of investment opportunities for savers are favoured by the process for integrating the European Union’s financial markets, which must continue. The more intermediaries and market infrastructures are able to increase the efficiency of their organizations and to adopt strategic guidelines open to innovation, the greater the benefits for Italy’s financial marketplace. The Borsa Italiana group, to which Italy’s market infrastructures belong, is on the eve of an important operation to transfer its entire shareholding from the London Stock Exchange Group to the Euronext Group, a pan-European federated infrastructure. This operation is currently being examined by the Italian and European authorities. Italian market operating and post-trading companies, in part due to their importance in the group’s capital and financial structure, will be able to provide significant strategic input for the new ownership set-up and to seize the opportunities that may come from the wider range of services provided and a greater presence on European financial markets.In 2021, the merger between SIA and Nexi will come to fruition; these two operators play a central role in the national payments industry. At a time when Europe is strongly committed to creating open, secure and sustainable digital finance, a new Italian hub has emerged that can make a significant contribution at European level to the soundness and innovation of payment infrastructures. An open and competitive context is crucial so that efficiency gains for financial operators translate into lower costs for the end-users.As part of the G20 Finance Track, which brings together Finance Ministers and central bank Governors, Italy’s presidency will promote analyses to evaluate, in light of the crisis caused by the pandemic, the adequacy of the financial regulation reforms introduced since 2008 and problems in the field of non-banking intermediation too, in order to identify any corrective measures that might be necessary.Among the other priorities is that of ensuring the timely implementation of the Roadmap on Enhancing Cross-Border Payments, agreed upon last year to make the cross-border payment system more efficient, with a view to alleviating its fragmentation and to providing cheaper and faster services, especially for 
12remittances. The debate will also continue on private and public digital currencies that might appear on the global scene.The digitalization of finance must be suitably governed, as it provides considerable opportunities but also brings new risks, such as that of excluding the most vulnerable. This includes the initiatives designed to ensure protection for customers and for their data. For retail payments, especially for remote card transactions, strong customer authentication solutions have been adopted to give further support to the development of e-commerce. It is important for the new provisions to be correctly and rapidly implemented by online financial operators and retailers. The work of a dedicated G20 platform (Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion) will also focus on the theme of financial inclusion and aims to capture the existing gaps, also by refining the tools for measuring them, and to find the most appropriate solutions to remedy them.There will also be a significant focus on the issue of environmental sustainability. Finance must necessarily be an active part of strategies to counter climate change, acting rapidly, decisively and with farsightedness while at the same time incorporating the risks it brings in its evaluations. Best practices in terms of environmental sustainability, social commitment and corporate management have positive effects on firms’ economic and financial equilibrium, on risk management and, ultimately, on the well-being of all citizens.Investors’ growing interest is leading to a marked expansion in sustainable finance and thus expanding the availability of capital for funding the transition towards a low-carbon economy. This trend has to be supported by better corporate information; firms that lag behind in increasing their transparency will find it difficult to attract capital. Correctly identifying and quantifying the exposure of their assets to climate risks is also essential for managing them more accurately and effectively.* * *The pandemic, with its terrible toll, is not yet behind us, and much uncertainty remains about the course it will take. Considerable efforts are still required to tackle the health emergency and support the hardest hit businesses, workers and households. Our economy has demonstrated its capacity to recover. Italy must now find the cohesion it needs to return to the path of development, exploiting the opportunity provided by the EU’s pandemic response and addressing the structural 
1213problems that hold it back in the formation of a common strategy, one that has at its centre the challenges of environmental sustainability and the digital transition. The components of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, together with a broader recalibration of national policies, must aim to increase growth potential, defining the projects and their management in such a way as to permit their rapid realization, within the tight deadlines set out in the European programme and in accordance with the detailed operational guidelines of the European Commission. This is no small challenge for the public administration. As much as it is vital for modernizing the production sector, if it is not accompanied by reforms that tackle the problems hindering development and private investment, the Plan’s implementation risks being insufficient to guarantee a lasting increase in the pace of growth. It is not just a matter of formally adhering to the recommendations of the European Commission, but rather of dealing concretely with problems that have been debated for years. The combination of the boost to potential GDP growth, made possible by a careful and targeted use of Next Generation EU funds, and the prolonged expansionary effects of monetary policy, offers Italy the opportunity to aggressively tackle its high debt-to-GDP ratio as well.Thanks to its relatively high residual maturity, the cost of the debt will remain low for a prolonged period of time, even after market and official rates have started to rise again. In these circumstances, if, as we have shown we can, the country succeeds in returning to a path of steady growth, the debt-to-GDP ratio could fall rapidly from the high point reached owing to the crisis. Renewed confidence in the quality of policies and in the economic outlook could enable a further narrowing of the yield spread between Italian and German ten-year bonds, which is still close to double that of Spain and Portugal. As the economy improves, an appropriate strategy to gradually rebalance the public accounts could strengthen these confidence effects and further accelerate the reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The present difficulties must not prevent us from looking to the future. Certainly, there are risks in the near term. Yet by cultivating a longer-term vision, it is possible to do better than the trend projections suggest. Mindful, decisive and effective answers are required for today’s very serious problems, greatly exacerbated by the pandemic but also reflecting existing structural gaps. Closing  these gaps will require a collective commitment, on the part of all firms operating in our economy, including those in the financial industry represented here, but also by the institutions on which economic policy action depends. Extraordinary relief measures have been the necessary response for dealing with the most acute phases 
14of the crisis. Once the emergency is over, the measures designed to alleviate the difficulties of those hardest hit must constitute a bridge towards the realization of the reforms and investment that will enable the country to return to the path of growth from which it has strayed for too long.

Annual address by Governor Øystein Olsen to the Supervisory Council of Norges Bank on Thursday,  18 February 2021ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVESTHURSDAY18 FEBRUARY2021
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 20212Economic perspectives 2021INTRODUCTIONOne year ago, I stood here and delivered the annual address to 300 guests. This year is different. This evening there are no guests physically present at the central bank. The contrast with last year could hardly be greater.The same also goes for the theme running through this evening’s speech – the Covid-19 pandemic. Not a trace of it can be found in last year’s speech. Yet contagion was lurking right outside our borders. We sensed that something was brewing. Norges Bank was in the process of revising down its economic forecasts. The employees at our Shanghai office had been sent home, yet we did not foresee how far-reaching the outbreak in Wuhan would be. Two weeks after delivering last year’s speech the first case was recorded in Norway – soon thereafter, Norway went into lockdown.Since then, we have done what people do during serious epidemics – we engage in social distancing. We can still meet – in a way. Technological innovation has provided us with new possibilities.During the Black Death, wealthy farmers from the western fjords of Norway isolated themselves in Jostedal, a remote valley that reaches into the mountains. They had to find new ways to communicate. The farmers maintained contact with the outside world by sending and receiving letters placed under a stone at the entrance to the valley.This past year, the letter stone has been replaced by the internet.Illustration: Theodor Kittelsen, Photo: National Museum / Ivarsøy, Dag Arne
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 20213A HISTORICALLY DEEP DECLINEEleven months after the first lockdown, daily life has yet to return to normal. Norway has been quite successful in keeping down infection rates, although we have seen regular flare-ups. The country’s borders are now closed.The measures to contain infection are necessary, but they do have side effects, both economic and social.People in risk groups have been isolating. Young people have been following courses online – many alone in a bedsit. Socialising with friends has been put on hold192119311940194419892009202000Chart 1 Historically deep decline              GDP for mainland Norway. Annual growth. PercentSources: Statistics Norway and Norges BankFor Norway, the economic downturn will stand as one of the deepest in history (Chart 1). Not since the Second World War has activity in the Norwegian economy shown such a steep decline.The crisis has had uneven effects.Containment measures and fear of infection have resulted in a sharp decline in spending on services. During the lockdown last year, unemployment increased fourfold over a few weeks, reaching 400 000 persons, or close to 15 percent of the labour force. In some business sectors, unemployment remains very high.Other sectors have been shielded. Interest rate cuts have given households more money to spend. At the same time, there were fewer opportunities for them to spend it. So while some have faced a precarious job situation, others have used the occasion to save. We see the same impact and uneven effects in a number of other advanced economies.

The differences reflect in part how quickly countries locked down and put a brake on the first wave of infection. The design of support measures, organisation of the health sector and structure of the economy have also played a decisive role.In countries with a rudimentary welfare system and a large informal sector, the pandemic has had serious consequences. Unfortunately, 2020 proved to be the year when the global poverty rate showed a renewed rise.THE WAY AHEADPandemics are watershed events that leave behind long-lasting scars. They have claimed a multitude of lives through history. The most devastating ones have laid fertile land barren, reduced the supply of labour and entailed a loss of knowledge. During the Spanish flu pandemic, more than 50 million lives were lost, many of working age.Once the Covid-19 pandemic is over, we will have been through a long period of restrictions on how we spend money, how we get from place to place and how we work. The Covid-19 pandemic will leave behind scars as well.

Contribution to average annual growthSources: Statistics Norway and Norges BankProductivityEmploymentGDP per capitaGrowth in output per capita has been moving down over several years (Chart 3), and labour input is now growing at a snail’s pace. At the same time, the primary source of growth – productivity – is making a steadily smaller contribution. This is a trend we share with other advanced economies. An underlying driving force – cross-border trade – is showing signs of flattening out. The pandemic could influence these trends.Previously, sharp declines in economic activity have been followed by a persistent rise in unemployment and a lower labour force participation rate. In Norway, we saw this following the financial crisis and after the fall in oil prices in 2014. Five years after the oil price fall, employment was still lower than before in those parts of the country that were particularly hard hit.1     Lower      secondary school     Upper      secondary schoolHigher education,up to four years Higher education,over four years  0500010000150002000005000100001500020000Chart 4 Rising number with low education levels among long-term unemployedLong-term unemployed.

NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 20216The pandemic may result in a new round of exclusion from the labour market. Many have now been out of work for a long time, and the share of long-term unemployed is higher than in earlier crises. Many of them have low education levels (Chart 4).  Long-term unemployment leads to a loss of skills.The support schemes implemented by the authorities are meant to be a bridge to more normal times. But the new normal will be shaped by adjustments in household and business behaviour over the past year. Once the economic downturn is over, the labour market may have changed. Certain jobs may not be coming back, making the path back to work difficult for some. A number of long-term unemployed may drop out of the labour market entirely.The long-term decline in productivity growth has taken place alongside a digital revolution. A number of explanations for this apparent paradox have been advanced. For instance, it may be costly to introduce new technology that increases work efficiency.2 Another hypothesis is that a shift in the structure of the economy towards a larger services sector has depressed productivity growth.During the pandemic, many businesses have been doing things in new ways, but have put restructuring on hold. Over the past year, there have been fewer bankruptcies than normal, and investment activity in the business sector has been low. The downturn may have reduced the value of production capital and skills. New businesses will be established, and workers will have to acquire new skills. This process takes time and, while underway, may dampen productivity growth further.But the pandemic may also unlock a larger share of the potential inherent in new technologies, perhaps in certain service segments in particular. Over the past year, we have been forced to use a wider array of digital tools, both at work and at home. Online shopping has surged. Large-scale processes have been managed from kitchen tables, children’s bedrooms and home basement offices. International conferences are livestreamed.We will continue to use many of these solutions. The pandemic will also leave behind a positive legacy.Last winter we saw how short the path was from a local virus outbreak in Wuhan to a global health crisis. Covid-19 followed the same routes as tourists, labour and goods. The virus showed how closely interconnected and interdependent countries are.2 See The Productivity J-Curve: How Intangibles Complement General Purpose Technologies Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock, and Chad Syverson NBER Working Paper No. 25148, https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25148/revisions/w25148.rev0.pdf

Percent              Sources: Refinitiv Datastream, WTO and Norges BankTrade in goodsTrade in servicesA rising number of countries have been integrated into world trade over the past decades (Chart 5). The gains have been substantial. Poverty has been reduced. Cross-border cooperation has enabled technology to advance faster than it would have done otherwise.Since the financial crisis, growth in global trade has stalled. While service exports have continued to rise, trade in goods as a share of global GDP has been more or less flat in recent years because a number of sources of growth in goods trade are drying up. Large countries such as China and India are now fully integrated into the global economy. Robotisation has put the brakes on offshoring production from high-cost countries.So far there are few signs that the pandemic will lead to more permanent changes in global trade. Despite some disruptions in global supply chains and goods transport, trade in goods has held up well. Following a temporary decline, trade picked up through 2020.Travel and tourism are among the industries profoundly affected by the pandemic. Much of the tourist traffic is likely to rebound once we can cross borders freely again, but many have discovered this past year that online meetings are also an effective alternative. This may result in less travel activity than before. Environmental considerations suggest the same.During the pandemic, national governments have had to focus primarily on giving their own population the best possible protection against serious health consequences. At the same time, this past year has clearly demonstrated the importance of cross-cultural and cross-border cooperation. Thanks to an extensive international research effort, effective vaccines could be quickly rolled out.Let’s hope that it is this experience that we carry forward. In the long run, all countries benefit from open borders, common standards and international cooperation.
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 20218A MORE ACTIVE FISCAL POLICY ABROADDuring the pandemic, economic support measures have been massive. While both monetary policy and fiscal policy action was quickly taken, fiscal policy took the lead (Chart 6). This was the case everywhere the pandemic has raged, not only in Norway.USUKBrazilJapanChinaIndiaItalyFranceGermanyNorway0510152005101520Chart 6 Forceful fiscal policy response                     Increased spending and reduced taxes.

Fiscal policy measures have targeted the industries hardest hit by containment measures. The objective has been the same: Persons who were out of a job had to be secured financially. Unnecessary job losses had to be avoided.Monetary policy has underpinned fiscal policy measures. Policy rates were reduced where possible. Moreover, unconventional monetary policy, such as asset purchases, was stretched even further.Central banks have also effectively performed the tasks assigned to them for ensuring well-functioning capital markets. Extensive central bank measures prevented problems in the financial system from amplifying the global downturn.

Percent1) Weighted average of money market interest rates for seven trading partners.Source: Refinitiv Datastream                                                  A prevailing view over the past decades has been that fiscal policy should follow simple, robust rules and should to a limited extent be used actively to stabilise the economy.Globally, there are now signs that this view is changing. The pandemic may mark a turning point. In the period ahead, we are likely to see a more active fiscal policy among many of Norway’s trading partners. There are several reasons for this.For one thing, there is a recognition that the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is limited. After the financial crisis, a number of central banks have assumed considerable responsibility for sustaining activity and smoothing economic fluctuations. At the beginning of last year, policy rates were therefore already at very low levels (Chart 7).At the same time, low policy rates reflect long-term trends, such as an ageing population, a high willingness to save, greater inequality and declining productivity growth. The result is that the level of what we refer to as the neutral interest rate is lower than before, even when economic conditions are in balance. The room for policy rate reductions in downturns is therefore smaller.The change in the view of fiscal policy’s role also reflects the growing focus on structural challenges: economic inequality, a shift towards a greener economy and the need for investment in digital infrastructure. In the new US administration, we find this policy expressed by the motto “Build back better”. In the euro area, the policy has been labelled the “European Green Deal”.

An amount borrowed today becomes a debt that must be repaid tomorrow. Experience from the past 40 years shows that while public debt grows during crises, it does not shrink when economic conditions normalise (Chart 8). During the financial crisis, governments in many advanced economies borrowed on a large scale. Much of this debt was still outstanding at the beginning of 2020. During the pandemic, borrowing needs have again been substantial. Public debt has ballooned to new heights.Persistently low interest rates mean that government borrowing appears to be on favourable terms. But at some point further ahead, interest rates will rise again. Central banks will have to consolidate their balance sheets. Some countries will then find themselves in vulnerable position.NORWAY WAS WELL POSITIONEDNorway clearly stands out in this regard. We were well positioned to face the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic. Unlike many other countries, we have been able to pursue a very active fiscal policy without having to borrow. We also had room for manoeuvre in monetary policy.In a little over a month, it will be 20 years since the current framework for the division of responsibility in economic policy was established. Fiscal policy would be guided by the fiscal rule, while monetary policy would target inflation. Up until 2001, fiscal policy was responsible for stabilising employment and output. After the switch to inflation targeting, monetary policy has functioned as the first line of defence in stabilisation policy.The primary task of monetary policy is to ensure monetary stability. It must not pursue its primary objective to the exclusion of other relevant considerations. Monetary policy must also take into account the real economy. A monetary policy regime that ends up amplifying fluctuations in the real economy will fail the test of time. As long as confidence in low and stable inflation is well anchored, monetary policy can contribute to high and stable output and employment.
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 202111This monetary policy regime has performed well through several rounds of shocks to the Norwegian economy. Both during the financial crisis in 2008 and after the oil price fall in 2014, monetary policy was able to respond quickly. Moreover, the krone exchange rate has functioned as an important shock absorber. When Norway’s terms of trade weakened owing to the oil price fall, a weaker krone helped to support business sector competitiveness.1991199620012006201120162021024681012024681012Chart 9 Historically low policy ratePercent                             Source: Norges BankWith a policy rate of 1.5 percent, monetary policy could again make a contribution when Norway and much of the global economy locked down nearly a year ago. In the space of a short time, the policy rate was lowered to zero (Chart 9).The policy rate cuts had a broad impact and freed up funds for indebted businesses and households. As containment measures are scaled back, continued low interest rates will underpin consumption and investment, paving the way for a resumption of business activity.The room for manoeuvre in monetary policy is nearly exhausted. We do not envisage making further policy rate cuts from today’s level.Yet as long as the crisis is ongoing, an expansionary monetary policy will be needed to stimulate the economy. This reduces the risk that unemployment becomes entrenched at a high level. At the same time, persistently low interest rates entail a risk of a build-up of financial imbalances. In Norway, rapidly rising house prices and further household debt accumulation pose a particular risk. Once there are clear signs that economic conditions are normalising, we will again seek to normalise the use of instruments – as we did after the financial crisis in 2008 and after the oil price fall in 2014.
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 202112SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT PENSION FUND GLOBALThe monetary policy stance in the period ahead will be influenced by the timing and means of fiscal policy normalisation. Here the authorities face a difficult balancing act.On the one hand, the crisis is not yet over, and there is uncertainty regarding infection rates and the progress of vaccination. Against this background, the Storting (Norwegian parliament) has decided to extend the extraordinary support measures aimed at both individuals and businesses until September.At the same time, it is important that the support measures are scaled back as the situation becomes more normal. If these measures are extended too far into the future, we risk impeding necessary business restructuring. Workers may miss out on opportunities to seek new jobs, and unemployment may become entrenched at a higher level than prior to the crisis.In the light of long-term considerations, it is also important to reverse the sharp rise in government spending during the crisis.In 2020, NOK 300 billion was transferred from the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) to cover the central government budget deficit. The decision to tap the GPFG has been the right one. An economic shock of the scale that we have witnessed requires potent medicine. The GPFG is intended to act as a buffer when the economy is exposed to shocks. At the same time, it is an intergenerational investment fund to be distributed across current and future generations.The pandemic is the third large economic shock to hit the Norwegian economy in the space of a few years. Each time, transfers from the GPFG to the central government budget have increased, but without being substantially reduced afterward.20012006201120160510152025300510152025302020Chart 10 Before the crisis: One krone in six transferred from the GPFGTransfers from the GPFG as a share of public spending.

NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 202113In 2020, one krone in four of all central government budget spending came from the GPFG. But even in more normal years, transfers have been considerable. In 2019, nearly 18 percent of spending – one krone in six – was transferred from the GPFG (Chart 10). Because of the fund’s substantial size, this has been possible without breaching the fiscal rule.In the course of a decade, public budgets have come to rely heavily on the return on the GPFG, which was originally established to shield the Norwegian economy from oil price volatility. Today, a large portion of the resources under the shelf has been tapped and converted into investments in global equities and bonds. The GPFG has grown to become immense. This has provided fiscal space, but it has also increased our exposure to fluctuations in global securities markets. One vulnerability has been replaced with another.Q1Q2Q3Q4050010001500050010001500Chart 11 Considerable movements through 2020GPFG.

The decline was more brutal and the rebound faster than we have previously seen. Over 22 days, the global composite equity index fell by 20 percent, but the markets quickly reversed direction. Already in the second quarter, the GPFG’s worst quarterly result turned around to one of its best (Chart 11).The GPFG has enjoyed several years of solid returns – above the returns expected. This does not mean that we should revise up expected future returns – perhaps the opposite.

Percent  Source: BloombergThe expected annual real return is estimated at 3 percent. The estimate was most recently updated in connection with the decision to increase the allocation to equities. Two key variables were used in the calculation. One was the expected return on the fixed income portfolio, and the other the size of the equity risk premium, which is the extra compensation we expect when taking risk in the equity market.The bulk of the fixed income portfolio is invested in long-dated sovereign bonds. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise. The return on the fixed income portfolio therefore held steady through the period of falling interest rates. But this is a one-off gain (Chart 12). Interest rates have now fallen to historic lows, and the expected return on the fixed income portfolio going forward has fallen.Equity prices have risen sharply in recent years. Taking risk in the equity market has paid handsomely. But we cannot assume that the gains will be as high in the future.If we were to repeat our calculations from 2016, the changes in interest rates alone would have reduced the estimated expected real return from around 3 percent to about 2 percent annually.3Such estimates are fundamentally uncertain. The actual return may be substantially lower or higher than this estimate, as the history of the GPFG has shown. Even so, this uncertainty is something that we should bear in mind when drafting future central government budgets.3 Other assumptions underlying the calculation of the GPFG’s expected real return, including an estimated equity risk premium of 3 percentage points, are held constant.
NORGES BANKECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES18 FEBRUARY 202115CONCLUSIONEleven months ago, Norway had to lock down. At that time, we had no vaccine or medicines that could prevent the illness from spreading. We had to resort to well-known remedies: Hand disinfectant, soap, hot water and not least – social distancing. Here at Norges Bank, it has not been any different.But times have changed. During the Spanish flu pandemic, Norges Bank decided to dispense a daily dose of cognac to employees who were ill or not feeling very well. And as Chief Cashier Cederstrøm could report: “…Its effect was instantaneous – no one got sicker, and everyone got better – the Spanish flu was no longer raging at Norges Bank.”Nowadays, most of us would have politely declined the offer of cognac during working hours. The vaccine is a safer bet. There are brighter and better days ahead. The pandemic will soon be on its way out.For those who have become unemployed or furloughed or had their lives put on hold, this is heartening news. This also gives hope to business owners who have struggled to keep going. Yet for many, operating conditions have changed. The pandemic is leaving its mark. Businesses have closed, study plans have changed and demand in the labour market has likely shifted towards new skills.In the meantime, we must hold firm to the characteristics of our society that have proved to be strengths in the face of crisis.Throughout the pandemic, the health sector has been able to provide care for all severely affected Covid-19 patients.We have leaned on a well-developed welfare system. Covid-19 patients and symptomatic persons have been able to stay at home. The unemployed have not been left without income.In economic policy, there has been room for forceful action.But perhaps most important of all, the crisis has shown the importance of trust and solid institutions. We have placed our trust in the measures taken by our government and in each other. This is what we do when our country is faced with a crisis. Come what may.Illusration: Theodor Kittelsen
1.maintaining our supervisory focus on  nancial and operational resilience of  rms and markets to ensure theycontinue to support households and business through the economic disruption caused by COVID-19; and cansupport the recovery from it;“Governance and risk in a time of uncertainty and change” - DeputyGovernor Ed Sibley17 February 2021 SpeechSpeech to Institute of Directors Good morning.I would like to thank the Institute of Directors for inviting me to speak with you today1. We are living through a time of great uncertainty – uncertainty over the short term path of the COVID-19 pandemic and its longer term effects; uncertainty regarding the pace and extent of technology and related behavioural changes; uncertainty about the timing of the effects of climate change; and much more besides.This uncertainty has implications for how we think about risk and probabilities, and importantly how we govern, lead and manage our organisations.  I will explore these issues in my remarks today. I will outline how the approach to the fundamentals of governance and risk management need to continue to improve.I will start by summarising some of the Central Bank’s key regulatory and supervisory priorities for 2021.Financial Regulation Priorities in 2021The mission of the Central Bank is to serve the public good by safeguarding monetary and  nancial stability and by working to ensure that the  nancial system operates in the best interests of consumers and the wider economy. The Governor of the Central Bank recently outlined the Bank’s 2021 priorities2. Today, I will expand on some of the sub-set of speci c  nancial regulation priorities for 2021, which are focused on the near and longer term challenges we see in the system.Our priorities are informed by our overarching aim for the  nancial system to be resilient and trustworthy, for it to sustainably serve the needs of the economy and its customers and for  rms and individuals within the system to adhere to a culture of fairness and high standards. In 2021, our  nancial regulation strategic priorities include:
2.seeking to improve governance and risk management capabilities in  rms and markets to improve culture anddecision-making and ensure that risks are identi ed and effectively mitigated, including the risks from disruptivechange such as climate change;3.seeking to ensure that detrimental consumer outcomes are identi ed, prevented or mitigated, including thosearising from the pandemic, such as business interruption insurance, where extensive supervisory engagementcontinues to ensure  rms pay valid claims; and differential pricing, where we have set out a number of immediaterequirements to insurers as we work towards publication of our full  ndings, together with a potential consultationon proposals to further protect consumers, planned for July 2021; and4.resolving both pandemic related and longer term distressed debt in the system, ensuring the fair treatment ofborrowers in  nancial distress and preserving  nancial stability.In delivering the above, we remain focused on seeking to ensure that regulated  rms: (i) have sustainable businessmodels; (ii) suf cient  nancial resources including through times of plausible and severe stresses; (iii) are well governed,with appropriate cultures and effective risk management; and (iv) can recover if they get into dif culty and areresolvable without recourse to the taxpayer if they cannot. Given the audience today, I want to focus in on governance and risk management.  Before covering these areas in detail, Ithink it is worthwhile to re ect on the pandemic.COVID-19We are still experiencing a profound shock from the COVID-19 pandemic. It is,  rst and foremost, a cause of humantragedy.  It has challenged our resilience in many ways and has had a devastating effect on many families and individuals.The health emergency has also had a profoundly negative effect on many businesses and household incomes, due to theassociated economic disruption. While the timing and nature of the current shock were largely unforeseen, the Central Bank has long recognised theinevitability of economic shocks and downturns. We have focused over the last decade on rebuilding and increasing the nancial and operational resilience of the Irish  nancial system. Consumer and investor protection frameworks havealso been signi cantly enhanced with this in mind.Much of the Central Bank’s focus over the last year has been on mitigating the effects of the pandemic. The CentralBank’s intertwined responsibilities – consumer protection; monetary policy; prudential regulation; payments, and so on–have strong interconnections with each other. This positions us well to understand and mitigate the effects of thepandemic.The economic challenges posed by COVID-19 have been met by exceptional policy support. This has included a range of scal, monetary, macro-prudential and micro-prudential policy actions (as well as actions taken by  nancial services rms) to support households, businesses and vulnerable borrowers.Vaccine technology has advanced in recent years to such an extent that highly effective vaccines have been developed ina short time period and offer hope that the virus can be defeated. Moreover, technology has enabled many parts of theeconomy (including  nancial services) to continue operating with many workers (typically those with higher and moresecure incomes) continuing to work remotely.  The corollary of this is that the pandemic has disproportionally affectedthose that are least able to afford it.345
As we continue to work through the challenges and uncertainty we all face, there is a need for us all to think afresh ofhow we govern and manage risk and how we work to meet not only the current challenges but also to recognise and faceinto emerging ones too.  It is worth asking ourselves, is it possible that the COVID-19 pandemic is not just a seismic andtragic event, but a stark warning too?  It is worth us re ecting on how we think about future events that have a nearcertainty of occurrence over time, but with some doubt about precise timing and impact.  In other words, how well do weprepare for predictable surprises?Humans tend to be optimistic in nature. It is in some ways a necessary human condition.  Business leaders need to haveoptimism about the future to drive their businesses forward.  However, we should also recognise that there is power innegative thinking – testing our assumptions, considering what could go wrong and considering what we will do if thingsdo go wrong.  Many mistakes, big and small, would be prevented or the impact of them lessened if leaders betterconsidered what could go wrong and what assumptions they were relying on.  “We should all spend more time thinkingabout the prospect of failure and what we might do about it. It is a useful mental habit but it is neither easy norenjoyable.”Global pandemics have been on risk registers for a long time – in my own experience, at least a couple of decades. Therehave also been recent health emergencies in various parts of the World that signalled clear alarm bells for those whowere listening. High pro le organisations and experts have been clear that a global pandemic was a certainty, but thetiming, nature, type and gravity of one was open to doubt.  Notwithstanding its inevitability over time, we were all ill-prepared for its occurrence in 2020.There are lessons here for us to consider for other critically important issues, such as climate change and technologicaldisruption. Climate change effects and costs are with us today.  There is broad scienti c consensus that these effects and costs aregoing to grow exponentially and that the future costs of deferred and inadequate action today also continue to grow. And yet, at global, national, political, economic, business and individual levels our responses and planned actions arewoefully inadequate.The pandemic has accelerated and deepened our reliance on technology. Technological change is disrupting thelandscape of  nancial services. The competitive landscape is changing, with new entrants, new business models, a raceby incumbents to invest in developing the necessary capabilities, and in many cases the potential for a fundamentaldisruption in the value chain of traditional  nancial services  rms and sectors. All business models are vulnerable tothis pace of technology change and there are few, if any, that will be able to survive without change for more than a fewyears.  The cost of inaction, insuf cient action or misdirected action today, will probably be terminal for businesses largeand small over a short time horizon.  And yet, as I will come to, we still see that signi cant improvements are required atboard and executive levels in the understanding of technology and technology related risk.These are complex issues, which will not be solved by simple solutions. But, I am certain that improvements ingovernance and risk management are pre-requisites to successfully rising to meet these challenges, so I will now turn toour work and expectations in these areas.Governance and risk management6789
As I have already outlined, there is a strong case for fundamentally reconsidering how we think about risks.   There isalso a need to signi cantly improve how  rms are being governed today.  Some of the recurring issues pre-pandemic thathave undermined effective internal governance and risk management in  rms include: So, what is the Central Bank doing and what do we expect?Accountability and decision makingIndividual accountability has been a focus for the Central Bank since the global  nancial crisis. It has been a decade sincethe Fitness and Probity (F&P) Regime was introduced to ensure that individuals who hold certain positions in regulated rms are committed to high standards of competence, integrity and honesty.  More recently, we have proposed theintroduction of an enhanced Individual Accountability Framework (IAF) for individuals, particularly senior individuals,working in regulated  nancial services  rms in Ireland.The four key components of this proposed framework are:1. Conduct Standards which will set out the behaviour the Central Bank expects of regulated  nancial servicesproviders (RFSPs) and the individuals working within them;2. A Senior Executive Accountability Regime (SEAR) which will ensure clearer accountability by placing obligationson  rms and senior individuals within them to set out clearly where responsibility and decision-making lies for theirbusiness;3. Enhancements to the current F&P Regime to strengthen the onus on  rms to proactively assess individuals incontrolled functions on an ongoing basis, and to surmount some current limitations of the F&P Regime; and4. A uni ed enforcement process, which would apply to all contraventions by  rms or individuals of  nancial serviceslegislation.In evolving the individual accountability framework, we are of course keen to ensure that we do not unbalance theframework of collective decision-making and individual accountability by an increased focus on the individual aspects. Infact, we expect that enhancing individual accountability should result in better collective decisions due to a heightenedawareness on the part of individuals of their own increased accountability for the discharge of their function, includingwith respect to their participation in collective decision-making. We expect that the new framework will re ect this inthe obligations of individuals.weaknesses in connecting strategy with risks and  nancial resources;de ciencies in board oversight of director and senior management appointments;10a lack of effective challenge of the executive by the non-executive directors;weaknesses in the governance of  rm’s risk appetite, including a lack of appropriate reporting to the board;inadequate resourcing of the risk management and compliance functions and poor quality governance of complianceactivities and assurance work; and11weaknesses in understanding and approach to IT related risk management.12
We are working closely with the Department of Finance to develop this framework, so that the necessary legislativeproposals can be brought forward as soon as possible, after which we will be in a position to consult publically on theproposals and will look forward to engaging further with you then.Diversity & InclusionWhile some  rms are starting to make progress, much more needs to be done to increase the diversity of experience,thought, background and attributes at senior levels, to reduce the likelihood of groupthink, reduce overcon dence,improve decision-making, increase the level of internal challenge, improve risk management, and reduce excessiveresistance to external challenge.This is becoming even more important as we strive to deal more effectively with the complex challenges we face todayand respond to the evident unequal effects of the pandemic. It is in times of change and uncertainty when qualities suchas resilience and innovative thinking are essential, and the value of diversity of background, thought and experience areall the more important.The Central Bank will continue to require improvements in this area ; undertake detailed and thematic reviews ; andpublish research and information on the issues and progress (or lack thereof) in improving diversity and inclusion inregulated  rms.  Technology and innovationAdvances in technology are bringing rapid and deep changes to the  nancial services sector. These are impactingbusiness models, decision-making, systems and processes, and products. They are having a material effect on theoperation of  nancial markets,  nancial supervision and the economy.Financial services  rms are looking to innovation, such as increased automation; digitisation of processes; the use ofalgorithms; and machine learning to deliver cost reductions and ef ciencies, and competitive advantage resulting fromimproved customer offerings. Big Data Analytics can allow for advanced risk assessment and pricing.New payment methods and platforms bring challenges for the traditional role and dominance of banks in this area, whiledigital payment channels have lowered the barrier to entry for alternative providers.Innovation has the capacity to bring many bene ts for consumers, the economy and society in general. It is essential tothe effective functioning of a competitive economy.Customers require  rms’ systems and data to be available, reliable and secure. This is also important for  nancialstability reasons. Digital transformation can, without proper oversight, increase vulnerabilities in  rms’ IT operations,with increased risks around IT failures, outages and cyber-attacks.  Firms must strive to minimise the frequency andimpact of issues and have an ability to recover quickly from them.  Resilient systems are a fundamental pre-requisite forsuccessful innovation.The importance of operational resilience has been further reinforced by the experience of the immediate shock fromCOVID-19 and the ongoing shift in consumer behaviour and reliance on remote working. Given the importance ofoperational continuity for the stability of the system and for consumers, businesses and the wider economy, we will13141516
continue to challenge how  rms are ensuring that risk and control frameworks are operating effectively under thecurrent working environment and are prepared for unforeseen operational disruptions.It is important to emphasise that ultimate responsibility for a  rm’s IT risk, strategy and governance rests with theBoard, including the adequacy of digital and IT strategies to deliver and support business strategies and plans.  Boardsmust  rstly ensure they themselves have the skills and knowledge to meaningfully understand the risks theirorganisation faces and the responsibilities they bear. In order for the IT function to be able to operate within set risktolerances, Boards are expected to allocate and periodically review appropriate IT budgets to safeguard the operationalresilience of the IT framework. In this regard, the Central Bank expects Boards to approve, oversee and review theimplementation of Business Continuity Policies and Disaster Recovery Plans. Furthermore, Boards are expected toobtain independent assurance on IT governance by approving and periodically reviewing the IT audit plans and by beinginformed in a timely manner of IT related incidents and their impact on their  rm’s operations.Proposed upstream legislation, such as the EU digital operational resilience act (in short DORA)or the revised EUdirective on security of network and information systems (NIS2), will also seek to further strengthen the governanceand oversight frameworks of IT risk.Climate changeFinally, I want to turn to climate change and sustainability.  Until recently, these would not necessarily have been seen asareas of legitimate interest of central banks and regulators. It is now clear that the macro-prudential policy, economicadvice,  nancial stability, and consumer and investor protection implications of climate change put it  rmly in thebailiwick of Central Banks and regulators.As the President of the ECB, Christine Lagarde, has recently said, “Inaction has negative consequences, and theimplications of not tackling climate change are already visible. Globally, the past six years are the warmest six on record,and 2020 was the warmest in Europe. The number of disasters caused by natural hazards is also rising, resulting in $210billion of damages in 2020. An analysis of over 300 peer-reviewed studies of disasters found that almost 70% of theevents analysed were made more likely, or more severe, by human-caused climate change.”  In this context, the ECB isassessing how climate risks and environmental sustainability considerations are relevant in the pursuit of its mandate aspart of its ongoing Strategy Review, to which the Central Bank is an active participant.So, the question becomes not whether we should focus efforts on climate change, but how and what should we focus on. I believe we have a role in both mitigating the risks from the effects of climate change and taking actions that reducethese effects.Boards and executives need to meaningfully act now to understand and address the challenges associated with climatechange. In order to mitigate the risk and adequately position themselves to respond to these challenges, opportunitiesand regulatory expectations,  rms will need to understand the impact of climate related risks on their businessenvironment, their business models and investments.  This requires lessons to be learnt from the pandemic, changinghow we think about risks and probabilities over the longer term.The Central Bank is a signi cant participant in  nancial markets itself, through its investment portfolio forexample. Investment choices are increasingly informed by climate and sustainability related considerations.1718 192021
As members of the Network for Greening the Financial System and the wider European regulatory system you canexpect the Central Bank to become increasingly active and intrusive in its approach to the supervision of climate changerisks.  Action is required by us all now.  You can expect us to be seeking evidence that:I will conclude here. Unprecedented is an overused word.  It is perhaps fair to say we are living through times that are unprecedented inliving memory.  But it is important that we do not believe that there is nothing that we can learn from history – fromprecedents – whether recent or long past.Moreover, we can also learn from our experience in the pandemic, about how our core assumptions can prove to beunreliable, and about how we think about future events that may seem improbable in a given year but have a nearcertainty of occurrence over time.  Applying these lessons well will be important in how we emerge from the pandemicand how we meet the uncertain challenges ahead, whether these challenges arise from climate change, technology orsome other source.Finally, the pandemic also reminds us of the importance of the basics, the fundamentals of good hygiene, of compliance,of minding those around us, of basic risk management.  Improvements in the fundamentals of better governance; betterrisk management; improving your understanding and testing your assumptions; and actively considering what could gowrong and preparing for it are critical to the  nancial system being resilient and trustworthy; and sustainably servingthe needs of the economy and its customers.I thank you for your attention and look forward to our discussion.[1]With thanks to Lisa O’Mahony, Joern Dobberstein, Pamela Farrell and Tony Cahalan for their assistance in preparingthese remarks[2]Seehttps://www.centralbank.ie/news/article/speech-the-year-ahead-governor-makhlouf-25-jan-21[3]See: https://www.centralbank.ie/news/article/press-release-interim-report-of-differential-pricing-review-14-december-2020. Given that differential pricing can be associated with both bene ts and costs for consumers,completion of this detailed analysis is essential in order to ensure a full market perspective, evidence-based conclusions,and appropriately calibrated regulatory interventions.2223Boards are meaningfully considering climate change risk;climate change risks are being incorporated and embedded in organisational risk management frameworks andmitigation;climate risks are being considered as part of stress testing; andthe EU taxonomy of sustainable activitiesis being proactively applied.24

1 I. Recent Economic and Price Developments A. Economic Developments I will begin my speech by talking about overseas economies. The growth rates for the April-June quarter of 2020 were substantially negative in many countries due to measures such as lockdowns implemented in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). However, those for the July-September quarter turned significantly positive amid a resumption of economic activity (Chart 1). The pace of economic improvement for the October-December quarter varied across regions and sectors; the growth rates of the United States and China were positive for two consecutive quarters while that of the European Union turned negative due to the tightening of public health measures following a resurgence of COVID-19. As for the outlook, overseas economies are likely to improve, partly supported by aggressive macroeconomic policies, although the pace is likely to be moderate for the time being. Downside risks are high because developments in each country are likely to remain dependent on the course of COVID-19. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation (Chart 2). Exports and production have continued to increase clearly, mainly for automobile-related goods, and also for a wide range of goods, including capital goods and IT-related goods. However, stagnation has become more noticeable again in the nonmanufacturing industry, particularly for face-to-face services, mainly due to a third wave of COVID-19. Business fixed investment continued to decline until the July-September quarter of 2020. Nevertheless, machinery investment by the manufacturing industry has been picking up, reflecting the recovery in exports and production. According to the Bank of Japan's December Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), however, the proportion of firms responding that current business conditions are "unfavorable" continued to exceed the proportion of those responding that they are "favorable." The same result was observed for future business conditions. Sales forecasts for all industries and enterprises for fiscal 2020 declined by almost 10 percent on a year-on-year basis. It is a matter of concern that the year-on-year rate of growth in research and development (R&D) investment plans for all industries and enterprises for fiscal 2020 was negative. Given that the impact of COVID-19 has been 
2 expanding after the release of the Tankan, downside risks to business fixed investment have been significant, mainly in the face-to-face services industry. With regard to the substantial decline in the real GDP growth rate for the April-June quarter of 2020 and the pick-up for the subsequent quarter, it seems that Japan's recovery lacked momentum compared with that in the United States and Europe (Chart 3). A comparison shows that domestic demand components, such as business fixed investment and private consumption, have been relatively weak in Japan compared with those of the United States in particular (Chart 4). The relative weakness in private consumption in Japan could be attributable to the fact that there is a large population of seniors, who remain strongly vigilant against COVID-19. Such weakness in business fixed investment could be because Japanese firms have not been as active as U.S. firms in making digital investments. In my view, the lack of momentum in economic recovery in Japan is due to various challenges it has been facing for a long time. I will return to this later. B. Price Developments Let me move on to price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, or the core CPI, has been negative since spring 2020, when the impact of COVID-19 intensified (Chart 5). Its recent decrease is partly affected by the past decline in crude oil prices and a discount on hotel charges through the "Go To Travel" campaign -- the government's program to promote domestic tourism. These factors are likely to eventually push up the CPI, mainly through a rise in the purchasing power of consumers. It is becoming increasingly important to clearly identify and examine demand trends of individual items composing the CPI baskets and information gained through interviews with firms and individuals, instead of focusing solely on the fact that the core CPI has been negative. For instance, the December 2020 Opinion Survey on the General Public's Views and Behavior shows that the proportion of respondents who answered that prices have gone up compared with one year ago and of those who answered that prices would go up one year from now were both about 60 percent. Less than 10 percent of respondents answered that prices would go down for the same question (Chart 6). Based on the survey results and other information, price cuts that decrease value-added of firms have not been observed widely yet. 
3 C. Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices Now I would like to explain the Policy Board members' baseline scenario regarding the outlook for economic activity and prices. Japan's economy is likely to follow an improving trend with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, but the pace is expected to be only moderate. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. Given these factors, in the Bank's January 2021 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), the forecasts of the majority of Policy Board members for the real GDP growth rate are in the range of minus 5.7 to minus 5.4 percent, 3.3 to 4.0 percent, and 1.5 to 2.0 percent for fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively (Chart 7). As for the outlook for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by a widening of the negative output gap and the temporary price declines that I noted earlier. Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, since downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement and as the effects of such factors as the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate. In the January Outlook Report, the forecasts of the majority of Policy Board members for the year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI are in the range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.5 percent, 0.3 to 0.5 percent, and 0.7 to 0.8 percent for fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively (Chart 7). The risk of an overall and sustained decline in prices is judged as not significant at present. However, the level of corporate profits is expected to be lower than that prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and the employment and income situation is likely to remain weak for the time being. This is because it is more likely to take time for the economy to recover, mainly for the nonmanufacturing industry, due to the recent resurgence of COVID-19. In addition, a decline in actual prices is prone to have stronger effects on people's perception of prices in Japan than in the United States and Europe, given that Japan suffered from prolonged deflation. Taking these factors into account, price developments continue to warrant attention. 
4 II.Conduct of Monetary PolicyLet me now turn to the Bank's policy conduct. The Bank has conducted powerful monetary easing since March 2020 in response to COVID-19 through the following three measures (Chart 8). The first is the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (the Special Program) to provide support, mainly for corporate financing. The second is an ample and flexible provision of funds, mainly by purchasing Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations. The third is active purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) to lower risk premia in asset markets.The Bank's responses have had positive effects, coupled with the government's measures and active efforts by financial institutions. Some nervousness has been seen in financial markets recently, while there remain various uncertainties. However, tension has eased compared with the spring and summer period of 2020. Firms' financial positions are no longer deteriorating, although they have been weak, and the environment for funding, such as bank borrowing as well as the issuance of CP and corporate bonds, has remained accommodative. Thus, the smooth functioning of financial intermediation has been ensured, and this is a big difference from the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), when downward pressure from the financial side on the real economy intensified. However, downward pressure on economic activity and prices due to the impact of COVID-19 is likely to persist. Given this situation, the Bank decided at the December 2020 Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) to extend the duration of the Special Program until the end of September 2021 and to conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In summer 2016, three years after the introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) in 2013, the Bank conducted a comprehensive assessment to examine its effects. The findings indicate that, (1) under the large-scale monetary easing, financial conditions improved significantly, as seen in the correction of the past excessive appreciation 
5 of the yen and decline in stock prices, and that (2) this led to improvement in business performance and economic activity. On the other hand, findings with regard to prices reveal the following points. First, although the economy is no longer in deflation in the sense of a sustained decline in prices, the CPI has not reached the price stability target of 2 percent. Second, people's mindset and behavior based on the assumption that prices will not increase easily have been deeply entrenched under prolonged deflation, and it will still take a long time for such mindset and behavior to change. In addition, the findings also confirm that monetary easing could have a cumulative negative impact on financial institutions' profits as well as on the investment income of life insurance companies and pension funds, which in turn could adversely affect the functioning of financial intermediation. As a policy response based on these findings of the comprehensive assessment, the Bank introduced yield curve control in September 2016. Through this framework, it controls policy interest rates to appropriate levels while taking into consideration both the positive and side effects of monetary easing. Also, in July 2018, the Bank, with a view to persistently continuing with powerful monetary easing, shifted to more flexible market operations and asset purchases so that long-term interest rates may move upward and downward to some extent and the amounts of its ETF and J-REIT purchases may increase or decrease depending on market conditions. The upcoming assessment of monetary easing measures is driven by the same motivations as the comprehensive assessment. The current framework of QQE with Yield Curve Control has been working well for about four years since its introduction, including the COVID-19 era. The Bank, under this framework, will assess whether operational practices and the policy tools, including various asset purchases, have had their intended effects. Furthermore, because monetary easing inevitably will be prolonged due to the lingering impact of COVID-19, the Bank is open to any options in pursuit of further effective and sustainable monetary easing. As the findings of the assessment are scheduled to be made public at the March MPM, I cannot draw any conclusions in advance. However, let me express my views on ETF purchases. In Japan, based on past experience, a destabilization of the stock market tends to 
6 bring about a deflationary mindset. Given this unique factor, I think ETF purchases have been effective in dispelling such mindset and will continue to be a necessary policy tool. That said, it is necessary to bear in mind that large-scale purchases and prolonged holding of assets -- not limited to ETFs -- could affect market functioning. While I will continue to consider the details of a possible response with careful examination of the effects and side effects, it is important to be prepared to respond in a timely and effective manner to counter possible changes in economic activity and prices, as well as financial conditions. III.Challenges Facing Japan's Economy and the Need to Strengthen Growth PotentialA. Challenges Facing Japan's Economy Next, I would like to talk about the challenges facing Japan's economy from a longer-term perspective. Up until the 1985 Plaza Accord, the yen remained weak against the U.S. dollar despite the first and second petroleum crises. In that situation, Japanese firms concentrated their fixed investment exclusively in Japan and enhanced rationalization and efficiency. Thus, Japan became a so-called processing trade country, leveraging strong price competitiveness to drive exports and acquiring foreign currency. The driven exports increased corporate profits and household income, which were eventually poured into financial institutions as deposits and then passed on to firms, mainly to be used for fixed and R&D investments. Consequently, a virtuous cycle operated in the Japanese industry. With this in place, firms and employees built a "win-win" relationship, in which firms gave employees a sense of assurance that their wages would rise constantly based on lifetime employment and seniority-based wages, and employees contributed to improving business performance with a sense of loyalty to their firms. At the same time, a unique culture took root in Japan -- namely, whereby "diligence" and an emphasis on "group over individual" were considered important. After the Plaza Accord, in the latter half of the 1980s, the yen appreciated against the U.S. dollar from around 230 yen per dollar to the level of 120 yen. Then, under circumstances in which Japan had to grapple with the non-performing loan problem after the bursting of the bubble economy, there was a rise in newly industrialized economies with strong price competitiveness that was realized through exploiting their cheap labor. Furthermore, Japan's 
7 population was rapidly aging and its birth rate was declining; the working age population began to decrease after reaching its peak in 1995. With these changes surrounding the Japanese industry taking place, the existing business structure was no longer able to sustain firms' price competitiveness. Japanese firms thus faced the need to bolster their innovation capabilities and reform the industrial structure. However, the traditional employment practices and working style were slow to be changed. Many firms chose squeezing fixed expenses as the main cost reduction measure in case their earnings deteriorated. Therefore, their labor and depreciation cost reduction was prioritized and the realignment of their business portfolio, which would enhance their value-added, was postponed. As a result, these firms continued to maintain low-profit or less-competitive businesses. Their investment was distortedly affected -- R&D investment, for instance -- and they delayed strengthening their promising businesses. Furthermore, along with waning profitability, I think that firms have been biased further toward avoiding risks for fear of occurrence of unexpected major economic shocks. It seems that the combination of these factors has led to a 30-year slump in productivity and to low growth, and Japan has been left behind in the tide of global growth. Looking at trends in Japanese enterprises' labor productivity by size, that of large enterprises, after marking a significant decline due to the GFC, finally surpassed in fiscal 2018 the fiscal 2007 level. On the other hand, labor productivity of medium-sized enterprises and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) only showed a small decline at the time of the GFC. However, the improvement observed thereafter for both types of enterprises has been only moderate, and thus not strong enough to drive the productivity growth of Japan's economy as a whole (Chart 9). B. Changes in Economic Conditions and the Need for Structural Reforms Japan faces major changes, such as digitalization and carbon reduction. As digitalization progresses further, people will be free from time and space constraints. In Society 5.0 -- the concept of a future society proposed by the Japanese government -- cyber and real space will be highly integrated. In such a society, overcoming challenges and creating new value will be more appreciated, not just increasing business scale and efficiency. With regard to carbon 
8 reduction, the automobile industry, which has underpinned Japan's growth and employment for many years, is confronted with the worldwide trend toward ending new sales of gasoline-powered vehicles. As electric vehicles come to be used widely, it seems possible that the market environment could change drastically into a highly commoditized or digital-oriented one. Under these circumstances, the Japanese government declared in its action plan1 that the next driving forces of growth would be digital and green areas, and that it would support reinforcement of Japan's R&D capabilities in the long term to this end. The government also made clear its aim to create an environment where startups and SMEs in Japan grow, and to support SMEs' efforts to raise productivity, grow larger, and take on the challenge of entering overseas markets. In fact, deregulation and market expansion through free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will create a prime opportunity for Japan, which faces a population decline and other structural issues. Now that drastic changes are occurring in the environment, it is crucial for firms to enhance innovation capabilities, be one step ahead in pursuing change, and realize growth. To this end, it will be important to realize an expansion in business scale by strengthening business foundations, as set forth by the government.2 Firms have been taking the initiative in view of the pressing need for digital utilization, as well as reforms to employment practices, working styles, and business portfolios. In other words, transformation of the typical Japanese style of doing business has begun to progress. For instance, an increasing number of firms have been promoting greater mobility in employment and shifting to job-based employment and performance-based wage systems. In addition, some firms have been pursuing business realignment and integration beyond corporate boundaries, acquisitions and divestitures, and business alliances. I expect that restructuring of business portfolios will move forward, thereby enhancing productivity through creation of value-added and business growth. 1 The action plan was decided at the Committee on the Growth Strategy on December 1, 2020. 2 See footnote 1. 
9 C. Need for the Growth of SMEs Since GDP is the sum of value-added through firms' business activities, I think it necessary in terms of Japan's future growth to increase the productivity and value-added of firms. To this end, as a driver of economic growth, it is essential for an increasing number of startups and SMEs to grow larger; for example, startups being developed into so-called unicorns with a valuation of over 1 billion U.S. dollars. According to a report by a U.S. research company, there are 518 unicorns in the world; 249, about half of the total, are in the United States, followed by 122 in China. There are only four unicorns in Japan, compared with 13, 26, and 11 in Germany, India, and South Korea, respectively, although Japan's economic scale is bigger than that of those countries (Chart 10). This suggests that technologies and services that can be one step ahead to respond to changes in the economic environment, such as fintech and online services, are attracting investment funds for growth. It is not an easy task to achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value. From my own experience in management, I can say that, in order to turn environmental change into opportunity, firms need to strengthen their business resources not by relying solely on their own resources but by making effective use of personnel with different backgrounds and knowledge. They also need to take the lead in pursuing change and to reform their business structure without delay, and thereby realize growth. To this end, it is important to carry out deregulation aimed at facilitating free business activities and to create a market in which firms can obtain ample investment funds that enable them to implement their growth strategies and thereby achieve sustainable growth. In what follows, I talk about the roles both direct and indirect financing are expected to play in terms of firms' fund raising. D. Expected Roles for Direct Financing First, let me talk about direct financing, in which firms issue stocks to raise funds directly. As of the end of September 2020, Japanese households held about 1,900 trillion yen in financial assets, of which about 1,000 trillion yen was in cash and deposits and about 500 trillion yen 
10 was in insurance and pension plans. This means that, while a great deal of money is poured into financial institutions, not much flows directly to firms actually doing business. Funds raised through initial public offerings (IPOs) and public offerings (POs) in Japan in 2019 remained small, amounting to about 10 billion U.S. dollars, which is only one tenth of the amount raised in the United States. In addition, looking at venture investment by investment funds, the amount of funds invested by venture capital (VC) funds in the United States in 2020 was 16 trillion yen (156.2 billion U.S. dollars), continuing to increase even during the COVID-19 pandemic.3 On the other hand, in Japan, the amount invested by VC funds in 2019 was about 200 billion yen, and there was a decline of about 30 percent for the January-September period of 2020 compared to a year earlier.4 In the United States, where ample funds flow to firms, startups with disruptive technologies and business models bolster their innovation capabilities by steadily raising funds, and some of them become unicorns. Such unicorns continue to raise funds directly from financial markets even after going public, eventually growing into major firms. On the other hand, in Japan, the total market capitalization of firms listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) at the end of 2020 amounted to 667 trillion yen, exceeding 591 trillion yen at the end of 1989, which was within the bubble period.5 Over the same time frame, the number of listed firms increased by about 1,000. This suggests that listed firms as a whole have not achieved growth in terms of the average capitalization per firm. Market capitalization reflects investors' growth expectations. For those expectations to be grounded in fundamentals, listed firms have to realize investors' growth expectations and raise investment funds to this end. 3 Based on the data from the U.S. National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook. 4 Based on the data from Venture Enterprise Center. 5 Firms listed on the First Section of the TSE as of the end of 2020 include the 37 firms that listed on July 16, 2013, with the integration of the cash equity markets of the TSE and the Osaka Securities Exchange. 
11 Recently, more cases have started to be seen where overseas investment and VC funds invest in startups in Japan. In this regard, Prime Minister Suga declared in his policy speech the creation of a framework for financial markets that attract green investment at home and from abroad.6 I hope that the direct financing market will increase in size and liquidity as a market in which a wide range of investors supply long-term funds to support firms' growth. I also expect investment for startups by VC funds to be active, mainly because the growth areas of Japan's economy -- namely, digital and green areas -- are clear now. E. Expected Roles for Indirect Financing Next, I would like to touch on indirect financing, in which firms raise funds from financial institutions. Japan's advantage lies in the fact that there is an infrastructure needed for economic growth; that is, necessary working capital and business fixed investment funds are supplied steadily through financial institutions to firms. However, the business environment facing regional financial institutions has grown more challenging due to the impact of COVID-19 in addition to structural factors such as the declining birthrate, aging population, and population outflow, as well as the continued low interest rate environment. Amid these circumstances, the Bank decided in 2020 to introduce the Special Deposit Facility to Enhance the Resilience of the Regional Financial System. The aim of this facility is to encourage regional financial institutions' initiatives to strengthen their business foundations so that they may firmly support regional economies into the future and smoothly fulfill their financial intermediation function. Let me express my view with regard to the regional financial system. While the geographic coverage of regional financial institutions' business is often divided on a prefectural basis, value chains are not. As the population shrinks further and it becomes difficult to achieve business growth only within a limited geographic area, an increasing number of firms are pursuing growth in productivity and business scale. Even if growth-oriented startups and SMEs can provide excellent technologies and services, they lack resources such as personnel, 6 See "Policy Speech by the Prime Minister to the 204th Session of the Diet," delivered on January 18, 2021. 
12 materials, and money, as well as a strong customer base. Thus, to help them address this insufficiency, regional financial institutions are expected to provide high-value services and thereby support local SMEs' sustainable growth while leveraging the information the institutions have on these SMEs, such as their capabilities and growth potential. I think that this initiative is in line with expectations of these institutions' borrowers -- namely, local SMEs. Given that data and information are what create value today, regional financial institutions are expected to expand the data and information networks beyond geographic boundaries and offer the value demanded by their borrowers, such as by providing solutions to the borrowers' business challenges. For regional financial institutions to provide strong and sustained support for local SMEs' initiatives to achieve growth, business integration and mergers are one option for them. At the same time, various other alliances, including partnering with different types of businesses, can also be effective. To give an illustration from this region, let us look at Ryoma Sakamoto, a hero during the closing days of the Tokugawa shogunate who was born in Kochi Prefecture. Even in an era when movement in Japan was strictly regulated, he led the Kameyama Shachū, the equivalent of a modern trading company. With his sights set on the resources and strategies of the Satsuma and Chōshū clans, which were both geographically and temperamentally far removed from one another, Sakamoto helped bring the Satsuma-Chōshū Alliance to realization and developed human resources and networks that ultimately led to Japan's transformation at the Meiji Restoration. My hope is that Kochi Prefecture today will see further movement toward transformation. With an eye on the post-COVID-19 era, both direct and indirect financing play a major role in efforts to increase the productivity and business scale of SMEs, including startups. It is necessary for the risk money markets to harness their expertise, particularly in terms of business growth potential, and for banks and other financial institutions to harness theirs in terms of business sustainability. I expect to see increased interaction between business managers and the markets, a shift in the mindset of managers toward a focus on sustainable growth, proactive procurement of investment funds for growth, and reforms to business 
13 models and portfolios. I hope that these factors will increase productivity in the economy as a whole. At present, the management and staff of all firms, SMEs in particular, have been making strenuous efforts to address a significant environmental change caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the global economy has experienced a period of prolonged low growth following a major shock, governments and central banks around the world have made every effort to prevent as much as possible the COVID-19 shock from creating "scarring effects," which are long-lasting aftereffects on the economy. On the other hand, when facing a significant change, firms can achieve substantial growth by being one step ahead and turning such change into opportunity. Although Japan suffered from prolonged low growth and deflation, I expect that its long-standing challenges that are attracting closer attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic will finally be resolved at this time, and the Bank will encourage such efforts through monetary easing measures. Thank you.

Marzunisham Omar: Digital ID/e-KYC and Financing and Facilitationof Foreign Terrorist FightersWelcoming remarks by Mr Marzunisham Omar, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank ofMalaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia), at the 22nd Asia/Pacific Group (APG) on Money LaunderingTypologies Workshop, virtual, 2 February 2021.*   *   *It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to the first virtual APG Annual Typologies Workshop thisweek. It is rather unfortunate that I cannot personally host you in Kuala Lumpur for this event.I have recently assumed the role of APG Co-Chair, representing Malaysia. Malaysia is indeedvery honoured to co-chair the APG and we are committed to working together with all membersin delivering the APG’s mandates during this unprecedented and challenging times. It is my wishthat during my tenure as Co-Chair, we would be able to further strengthen the strategicpartnership amongst APG members and foster better collaboration in implementing the APGinitiatives and agenda. Together with the APG Secretariat, we will continue to provide platformsfor members to raise any issues affecting individual members as well as collectively as a group.For this purpose, together with Co-Chair Ian, we have identified several focus areas as the Co-Chairs’ Priorities, one of which is to host the Annual Typologies Workshop.Despite the pandemic and after a two-year hiatus, we are glad to be able to conduct the APGTypologies Workshop although in a virtual setting. So far, 21 APG Typologies Workshops havebeen held since the APG’s formation in 1997, where the last Workshop was held in 2018, jointlywith the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG) inRussia. These Workshops have contributed to a better comprehension of prevalent moneylaundering and terrorism financing (ML/TF) threats in the region, by allowing members tounderstand latest trends, identify key red flags as well as sharing of information on possiblecounter-measures to respond to the threats. This has assisted members to take the harddecisions to prioritise, apply resources and put in place systems to effectively tackle financialcrimes.With so much benefits, the APG is committed to continue holding the Annual TypologiesWorkshop so that members could keep abreast with the latest ML/TF trends and typologies. Asyou can see in the agenda, this year’s Workshop aims to discuss two key areas that wereapproved by the membership earlier. These two topics namely, Digital ID/e-KYC and Financingand Facilitation of Foreign Terrorist Fighters, are timely given the current development in ourregion.Allow me to touch briefly on these two topics.Digital ID/e-KYCThe rapid technology advancement in the last decade has led to significant innovations in thefinancial sector. Then came the COVID-19 pandemic, which has accelerated the need forfinancial institutions around the world to shift their operations onto the digitalised platforms.Digital ID/e-KYC is one such innovation and the authorities have responded accordingly. Forexample:AML/CFT regulators, such as Bangladesh, Hong Kong, India and Malaysia, have startedintroducing guidelines and policies on e-KYC; andGovernments have also started exploring the establishment of digital ID platforms to facilitatee-KYC, as seen in Singapore and Thailand among others. 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
A conversation on this subject is also timely in view of the recent issuance of the Financial ActionTask Force’s (FATF) Guidance on Digital Identity in March 2020. Participants should seize theoccasion to share experience in facilitating the adoption of e-KYC while ensuring compliance withthe relevant FATF Standards.As technology enhances the efficiency of the financial sector, I have no doubt that the shifttowards digitalisation will continue to accelerate. We as regulators should strive to facilitate thistransformation while being cognisant and vigilant of the risks that this can pose to the stabilityand integrity of the financial system, including ML/TF risks. In this respect, authorities could playour part by ensuring that all AML/CFT measures remain relevant and appropriate as well asassisting the financial institutions in complying with AML/CFT requirements. As regulators, it isimperative for us to strike a fine balance between facilitating innovation and safeguarding ourfinancial system from any form of abuse.Financing and Facilitation of Foreign Terrorists FightersAs approved in the APG 2019 Annual Meeting, APG has collaborated with the Global Centre onCooperative Security, towards producing a typology report on financial profiles of foreign fightersand returnees in Southeast Asia. This report comes at an opportune time as there have beengrowing concerns that terrorist groups are using the pandemic outbreak to advance theirpropaganda and fundraising efforts.Although the risk seems muted at the moment due to strengthened border enforcement, onlineactivities and financial transactions related to terrorism could easily go under the radar ofauthorities. This bolsters the continuous need to better understand and profile key playersinvolved in the furtherance of terrorism financing activities. I believe that the typology report andalso discussion during this Workshop will help us to close gaps and reduce our blind spots.As we progress, financial crimes will continue to evolve and take on more complex forms. Assuch, we should remind ourselves to not let our guards down. The fight against terrorism is ashared battle and it must always be our collective priority. This can only be successfullyconquered through the sharing of information between members.ConclusionAs we face unprecedented times, we are bound to encounter unknown challenges. Thus, thereis a need for all of us to stay prepared, agile and responsive in facing those threats. Collaborationamongst us, through sharing of information and experience, will further strengthen our collectivereadiness to address the ML/TF risks.I note that a diverse mix of participants including from the private sectors have registered for theWorkshop which will no doubt enrich the discourse this week. I hope all of you will be able todraw new insights and perspective as well as leverage on the initiatives and best practicesshared in this Workshop, potentially to emulate it in your respective jurisdictions. For your benefit,the Secretariat will upload the relevant presentation materials and outcome report on the APGwebsite after the conclusion of the Workshop. I would also like to encourage any further dialoguebetween the delegates on these issues post the Workshop and I am sure the Secretariat will beable to assist in connecting the delegates.There will no doubt be challenges in networking under a virtual setting, but these are the ‘newnormal and conditions’ that the more we are accustomed to, the more we are able to adapt. TheAPG itself is still in the initial phase of using the virtual platforms and the Secretariat wouldappreciate any feedback on how to improve this further.In line with the APG Co-Chairs’ Priorities, we are also continuously working with the Secretariatto deliver more capacity building initiatives for the members, especially in the areas of Public- 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Private Partnership (PPP), DNFBPs Supervision and Data Analytics.Before I conclude my remarks, let me take this opportunity to thank the APG Secretariat inorganising this Workshop and all partners, including the Alliance for Financial Stability withInformation Technology, and the Global Centre on Cooperative Security. Special thanks as wellto the speakers and discussants from the APG members and observers. On that note, I wishyou a successful Workshop and I look forward to meeting you in person soon in the APG futureevents. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Elvira Nabiullina: Review of recent inflation developments in Russiaand economic outlookStatement by Ms Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, in the follow-up to the Boardof Directors meeting, Moscow, 12 February 2021.*   *   *Today, we have decided to keep the key rate at 4.25% per annum.The economy is bouncing back rather steadily. I would like to remind you that at our previousmeeting we expected economic revival to pause at the end of 2020. However, GDP statisticsand high-frequency indicators evidence that this did not happen. Moreover, inflation also exceedsour expectations.I will further on dwell on the factors, which we were taking into account when making our decisiontoday.I will start out with the situation in the economy. It has turned out to be better thanwe expected, and there is a range of reasons for this. First, the restrictions in autumn and winterwere not as tough as in spring. Second, both households and businesses were better preparedfor the resurgence of coronavirus cases and adjusted faster. Credit activity did not decline,and consumer demand remained unchanged, including owing to a rise in online purchases.Third, external demand for Russian exports also turned out to be higher than our expectations.We assume that demand in the economy will be recovering steadily further on, promotedby lending expansion amid accommodative monetary policy, mass vaccination,and an improvement in household and business sentiment.Over the acute phase of the crisis, budget spending considerably supported the real sector.The effect of stimulus measures is expected to continue in the first half of the year as well.Further on, the scheduled fiscal policy normalisation will reduce the extent of this influence.Nonetheless, the budget will remain expansionary as compared to the long-term parametersprovided for by the fiscal rule.In these conditions, economic growth will continue owing to a further revival of both domesticand external demand. The recovery of domestic demand will be driven by the cancellationof restrictions as the epidemic situation improves, especially in the service sector. Externaldemand will be boosted by a rebound in the global economy. Disinflationary demand-sidepressure will thus be decreasing overall.Given the current positive trends, we keep unchanged our forecast of GDP growth at 3–4% for 2021. Furthermore, the economy may reach its pre-pandemic levels already by late 2021,and not by mid-2022, as we assumed earlier. This will become possible primarily as a resultof a less significant decline in 2020.The second factor is inflation. Annual inflation sped up to 5.2% in January, exceeding the Bankof Russia’s target. This elevated inflation rate largely resulted from the pass-through of the rubleweakening and price growth in global commodity markets. According to our estimates,the contribution of the pass-through of the exchange rate movements to annual inflationapproximated one percentage point. The contribution of high prices in food markets was slightlylower yet substantial. Given increased inflation expectations and supply-side restrictions, thesefactors may have a longer-lasting effect on prices.The pass-through of last year’s ruble depreciation to prices still continues, although it is waning.Recently, prices could be affected not only by ruble exchange rate fluctuations in 2020 H2, 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
but also its weakening in spring, when enterprises were unable to revise their prices immediatelydue to a slump in demand. Eventually, the combination of the two episodes of the rubledepreciation may be a reason why inflation expectations will stay elevated for a longer period.Upward pressure on domestic prices persists due to the situation in global commodity markets,first and foremost in food markets. Food prices have risen because of reduced inventoriesand unfavourable weather conditions. Moreover, the growth of prices for cereals increases costsin meat product manufacturing and is not only a proinflationary factor in itself, but it may alsoentail secondary effects. It is worth noting that the new mechanism of export duties in grainmarkets will smooth out the influence of global price fluctuations on domestic prices.Finally, inflation is still affected by a group of factors associated with the epidemic situation.It includes staff shortages in a number of industries, increased costs incurred by companiesto comply with sanitary and epidemiological rules, and persistent temporary delays in suppliesdue to disruptions in logistics chains. These are supply-side factors putting upward pressureon inflation.Given the nature of these processes, we estimate that annual inflation will pass its peakin February—March, after which it will be going down incrementally. This will become possibleas the impact of the above proinflationary factors is gradually exhausted. Beginning from March,the statistical base effect will also play a significant role in the decrease in annual inflation. Takinginto account the monetary policy pursued, we forecast that prices will grow by 3.7%—4.2% overthe year.The third factor we were taking into account when making our today’s decision is thatmonetary conditions remain accommodative. While nominal interest rates on loansand deposits changed only slightly, real price conditions were eased. Banks also continuedto ease non-price lending conditions in a range of segments. Yields on federal government bondsincreased somewhat amid the growth of long-term interest rates in global financial markets.Owing to the monetary policy pursued and the Government’s anti-crisis support measures,the increase in the banking system’s claims on companies accelerated to 10.2% last year, whichis more than in 2019. The growth rate of claims on households equalled 12.9%. The economyand borrowers obtained the funds they needed to more smoothly overcome the acute phaseof the crisis and resume development.In 2021, monetary conditions will remain accommodative, further promoting lending expansion,despite the expected gradual termination of preferential programmes. The banking system’sclaims on companies are forecast to increase by 7–11% this year, and those on households —by 14–18%, largely as a result of the accelerated expansion of mortgage lending.As regards fluctuations in banking sector liquidity observed in recent months, they had no impacton monetary conditions. As before, the Bank of Russia preserved money market rates closeto the key rate. This became possible owing to the streamlined operational procedure whichis efficient amid both a deficit and a surplus of liquidity.Today, we have published the Bank of Russia’s updated baseline forecast. It relieson the following assumptions:First of all, external conditions have become more promising. The global economy is expectedto grow faster owing to mass vaccination and additional fiscal stimuli in advanced economies.This will strengthen external demand for Russian exports. Therefore, we have increasedour forecast of oil prices from 45 to 50 US dollars per barrel for 2021 and 2022. Nonetheless,our forecast remains conservative given the high uncertainty about a potential further spreadof the pandemic. According to our estimates, a faster recovery of the demandfor oil may translate to a greater extent into a rise in oil output rather than oil prices. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
As regards the 2022–2023 horizon, our forecast remains unchanged. The economy willexpand by 2.5–3.5% in 2022 and by 2–3% in 2023. Given the monetary policy pursued, inflationwill return to the target at the end of 2021 and stay close to 4% further on.I will now speak on possible risks to the forecast. Disinflationary risks do not prevailany longer in 2021. Moreover, this is generally a balance between proinflationaryand disinflationary risks over the forecast horizon.Proinflationary risks include, first and foremost, a possible rise in prices in globalcommodity markets. Second, the epidemic situation remains one of the least predictablefactors. Its potential worsening will be the reason why companies’ costs will stay high,with goods transportation problems and production chain disruptions persisting. Third,inflation expectations may remain elevated for a long period of time. Fourth, it is worthemphasising that economic rebound may be uneven and involve local price spikes in individualsegments. For instance, as restrictions are lifted in the service sector hardesthit by the pandemic, an increase in demand amid an insufficient rise in supply may becomea temporary proinflationary factor. The scale and duration of its impact will dependon a new balance between demand and supply, households’ behaviour, changes in consumerpreferences, and the pace of the cancellation of restrictions on foreign travels. Fifth, we still takeinto account persistent geopolitical risks as they may affect yield trends and inflationand exchange rate expectations.The second group of risks include disinflationary factors.  First of all, the fiscal policynormalisation may have a more significant influence on final demand and, accordingly, pricemovements. Second, the uncertainty regarding future consumer behaviour remains. Duringthe quarantine and long self-isolation period, a lot of people abandoned some services,formed new consumption preferences, and changed their mode of life. We do not knowwhether they will become steady and how they will be influencing price trends. Third, afterthe boundaries are reopened, it is natural to expect that the demand will shift towards outboundtourism services. As labour migrant flows and logistics chains restore, this will becomea disinflationary factor. Finally, as the restrictions are eased, companies will be ableto reduce their costs for the sanitation of their premises and the anti-pandemicprotection of their staff and customers, which will ease pressures on businesses’ costs.In conclusion, I would like to comment on monetary policy prospects. The accommodativemonetary policy and the Government’s package of anti-crisis measures have been promotingeconomic revival after the acute phase of the crisis. According to our estimates, we consider thatthe potential for monetary policy easing has been exhausted. Its further easing could additionallyincrease proinflationary risks. Nonetheless, monetary policy will remain accommodativeon average throughout 2021, supporting the recovery of the Russian economy. The baselinescenario provides for a gradual return to neutral monetary policy. We will assess the timelineand pace for this return taking into account our goal to maintain inflation at our target. 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Gabriel Makhlouf: Leading through the pandemicIntroductory remarks by Mr Gabriel Makhlouf, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, at theGrant Thornton Leaders Lounge Event, 16 February 2021.*   *   *Good morning, it is a pleasure to participate in this event and I look forward to discussing both theimportance of leadership and some of the challenges for leaders, the ones we’ve faced and theones ahead of us.Looking backLast year was extremely difficult for people all over the world. The public health emergency was,and remains, severe, although thankfully great progress has been made on a vaccine. But westill have a way to travel to return to some semblance of normality, or perhaps a ‘new normal’.Thinking back to 2019, I could not have imagined the pace of technological adaptation that wasjust around the corner, with millions of people working regularly from home, videoconferencing,shopping and learning online.  I expect some of these changes will outlast the virus.This crisis is very different to that of the financial and sovereign debt crisis.  It is first andforemost a health crisis. The economic crisis arising from the pandemic has, to my knowledge,no precedent in modern history. I have still not found examples of economies voluntarily closingdown in the way so much of the world has chosen to.An important difference to what we experienced ten years ago is the fact that the financialsystem has been able – so far at least – to absorb rather than amplify the effects of the shock.The Government also has had significant resources available to respond to the pandemic, withthe rise in the deficit and debt ratios both warranted and necessary.Policy therefore has been in a position to support the productive capacity of the economy andavoid scarring effects such as long-term unemployment. Nonetheless, the more prolonged theneed for measures to contain the pandemic, the greater the risk that liquidity problems will evolveinto solvency pressures for affected businesses, increased risk of financial difficulties forhouseholds, and greater challenges for the financial system and wider economy.The enormity of the policy response is visible in the data. For example, at its peak lastyear, approximately 1.2 million people in Ireland were in receipt of some form of income support.Despite this response, we estimate unemployment is likely to increase from 6.2 per cent in 2020to an average of 9.3 per cent this year before declining to 7.8 per cent in 2022, a rate well abovethe pre-pandemic level of about 5 per cent.  Though high, for comparison, the unemploymentrate peaked at just over 16 per cent a decade ago.The work of the Central BankFrom the outset, we have prioritised dealing with the pandemic’s impact on the financial systemand on consumers. Our near-term crisis response has been focused on the financial systembeing able to support households and businesses through the pandemic and into the recovery.And this has different dimensions. For monetary policy, we have worked with our Eurosystemcolleagues to maintain favourable financing conditions for all sectors of the economy and acrossthe euro area. Our macro-prudential policy stance in Ireland is intended to enable the financialsystem to absorb losses from the shock and maintain the supply of lending to households andbusinesses, supporting the recovery. And we’re focused on the approach of the financial systemto managing distressed debt, including that related to pre-existing mortgage arrears. 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Looking ahead, what happens to household savings will be important for the Irish economy asindividuals and households may choose to use them for consumption in the future whencircumstances allow. And the relative resilience of the public finances overall should contribute toeconomic recovery in 2021 as we hope that widespread vaccinations allow the economy to startfunctioning without restrictions once more.As I discussed last week, rebuilding and strengthening this resilience is a key priority for theCentral Bank.Leading through disruptionNow, perhaps one of the unique experiences that many of us will have had over the last year isleading organisations remotely.  Leadership through the pandemic has brought its challenges. Technology has enabled organisations such as the Central Bank – where work can be doneremotely – to continue to operate.  But as time has gone on, the drawbacks to building andmaintaining the relationships and social capital that contribute to a successful organisationbecome apparent.As Governor of the Central Bank, my number one priority has been the care of our people.Fighting an invisible virus has created enormous anxiety for everyone in the community and it isno different to people who work for us.  A radical shift in working arrangements has beenaccompanied with added caring and teaching responsibilities (in many cases at least) along withthe changes in all our normal patterns of social interaction.  The mental and physical wellbeing ofour people has been an important focus for us. We know that it can sometimes be difficult toadmit to ourselves that we need additional help and support. But we all need to ensure we createa culture in our organisations where people know it is OK to ask for help.  Remote working is notan excuse not to listen to our people.Another feature of the pandemic is that it has become very difficult to plan, and certainly difficultto plan our personal lives.  And at a time when the lines of work and home have become veryblurred, it is particularly important that people take leave, and use it to switch to support their ownwellbeing. We have, wherever possible, looked to address the enormous uncertainty around ourdaily lives by giving people as much certainty as we can. For example, before Christmas we toldour people that we would carry on working remotely until at least the end of May, giving themsome certainty to help them plan their lives.  During enormous uncertainty, the clarity and regularity of communications is particularlyimportant.  We are learning to operate in new ways and now thinking about what it means for the longer-term.  We’re exploring what our future working model might look like, what we’ve learned fromthe enforced experiment of the last 11 months, what we should keep and what we should let go,so that we can continue to do our jobs effectively over the long-term.  One my responsibilities isthe stewardship of the Central Bank into that long-term so I am particularly interested on theimpact of remote working over a long time period on collaboration, on the sharing of knowledgeand on the development of an organisation’s social and intellectual capital. Of course there are many leadership challenges to face throughout the pandemic.  Remoteworking is not a possibility for everyone, including some people in the Central Bank.  And formany people across the country, reorganisation or redundancy has been the reality of thedisruption of the last 11 months.  Managing the impact on people is the single biggest leadershipchallenge that we face.I don’t think I am alone in thinking about such issues and look forward to learning how you havemanaged, how your organisations have adapted, and how you see the future. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Claudia Buch: ESRB report on the financial stability implications ofCovid-19 support measures to protect the real economyIntroductory remarks by Prof Claudia Buch, Vice-President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at theESRB Press Briefing, virtual, 16 February 2021.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today’s conference call.The report we present today is novel in two respects:First, the report benefited from the unique data collection on covid-19 related support measuresunder Recommendation ESRB/2020/8 issued by the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) inMay 2020. This support has a total nominal value of around 14% of GDP in the 31 membercountries of the ESRB. The focus is on loans with public guarantees, loan moratoria and directgrants – measures that are particularly relevant for the financial sector. By September 2020 thereported uptake of these programmes was roughly 4% of ESRB member countries’ GDP. Inaddition, around 5% of banks’ total loans were subject to moratoria.Second, the report provides a first assessment of the financial stability implications of the crisis-related measures taken by the 31 member countries. This includes the initial results as well asthe policy priorities that the ESRB has identified as crucial to address the pandemic goingforward.The key finding from the report is that the fiscal response has stabilised both lending and thefinancial system – but risks still lie ahead.First, the report shows that so far the financial system has continued to provide funding to thereal economy and losses in banking books have been contained. The pandemic has intensifiedrisks and vulnerabilities in the real economy. In its initial phase, sectors and households mostaffected by the pandemic were under severe liquidity stress. But prompt action taken bygovernments has provided crucial relief. Fiscal measures have helped to prevent the loss ofviable businesses; moratoria schemes have provided liquidity support. In addition, monetarypolicy has of course played an important role. And regulators used the existing regulatoryflexibility and relaxed bank balance sheet constraints. Indirectly, the fiscal measures haveprotected the financial sector from the impact of the pandemic and ensured the continuedprovision of financial services: Up to 35% of new bank lending to corporates during the pandemichas been subject to those measures.Second, differences in fiscal measures reflect, to a large extent, different exposures of countriesto the pandemic. For example, countries hit harder by the pandemic tend to have largerprogrammes with greater uptake, while countries with a higher share of employment invulnerable sectors rely more on direct grants than on public guarantees. The uptake of moratoriais positively correlated with the pre-crisis debt levels of non-financial corporations andhouseholds. However, the observed heterogeneity also reflects differences in fiscal space and apotential lack of policy coordination.Third, the longer the crisis lasts and the weaker the economic recovery, the greater the risk thatlosses in the non-financial sector could spill over into the financial sector. Eventually, corporateinsolvencies will increase and banks will face higher losses. While there is a high degree ofuncertainty, one cannot rule out an adverse scenario. There could be adverse feedback loops tothe real economy if banks were to deleverage to meet capital requirements imposed byregulators or markets. Cross-border banking activities could be particularly severely affected byany deleveraging. Hence, timely action is therefore required to address evolving vulnerabilities 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
and to increase balance sheet transparency. If banks’ balance sheets were to remain impairedfor an extended period after the crisis, economic recovery and financial stability would be atstake.Let me focus now on the key policy priorities going forward.The ESRB has identified several domains which require attention from policymakers in terms ofthe policy design and coordination, monitoring and transparency and preparedness.First, authorities should avoid cliff effects. If fiscal support is withdrawn prematurely, economicrecovery and financial stability might be at risk. Yet, if support is maintained for too long beyondthe emergency, fiscal sustainability and longer-term growth may be jeopardised. Managing thistrade-off requires access to timely and reliable information on the state of the economy and theeffects of policy measures.Second, it is important to target fiscal measures. Over time, fiscal measures will have to beapplied in a more targeted way. It will be particularly important to balance liquidity versussolvency measures.Third, it is important to coordinate policies across areas and countries. Addressing potentialsolvency issues will require policy responses that are coordinated across several policy areas,including insolvency legislation, labour and social policies, and competition policy.The fourth policy priority the ESRB has identified is to monitor private debt sustainability. Elevateddebt levels for households and firms could become unsustainable if the economic crisis lastslonger than expected. This, in turn, could, also lead to a pronounced accumulation of losses inthe financial sector.The fifth policy priority should be to enhance financial institutions’ balance sheet transparencyand to upgrade reporting. Many standard solvency indicators are misleading, which makes itdifficult to assess the degree of delayed restructuring. Banks’ balance sheet information isheavily impacted by credit guarantees, moratoria and regulatory measures. Timely and prudentrecognition of credit risk is thus necessary to increase the transparency of banks’ balancesheets.Finally, as a sixth priority the ESRB believes it is necessary to prepare for a scenario ofincreased distress in the corporate sector. Institutions administering the restructuring andinsolvency processes should have sufficient capacities to avoid value destruction. Addressingthe issue of non-performing loans as early and decisively as possible is essential to ensure thefinancial system is strong and stable and supports sustainable growth.The report presented today provides much further detail as well as rich empirical evidenceacross the 31 member countries of the ESRB.While we have covered a lot of ground, let me stress that the ESRB will continue its work onCOVID-19 support measures. The ESRB will proceed with regular monitoring the financialstability implications of the pandemic and of the fiscal measures. It will particularly focus oncross-sectoral and cross-country spillovers. It will also monitor the phasing out of measures toensure that support to the economy is maintained while financial stability is preserved. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Gent Sejko: Covid-19 pandemic and monetary policy: all eyes onthe central bank’s balance sheetSpeech by Mr Gent Sejko, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Scientific Conference on“Pandemic and recovery – the coping strategies and expectations”, Tirana, 9 February 2021.*   *   *Covid-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented negative shock and to that extent required anextraordinary response from monetary and fiscal authorities around the globe. In the face of thisshock, central banks have gone beyond the traditional frameworks, by adopting an expansionarymonetary policy to expand the central bank’s balance sheet. This material describes thedilemmas and changes faced by the theory and practice of the monetary policy, as a result of thepandemic pressure on the economy; and analyses the possibility for utilizing these changes indeveloping countries with small open economies, such as Albania. The monetary policy, starting in the USA, in the early 1980s focused on keeping inflation undercontrol and anchoring inflationary expectations through managing the interest rate. For almost 30years, this stance established the premises for stability and sustainable economic growth.However, after the bursting of the financial global crises in 2008, central banks immediately cutthe interest rates, which quickly reached the lower threshold of 0. This rendered the interest rate,as the main instrument of monetary policy, practically useless. In order to re-activate theeconomy, the central banks of advanced economies (Federal Reserve, European Central Bank,Bank of England, and Bank of Japan) conducted massive temporary liquidity injections, bypurchasing securities in capital markets. Even though purchasing programme was thought to betemporary, they were repeated continuously in order to support the economic activity andachieve the objective of prices stability. . This practice drove to the increase of money in theeconomy and the expansion of central banks’ balance sheet. The negative shock caused by the pandemic and the response of authorities to bring it undercontrol, demanded an even higher reaction from monetary policy. Based on the same theoreticalarguments, similar to the financial crises case, central banks injected extraordinary amounts ofliquidity to the economy, , by purchasing every category of debt and mortgage –backed securitiestraded in the market. One year from the outbreak of the pandemic, the four above-mentionedcentral banks, in an explicit or implicit manner, consider the expansionary monetary policythrough the expanding the balance sheet as a permanent instrument of the monetarypolicy. Accepting in their balance sheets even debt and mortgage-backed securities from theprivate sector. Other central banks of advanced countries have also adopted a similar approachcomparably, as required. The application of such unconventional practices has turned all eyes onthe central bank’s balance sheet as a saving instrument from the negative effects of thepandemic.Hence, it is natural that economists are faced with a dilemma whether these unconventionalpractices are appropriate even for small, opened economies, with a high scale of euroisation andweak currencies (meaning that the currencies are not tradeable in international markets). Theanswer provided in this research is: perhaps, but not necessarily! This is becauseunconventional policies carry risks of both monetary and financial nature. I will try to discuss thisissue shortly, using the example of the Albanian economy. Relating to the situation of the Albanian economy during the pandemic, the Bank of Albaniaassesses that the pandemic has delivered a heavy blow to the economic activity, employmentand investments, putting enterprises and households under great strain to meet financial needsand obligations. In response to these shocks, the Bank of Albania has undertaken a set ofmeasures of monetary character through easing the monetary conditions, by reducing theinterest rate and injecting unlimited amount of liquidity to the economy. At the same time, a set of 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
macroprudential measures were implemented to ensure that short-term financial problems ofenterprises and households do not harm the stability of the banking system and do not obstructits intermediary activity and role in the economy. This framework of measures and regulatorychanges are similar to the ones implemented by the European Central Bank and regional centralbanks. The current statistics show that they have played a significant role in mitigating negativeeffects of the pandemic. Consequently, the financing costs of the private sector remain low, theexchange rate is stable and the banking sector shows good liquidity and capital indicators. Incomparison with central banks of advanced countries, the Bank of Albania has not appliedunconventional monetary policy measures in order to expand its balance sheet. Following, I willcontinue to elaborate on the reasons why this approach has not been adopted in Albania.First, and the most important, at the moment of the pandemic outbreak, the monetary policyinterest rate of the Bank of Albania was neither in negative territory, nor close to the zerothreshold. As a result, the monetary policy had considerable space for monetary expansionthrough the decrease of the interest rate in its conventional form. The Bank of Albania deems thateven in the actual moment there is still space to easing the monetary policy, by means ofconventional measures. Second, unconventional policies or the application of new monetary policy concepts (QE), in thecase of the Albanian economy, are mainly limited by the lack of tradeable instruments in thecapital market. The capital market structure in Albania is quite limited and debt and mortgage-backed securities of the private sector are non-existent. Subsequently, the expansion of thebalance sheet of the central bank remains conditioned from the limited size and supply of thefinancial market. Third, without capital markets, the expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet throughpurchasing government securities in the secondary market automatically drives to an increase ofthe public debt; and may continue until public debt reaches the long-term sustainable threshold.The increase of public debt beyond this threshold damages directly and simultaneouslyconfidence in the fiscal and monetary policy, by exposing the country to threats such as financialand balance of payments crises. Overall, the new concepts on the nature and instruments of the monetary policy do not considercertain core principles of sustainability of the intermediate balance sheets of the government,central bank and the economy, in general. These principles expressed in the form of quantitativelimitations are crucial to stable policies for small and opened economies which are developing.The application of such practices that goes unstudied may be dangerous to these economies. In conclusion, the success and utility of the proposed changes to achieve the monetary policyobjectives, is still to be proved in the future by the actual results of central banks, which have alsoapplied the empirical and academic studies. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
1   Nina Stoyanova: Forthcoming new developments in the area of payment services and digitalisation Publication by Ms Nina Stoyanova, Deputy Governor and Head of the Banking Department of the Bulgarian National Bank, in the Quarterly Bulletin of the Association of Banks in Bulgaria, issue 65, January 2021.   Digital technologies have changed the financial services provision business, and the payment sector is the leader in this trend. The speed of development of innovations and the scale of technological changes in it require concrete and targeted effort. The pending strategic projects and directions of development of the European payment infrastructure in the short term, as presented in the digital finance package of the European Commission of November 20201, are related to the development of instant payments, digitalisation of financial services  and support of secure, profitable and interoperable payment solutions within the single market.   1. Forthcoming review of the Second Payment Services Directive In 2021, there will be a review of the Second Payment Services Directive2 (PSD2) adopted in 2015 and transposed in the national legislation at the beginning of 2018 with the new Law on Payment Services and Payment Systems. An analysis of the results of the directive’s implementation is expected to cover the following areas: - Updating the requirements to technical solutions used by payment services providers for strong customer authentication, which are to ensure high level of security to customers, while being convenient and user-friendly. Emphasis will be placed on the so-called ‘non-transmittable’ elements, such as biometrics. This presupposes gradual decrease in the use of elements with lower degree of security, such as static passwords, and limiting the use of older technologies and communication channels that are prone to attacks (such as SMS text messages);  - Prevention of new types of fraud, particularly in the context of instant payments, as well as strengthening payer’s protection and regulating a chargeback procedure in specific cases (e.g. an error), which would make instant payments come close to card transactions;  - Review of the possible exceptions from applying strong customer authentication, such as contactless card payments, also exploring the possibilities for introduction of an individual limit set by the customer, for which no PIN entry is required; - Potential measures to reduce the risk of fraud due to ‘social engineering’ or ‘targeted phishing’, with a possible requirement for a match between the names of the payee to the payment transaction and the account holder, and the implementation of technological solutions for validation of the e-mail correspondence sender;  - Possibility for additional standardisation in terms of the information provided to users in their account statements, particularly for card payments. The sophisticated business models using multiple intermediaries result in users’ confusion, e.g. where the name of a merchant from  the account statement does not coincide with the merchant’s trademark and thus hinders the identification of unauthorised payment transactions;                                                            1 https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/200924-digital-finance-proposals_en  2 Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC 
2  - Unifying the regulatory regime applicable to electronic money institutions and payment institutions, by repealing the Electronic Money Directive3, and including issuance of electronic money as a new type of a payment service;  - Standardisation of the application programming interfaces (APIs) used by the industry. Regulation of the concept of the so-called ‘open finances’- access to financial and non-financial institutions to a broad range of financial information regarding the customers with the latter’s consent with a view the provision of innovative services is expected to be proposed by mid-2022 building on the experience gained in the implementation of ‘open banking’; - Review of the services falling within the remit of the Directive. Presently, PSD2 does not cover services provided by ‘technical services providers’, who support the provision of payment services without coming into possession of the funds. Due to the growing dependence of the provision of payment services on the provision of outsourced ancillary services by subcontractors that are currently non-regulated entities, some of these services and their providers may possibly be included in the scope of the Directive and become subject of supervision; - In addition to the review of PSD2, a review will also be carried out of the Settlement Finality Directive4, and assessment will be made if payment institutions and electronic money institutions should be eligible for direct participation in designated payments systems, subject to certain conditions and risk mitigating measures.   2. General trends in payment digitalisation Amendments to the legislation are an important prerequisite for the quick take-up of innovations in the market, but no less contribution to it have the standardisation activities pursued by the industry itself. Main developments, trends and technologies in the payment area, as well as the required regulatory activities, will cover: - Standardisation and achievement of interoperability between end-user applications used for payment transactions, including standardisation of the QR codes used in Europe;  - Expanding the access to the necessary technical infrastructure for payment execution – e.g. to NFC chips in mobile phones and to the kernels for contactless payments in POS terminals, thus facilitating contactless payments with cards issued within national card schemes in the EU Member States; - Encouraging the use of electronic identity and solutions based on trust services, improvement of electronic identification and trust services with a view to meeting the requirements for strong customer authentication and other regulatory requirements; - Improved acceptance of digital payments by both the public and private sector, including by legislative amendments in 2022, if needed; - Standardisation of additional functionalities by establishing special SEPA schemes aimed at greater convenience in initiating instant payments, such as the services ‘request-to-pay’, payment by mobile phone number (proxy look-up), electronic invoice and electronic receipt, etc.;  - Ensuring the full potential of the SEPA project and the strict application of the requirements of Regulation (EU) 260/20125, including the requirements against IBAN                                                            3 Directive 2009/110/ЕC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on the taking up, pursuit and prudential supervision of the business of electronic money institutions amending Directives 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 2000/46/EC 4 Directive 98/26/ЕC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems  5 Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2012 laying down technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and amending Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 
3  discrimination (inability to initiate international payment transactions) in the execution of direct debits; - Assessing the possibility for Western Balkan countries to join SEPA, thus deepening their convergence with the EU; - More comprehensive implementation of global international standards, such as ISO 20022, which facilitate the inclusion of richer data in the payment messages by the end of 2022 at the latest.  3. Forthcoming developments in the field of immediate payments  Instant credit transfers are the basis on which pan-European payment solutions are expected to be built. Combined with the development of mobile technologies, instant payments have the potential to create affordable, convenient and secure payment solutions in both physical stores and the Internet, with funds being available to the recipient within seconds. The ambition is to complete the full introduction of instant payments in the European Union by the end of 2021. The following steps are needed to achieve this goal:  - Assess the need for mandatory adherence to the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme in euro (SCT Inst.) by the end of 2021 and determining the criteria according to which payment service providers will be subject by this obligation; - Assess whether to adopt a legislative prohibition on charging instant payments higher than standard credit transfers; - Ensuring cross-border connectivity and interoperability of payment systems for instant payments in euro through the TIPS service of the ECB-operated TARGET 2 payment system. All payment service providers that have joined the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme (SCT Inst.) and are reachable in TARGET 2, should be reachable either as a participant or as an reachable party (i.e., through another payment service provider that is a participant) and in the TARGET 2 instant payment service TIPS by the end of 2021; - Developing cross-currency instant payments in the European Union, which will be ensured by the inclusion of currencies other than the euro in the TARGET 2 service for instant payments - TIPS, as was the case with the Swedish krona in 2020;  - Encouraging the establishment of links between payment systems processing instant payments in the European Union and those of third countries offering the same service, provided that the standards for fraud prevention, money laundering, etc. are met. 4. Further steps to digitise financial services in the EU  The further development of digitisation will continue to be among the main priorities, and the following measures are expected to be taken in order to accelerate these processes and reach their full potential at European level: 4.1. Eliminate the fragmentation of the digital single market by: - Legislative changes aimed at creating opportunities for interoperable use of digital identity throughout the European Union. This will allow easy ‘onboarding’ of new customers entirely online, in full compliance with the requirements for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing; - Facilitating cross-border provision of financial services, including by introduction of a harmonised regime for new activities such as crowdfunding, credit intermediation, and cryptocurrency services;  4.2. Adaptation of EU legislation to facilitate digital innovation: - Regulation of activities with cryptocurrencies and financial instruments based on tokens by introducing a comprehensive regulatory framework by 2024, allowing the implementation in the financial service sector of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and cryptocurrencies, taking into account the related risks; 
4  - Promoting cooperation and use of cloud computing infrastructure, including through the development of a legislative framework for the supervision of information and communication technology (ICT) providers for the financial sector; - Promoting the use of artificial intelligence tools in the financial services sector; - Adherence to the principle of technology neutrality of legislation, combined with the issuance of interpretative guidelines on how existing legislation on financial services should be applied to new technologies in order to reduce legal uncertainty.  - 4.3. Promoting innovation based on financial data by creating a common space for financial data - Facilitating digital access to legally required financial information disclosed by financial institutions through standardised and machine-readable formats;  - Promoting innovative computer technologies to facilitate reporting and supervision (so-called reg-tech and sup-tech);  - Encourage data sharing between companies in the financial services sector inside and outside the EU (‘open finance’). 4.4. Meeting the challenges and risks related to the implementation of digital technologies: - Keeping financial stability, protecting investors and consumers on the principle of ‘same business, same risks, same rules’, regulating the business of the big tech corporations involved in provision of financial services; - Protecting consumers and the public interest – adapting the rules of consumer protection and personal data protection to digital financial services, ensuring the effectiveness of and making the legislation on money laundering, financing of terrorism, and tax avoidance fit for the digital age; - Enhancing the digital operational resilience. 5. Legislative proposals As part of the Digital finance package, the European Commission published proposals for the development of three regulations:  5.1. Proposal for a Regulation on digital operational resilience for the financial sector6  The Regulation contains the following basic concepts: - introducing requirements for the management by financial entities of the ICT-related risks and for the reporting to the competent authorities of major ICT-related incidents and digital operational resilience testing; - sharing information on cyber threats and vulnerabilities; - prescribing measures for the sound management by financial entities of the risk related to ICT third-party service providers; - introducing requirements for the contractual arrangements between ICT third-party service providers and financial entities; - establishing an oversight framework for critical ICT third-party providers when providing services to financial entities. 5.2. Proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets7 The Regulation defines the notion ‘crypto-asset’8 and lists the main types of crypto-assets, distinguishing between three sub-categories of crypto-assets: - Asset-referenced tokens9. Such tokens may be offered to the public only by credit institutions authorised to operate in the EU or by entities which hold the authorisation referred                                                            6 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/BG/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0595  7 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/BG/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0593  8 ‘Crypto-asset’ means a digital representation of value or rights which may be transferred and stored electronically, using distributed ledger technology or similar technology; 
5  to in the Regulation. However, issuers should always draw up and publish a crypto-asset white paper – a special information document which must comply with mandatory content and form requirements. This Regulation imposes an obligation on issuers of asset-referenced tokens to constitute and maintain a reserve of assets backing those tokens at all times, including rules for the composition of the reserve assets, the management and allocation and investment of assets,  -  E-money tokens10. They may be issued only by authorised credit institutions or electronic money institutions, again after publishing a ‘white paper’ and in keeping with some business-specific requirements.  - ‘standard tokens’ do not fall under any of the above categories. The only requirement for these to be offered to the public is that the issuer must be established as a legal entity in the European Union and must have published a crypto-asset white paper. This Regulation defines a new group of financial institutions, different from issuers of tokens, which are called ‘crypto-asset service providers’. This new group of financial entities will be subject to authorisation, and, depending on the scope of their authorisation, these providers will be able to provide the following ancillary services: - the custody and administration of crypto-assets on behalf of third parties;  - the operation of a trading platform for crypto-assets;  - the exchange of crypto-assets for fiat currency that is legal tender;  - the exchange of crypto-assets for other crypto-assets;  - the execution of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties and placing of crypto-assets;  - the reception and transmission of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of third parties; - providing advice on crypto-assets.  If a crypto-asset service provider needs the execution of payment transactions, that crypto-asset service provider itself must have authorisation to provide payment services or it must use a third party authorised to provide payment services. The Regulation introduces stricter supervisory requirements, including direct supervision by the European Banking Authority, for the issuers of so-called ‘significant tokens’ – tokens the total value of which exceeds a certain threshold.  The Regulation puts in place rules and requirements to prevent market abuse involving crypto-assets, such as the obligation for disclosing inside information and conditions for delaying disclosure of inside information; prohibitions on insider dealing, on unlawful disclosure of inside information and on market manipulation.  5.3. Proposal for a Regulation on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology (DLT)11.  This Regulation puts in place requirements for multilateral trading facilities and securities settlement systems which use the distributed ledger technology (DLT) (‘market infrastructures based on DLT’) and have received specific permissions granting one or several exemptions from certain provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU12 and Regulation (EU) No                                                                                                                                                                                      9  ‘Asset-referenced token’ means a type of crypto-asset that purports to maintain a stable value by referring to the value of several fiat currencies that are legal tender, one or several commodities or one or several crypto-assets, or a combination of such assets. ‘Commodity’ means any goods of a fungible nature that are capable of being delivered, including metals and their ores and alloys, agricultural products, and energy such as electricity; 10 ‘Electronic money token’ or ‘e-money token’ means a type of crypto-asset the main purpose of which is to be used as a means of exchange and that purports to maintain a stable value by referring to the value of a fiat currency that is legal tender; 11 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/BG/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52020PC0594  12 Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU 
6  909/201413. Only an entity authorised under Directive 2014/65/EU or an entity authorised under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 as a central securities depository may apply for permission to establish a DLT market infrastructure. The Regulation provides that the new regime may only be applied to shares, the issuer of which has a market capitalisation or a tentative market capitalisation of less than EUR 200 million; or convertible bonds, covered bonds, corporate bonds, other public bonds and other bonds, with an issuance size of less than EUR 500 million. Sovereign bonds are explicitly excluded from the scope of this Regulation.                                                              13 Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on improving securities settlement in the European Union and on central securities depositories and amending Directives 98/26/EC and 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 236/2012  
Pablo Hernández de Cos: Audiovisual communication competitionon financial educationSpeech by Mr Pablo Hernández de Cos, Governor of the Bank of Spain and Chairman of theBasel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the General Council of Economists, 4 February2021.*   *   *Third Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, Vice-Chair of the CNMV, Chair of the General Council of Economists, ladies and gentlemen:Let me begin by thanking the General Economists Association for organising this event, whichmarks the conclusion of the Audiovisual Communication Competition on Financial Education. Letme congratulate, too, the winners, other finalists and participants for their effort, dedication andhigh-quality work.The competition, like most activities since the onset of the pandemic, has had to adapt to theextraordinary circumstances we are facing. Both organisers and contestants have shown highadaptability. The contestants have had to put all their creativity into a digital content. These circumstances also serve to emphasise how financial education can complement thedevelopment of other citizens’ capabilities, particularly those relating to digital skills.Clearly, this competition aside, we have all in the last few months purchased more goods andservices, including financial ones, through digital channels. This trend will likely continue in thefuture.To ensure citizens adapt appropriately to these developments, financial education efforts mustrun in tandem with digital education ones. Otherwise, pockets of financial exclusion (for instanceamong our elderly) could arise, or the risks deriving from uninformed financial purchases couldbe compounded by those resulting from the use of an unknown digital channel.The videos presented have adequately captured the importance of the concept of responsiblefinance. This was, indeed, the central slogan of the 2020 Financial Education Day. However, notonly have they captured the concept adequately, they have also been able to project it towardsone of its most important components: responsible consumption.In this regard, I would like to highlight that exercising this responsibility involves all players. First, customers (all of us), as many videos have accurately illustrated, must exerciseresponsible consumption. This requires us to assess our own available resources and borrowingcapacity. In short, the idea is to avoid excessive over-indebtedness, which we know generateshighly adverse effects that influence our life decisions over an extended period of time.Second, such responsible behaviour must be demanded of financial institutions, which shouldpractice what we call “responsible lending”. This entails properly assessing the creditworthinessof the potential customer before granting financing.Lastly, official authorities, and supervisors in particular, should promote this responsibility andmonitor compliance as a key element in ensuring the stability of the financial system. And norshould they rule out the possibility of taking action if deemed necessary.Here I would like to remind you that the Banco de España has opened a public consultationprocess on the amendment of Circular 2/2016 on supervision and solvency this very week. Theaim is to develop certain aspects of the macroprudential toolkit that legislation has made 1 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
available to the Banco de España.Pursuant to this legislation, the Banco de España may set limits and conditions on lendingstandards and other financial institution transactions, along with sectoral concentration limits.The new Circular defines the procedures for activating, deactivating and changing thesemeasures, including the variables and parameters that the Banco de España may take intoconsideration to adopt a decision, the sectors that may be affected and the contractual terms orratios that the measures may apply to. I would like to conclude by thanking the General Council of Economists for this initiative geared toyoung people, a group that the Banco de España considers a strategic priority in the context ofthe Financial Education Plan.It is a further example of how the Financial Education Plan partners, in this case the GeneralCouncil of Economists, play an essential role in meeting the Plan’s objectives. We have continued to move resolutely in this direction: through partnership agreements such asthose recently signed with the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training and the Ministry ofConsumer Affairs; and by pressing ahead with the work avenues opened with the Ministry ofEconomic Affairs and Digital Transformation.Once again, I would like to congratulate the winners, finalists and participants in this competitionand, naturally, the organisers. I encourage them to sustain their efforts to boost the expansion offinancial education.Thank you very much. 2 / 2BIS central bankers' speeches
Vitas Vasiliauskas: Investment and Investment Finance - LithuaniaWelcome speech by Mr Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania, atthe joint Bank of Lithuania and European Investment Bank Webinar on Investment andInvestment Finance, 11 February 2021.*   *   *Good morning, dear Marco, dear Thomas colleagues, presenters and viewers,A warm welcome to this joint webinar organised by the Bank of Lithuania and the EuropeanInvestment Bank (EIB). Allow me, first of all, to thank the EIB for approaching us with the idea tohold this event.This is indeed a pivotal time to talk about investment. Investment decisions that we make nowwill be crucial in both the short and the long run.Let us begin with the short-term implications. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), gross fixed capital formation in the euro area fell by almost11% last year. This is a stark contrast to the US, where this decrease did not amount to even2%. In 2021, investment in the US will remain stronger as well.Accordingly, GDP in the euro area is now projected to recover to the pre-pandemic level onlytowards the end of 2022. The US, meanwhile, is likely to make up for the lost ground already thisyear, whereas China’s output has not only fully bounced back – it has already returned to its pre-pandemic trend. Europe should not be satisfied with such outlook.The euro area needs a stronger investment push to speed up our recovery and catch up with theother large economies. Otherwise, painful long-term scarring effects will become unavoidable.Public investment is key in this regard – especially in the current low-rate environment,characterised by historically low sovereign debt servicing costs as a share of fiscal revenue.As for the private sector, various surveys and reports show that uncertainty now stands as thelargest barrier for private corporate investment. Our estimations show that even in Lithuania,despite its strong economic resilience displayed so far, private sector investment is likely to havefallen by almost 8% in 2020.However, policy makers can address this issue. Current research suggests that when firmsgrow risk-averse due to uncertainty clouding the future, public investment becomes much moreeffective than usual. Not only does it have a higher multiplier, but it actually crowds-in privateinvestment, rather than crowding it out. That is, of course, if it is high-quality public investmentwhich is well-targeted and can enhance the potential output.This is why a consistent and speedy implementation of the Next Generation EU package will beso important for Europe in the near-term horizon. At the heart of the package is the Recovery andResilience Facility (RRF). By supporting Member States’ reforms and public investment, theRRF will provide an anti-cyclical fiscal impulse in the immediate term – much needed acrossmany parts of Europe. And I do believe that, given the current circumstances, it can catalyseprivate sector investment.However, there is a risk that the European money will not be disbursed quickly enough becauseof administrative obstacles or because the RRF plans put forward by Member States may simplylack ambition. Lithuania has a good track record regarding the absorption rates of Europeanfunds – we currently rank ninth in terms of the 2014–2020 financial perspective. But we cannotgrow complacent.12 1 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
Lithuania should take full advantage of the RRF funding and put forward a high-quality plan for theCommission in April. By this, I mean a plan that is based on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis andis in line with the European priorities. The Bank of Lithuania stands ready to mobilise its expertcapacities to help ensure that the plan advances a serious investment and reform agenda.This leads me directly to the long-term perspective.According to the latest data, Lithuania’s GDP decreased by 1.3% in 2020, beating the previousforecasts made both by the Bank of Lithuania and international institutions. And this is despite theongoing second lockdown.In this light, the RRF is important to Lithuania not so much as an immediate relief measure, butas a tool for long-term economic transformation over the upcoming years and even decades.Indeed, we need to think strategically of the post-pandemic world. At least three major forces willbe shaping our future – shifts in supply chains, digitalisation and climate change. Our investmentstrategies will have to accommodate these trends.First, the pandemic has, at least partly, provided an impulse to reverse globalisation.Vulnerabilities related to global value chains have been exposed. Countries and regions havedeclared their intensions to repatriate the production of strategically important goods.It is crucial that Lithuania, which has not yet achieved full economic convergence with the EUaverage, uses these global shifts to its advantage. We need to attract foreign direct investmentthat could help us enhance our participation in the recalibrated value chains. We should focus onbringing in higher value-added activities, so that we could provide a strong impetus to the growthof labour productivity and, consequently, the potential output.Second, digitalisation has also been greatly accelerated by the pandemic. Restaurants andshops have digitalised their processes to offer delivery services. People have been workingremotely for extended periods of time.We therefore need to invest in digital infrastructure, including 5G networks, to fully adjust to thenew reality.Digitalisation will also bring more automation and artificial intelligence, thus providing a boost toproductivity. We should encourage this with our investment policies, including investment inhuman capital, so that the labour force can successfully participate in this brave new digitaleconomy.Here I see a connection with the third great force that will shape our future – climate change.Investment in green technology can not only help reduce CO2 emissions or bring about cheaperrenewable energy.Large-scale and ambitious green investment programmes can also help offset the negativeeffects of automation – the loss of jobs and growing regional inequalities.Again, the Next Generation EU can become a good anchor for green investment. At least 37% ofexpenditure in each national RRF plan must support climate objectives.However, green investment needs are even higher. Under the European Green Deal strategy, theEU is committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to1990 levels. It is estimated that the “green investment gap” – the additional investmentsnecessary to achieve this target – amounts up to €300 billion per year.Therefore, it is quite obvious that we will need to promote green investment on a national level aswell. 2 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches
One of the ways to do so is to provide more leeway for green investment in the European fiscalframework, the review of which is likely to resume in 2021. For instance, we could introduce a“green clause”, which would exclude growth-enhancing green investment from the overall deficittarget.This issue is as relevant to Lithuania as to any other Member State, since the EuropeanCommission considers us to be at risk of missing our 2030 climate targets.Fostering a financial system that is financing climate-friendly investment will also be anincreasingly important topic for central banks. Last year, the Bank of Lithuania joined the Networkfor Greening the Financial System (NGFS), aimed at scaling up green finance. Climate change,including related risks that are not correctly priced by the markets, will also be considered in theongoing European Central Bank’s (ECB) monetary policy strategy review.Dear colleagues,To conclude, investment today is as important as ever. First, it can help repair, i.e. restoregrowth in the short-to-medium term. And second, it is needed to prepare for the long game.I therefore look forward to the upcoming discussions and presentations, including on the latestEIB Investment Survey and its key findings for Lithuania.Thank you.Marco Francini, moderator, Head of Regional EIB Groups Office for the Baltic States, European Investment Bank.Thomas Östros, Vice-President of the EIB.12 3 / 3BIS central bankers' speeches

It is my pleasure to join you today at this Prelude event to ACI’sinaugural Asian Financial Markets Forum to be held in October. Asian economies andfinancial markets have experienced remarkable growth in the last two decades, and willcontinue to be major contributors to global growth going forward. With this positiveoutlook, I am glad that the Forum will focus on “The Asian Financial Markets in the NextDecade” – a theme which is highly important and invigorating.Macroeconomic outlook – Bullish for Asia2.      The COVID-19 global health crisis has led to the deepest economic downturn in eightdecades. The World Bank estimates that the global economy contracted by 4.3% in 2020. As the world economy began to emerge from the depths of recession in May last year, Asiawas at the forefront of the recovery.Indeed, the 2020 recession in Asia was shallower than in the rest of the world.  This wasdue both to positive growth in China and Vietnam, as well as less severe recessions inother Asian countries.China was the first country to enter lockdown and the first to record a V-shaped growthrebound.In other Asian countries, more eﬀective virus containment meant that domesticeconomic activity was less severely aﬀected than in other parts of the world.[1][2]
12/02/2021"Riding the Growth Momentum in Asia" – Keynote Speech by Ms Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director (Markets & Development), …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/riding-the-growth-momentum-in-asia2/11Quickly restoring production capacity played into Asia’s strong presence in global valuechains. Asian merchandise exports held up well, as global consumers spent more ongoods while access to services was restricted. Asian exports of medical supplies andelectronics expanded.3.      While large swathes of the world are gripped by renewed waves of COVID-19 infectionstoday, eﬀective vaccination programmes and unprecedented policy support are expected tosupport a strong recovery in the second half of 2021. The World Bank forecasts global growthat 4.0% this year; with growth in East Asia at 5.9%. ASEAN economies are expected to expandby 5.0% in 2021, also surpassing the performance of regions beyond Asia. 4.      There are however, still considerable uncertainties on the horizon. These include thecourse of the pandemic, progress on vaccination, the possibility of governments mistimingthe withdrawal of policy support, and the evolution of US-China trade and investmentrelations.5.      The pandemic is also likely to have lasting economic eﬀects beyond 2021, includingpostponed investments, the negative impact of sustained job losses on human capital,global supply chain reconfigurations that emphasise resilience over eﬀiciency, and highpublic and private debt levels. These eﬀects will further threaten potential growth ineconomies globally.6.      However, Asian economies are poised to overcome these challenges. Our growth modelwhich comprises deep international integration, investment in human capital, and soundeconomic governance has helped us weather past crises and will continue to serve us well.The digitalisation of the regional economy also oﬀers immense opportunities. It isfacilitating the growth of emerging industries such as e-commerce and expanding access tothe vast East Asian market for non-traded goods.7.      In the medium term, Asia’s outlook is positive. In the next five years, the IMF projects5.2% average annual growth for the region, compared to 3.2% for the rest of the world.  By2025, Asia’s share of global GDP is expected to reach 38%, up from 26% 20 years ago. Financial Markets in Asia – Sharing the growth story8.      Asian financial markets have grown in tandem with the Asian economic growthtrajectory.The region’s equity markets account for about 40% of global equity market capitalisation,doubling its share over the last 20 years; The growth of Asia’s bond markets has been phenomenal, with annual issuance volumerising 9-fold  in 20 years, and accounts for about a quarter of annual global bondissuance volumes today;[3][4][5][6]
12/02/2021"Riding the Growth Momentum in Asia" – Keynote Speech by Ms Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director (Markets & Development), …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/riding-the-growth-momentum-in-asia3/11Capital inflows to Asian equity and bond markets are expected to continue at a strongpace as the weightage of Asian securities in benchmark indexes rises further, reflectingAsia’s rising economic importance;Asian wealth is also expanding at a faster rate, with assets under management growing at10% compound annual growth rate in the past 5 years, outpacing the 5 – 6% growth inEurope and North America  ; and Based on the BIS’ FX and OTC derivatives survey in 2019, Asia is home to three out of fivetop FX centres by volume today. 9.      Singapore, as a key financial centre in Asia, plays a critical role in connecting globalmarkets and supporting Asia’s development.Asset managers in Singapore have facilitated a good portion of investment flows in Asia.In 2019, assets under management (AUM) in Singapore grew 16% to reach S$4.0trillion, with 76% of the AUM originating from outside of Singapore, and 69% of AUMbeing invested into the Asia Pacific region  .There has also been increased treasury and risk management activities carried out inSingapore to meet the needs of global investors and businesses in this time zone. Besidesincreasing fund flows, more regional and global MNCs have been setting up theircorporate treasury centres in Singapore to facilitate capital raising, cash managementand risk hedging, as their regional businesses grow.Singapore is a major derivatives trading hub in the region, with three derivativesexchanges oﬀering multi-asset class risk management products.We are also Asia Pacific’s largest FX centre, third largest globally, with average dailytrading volume reaching US$640 billion in 2019, as we intermediate flows betweenregional teams of buy-side and sell-side players in Singapore and beyond.10.      Looking ahead, Asian financial markets are expected to become even more vibrant asthe world economy’s centre of gravity shi s further towards Asia.  Market participants in theregion should embrace this opportunity to shape the future of Asian markets.  While thegrowth trajectory has been very encouraging, more work needs to be done to develop deepand liquid capital markets in Asia, so that they can play a key role in financing economicgrowth, alongside continued development in the banking segments. 11.      I will highlight a few additional areas of focus for Singapore:In foreign exchange, trading volume of Asian currencies, including that of Asian emergingmarkets currencies, has risen. To support this growth, we have been building an e-tradingecosystem in Singapore to support electronic trade execution and price discovery in FX[7][8][9]
12/02/2021"Riding the Growth Momentum in Asia" – Keynote Speech by Ms Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director (Markets & Development), …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/riding-the-growth-momentum-in-asia4/11during Asian trading hours, a move that will bring about better execution, lower cost oftrading, and greater transparency for market participants.Key global and regional sell-side and buy-side players, as well as e-tradingplatforms, have anchored their regional pricing and matching engines here, andhave seen early successes.Global liquidity providers that have completed the set-up of their pricing andtrading engines in Singapore provided feedback that trade-fill ratios have improved,from about 80% to near 100%. Notably, when FX market volatility reached multi-year highs in March last year amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the robust e-tradinginfrastructure in Singapore was able to tide regional market participants over thestorm, with relatively good execution. We seek to enhance Singapore’s value proposition as a full-service international fundmanagement and domiciliation hub.  The Variable Capital Companies (VCC) frameworkprovides fund managers with a wider suite of investment fund vehicles and potential costsavings from centralising fund management and domiciliation activities, whilst providingnew business opportunities for fund managers, service providers and fund advisors. TheVCC has seen strong industry adoption, with close to 200 VCCs set up in its first year, for adiverse range of traditional and alternative investment strategies.In the bond markets, Singapore’s strong ecosystem of buy-side and sell-side institutions,alongside professional service providers, provides a robust gateway for internationalcapital to be channelled to Asian borrowers. To strengthen our value proposition as Asia’sleading bond centre and building on the success of the Asian Bond Grant Scheme  , welaunched the Global-Asia Bond Grant Scheme  in 2020, which defrays issuance-relatedexpenses for companies with an Asian nexus. In particular, a new funding tier for jumbo-sized issuances was introduced, with a doubling of the maximum grant amount fromS$400,000 to S$800,000 per issuance for these issuances.In insurance, we aim to be a global capital for Asian risk transfer, oﬀering a wide spectrumof risk financing solutions that goes beyond traditional insurance and reinsurance, toalternative risk financing solutions such as insurance linked securities.Last but not least, we also seek to help Asia transit to a greener and more sustainablefuture, through the mainstreaming of sustainable financing.12.      In sum, Asia is riding a good growth momentum, with Asian financial marketsexpected to continue on a path of strong expansion. I will oﬀer some perspectives on trendsand opportunities, which I hope will complement your subsequent discussions at this Forumon the Asian outlook, and risks and opportunities in Asian financial markets.Key Trends and Opportunities[10][11]

Thisinnovation was enabled through MAS Sandbox Express. It allowed investors access tosecondary market and purchase bonds at fractions of US$1000 instead of typical bondtrades of at least US$200,000, making bonds more accessible to a wider investor pool.In September, the Singapore Exchange completed Project Hash, Asia’s first digitalsyndicated public corporate bond using smart contracts to capture the rights andobligations of parties involved in the issuance and asset servicing, such as the arrangers,depository agents, legal counsel and custodians. The pilot successfully reduced thesettlement duration of primary issuance from 5 days to 2 days. These are just some examples of the tremendous scope for innovation in Asian financialmarkets.15.      Job functions will need to adapt, and our workforce will need to be equipped withthe right capabilities and skills to capture the opportunities.In 2019, MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance (IBF) commissioned a detailedstudy  on the impact of automation and data analytics over the next 3-5 years on jobtasks and skills needs in the financial sector.  The study estimates that half of the jobroles in the financial sector in Singapore would be augmented as individuals leverage ondata analytics and automation to amplify their performance.  Another one third would be[12]

I am also pleased to hear that ACI has been an active supporter in workforceupskilling, through the courses it provides on relevant financial markets and productsupskilling courses for the industry.MAS and IBF are also actively driving the expansion and deepening of workforcecapabilities in technology and specialised fields, to meet the needs of the rapidlyevolving financial sector landscape in Asia.Beyond the technical skills, it is also important to have a deep understanding of themarkets we serve. This Forum is an important platform to have that exchange of insightswhich can enhance our understanding of the risks and opportunities in this region,allowing us to navigate the future better. We can also have a better steer if we ingrain theAsian acumen, which is o en built upon relevant work experiences in the region. Tosupport this objective, MAS has been grooming more Singaporeans to be leaders andspecialists, including giving them international exposure through the iPOST scheme,which supports overseas postings of Singaporeans to the region and beyond. MAS, IBF, and the financial industry will continue to work together to prepare our workforcewith the skills for the future by developing a strong talent pipeline to enter the sector, andreskilling and redeploying local professionals into functions where jobs are growing.Adapt and adjust for a sustainable future
12/02/2021"Riding the Growth Momentum in Asia" – Keynote Speech by Ms Jacqueline Loh, Deputy Managing Director (Markets & Development), …https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/speeches/2021/riding-the-growth-momentum-in-asia7/1117.      Second, there is increased expectation on the financial sector to play a greaterrole in enabling a more sustainable future. Global warming has led to more frequent andsevere natural disasters. Asia will be one of the hardest hit with its densely-populated low-lying coastal cities. Over the last two decades, 7 out of 10 of the countries that were mostaﬀected by climate risk events were in Asia  . 18.      The financial sector can support Asian economies in two ways - adapt to theinevitable, and adjust for the better. First, in face of climate change, we will need to adaptand protect our assets and people. We can do so by investing in climate-resilientinfrastructure and insuring against climate and disaster risks.Invest in climate-resilient infrastructure: Many parts of Asia are building out theinfrastructure, and we can take this chance to build for resilience. ADB estimates thatUS$3.1 trillion investments are required for climate-adjusted infrastructure in the regionby 2030. Today, the infrastructure asset class constitutes only a small portion of assetsunder management  . There is much headway for growth, amidst a pressing need tomobilise private capital to climate resilient infrastructure as an asset class to bridge thisfinancing gap.To that extent, Infrastructure Asia was set up in April 2018 to serve as a platform toconnect local and international stakeholders across the value chain for jointprojects to meet Asia’s growing infrastructure needs. I would encourage marketparticipants to leverage on Infrastructure Asia’s network, knowledge and expertise.Insure against climate and disaster risks:  Asia bears the brunt of economic lossesarising from natural disasters and climate change will amplify the impact. Yet, Asiaremains under-insured. Insured losses for natural catastrophes account for only 15% oftotal economic losses, compared to 34% globally for period 2010 – 2019  .  Singapore aims to help Asia close the protection gap by addressing data paucityissues with the Natural Catastrophe Data Analytics Exchange (NatCatDax) project,co-creating new risk solutions with regional governments and Industry such as theSoutheast Asia Disaster Risk and Insurance Facility (SEADRIF).In November 2020, we established the Global Asia Insurance Partnership (GAIP), atripartite partnership between industry, academia and policy makers. GAIP aims tobe the global centre of excellence in insurance and risk management with a focus onAsia. Climate risk and pandemic risk have been identified as the two initial focusareas of the GAIP.[13][14][15]

Global green bond issuance volume increased nearly50% to reach US$255b in 2019  , which is a six-fold increase from 2015. OECD expects it tohit US$5.6 trillion by 2035  . In Asia, green bond issuances are also rapidly catching up, andnow accounts for 24% of global green bond, a leap from the 5% market share 5 years ago. 20.      Singapore launched the Green Finance Action Plan in 2019 to support a sustainableSingapore, and facilitate Asia’s transition to a sustainable future.  We aim to:Strengthen our financial sector’s resilience to environmental risksDevelop green finance solutions and marketsHarness technology to facilitate sustainable financing flowsBuild knowledge and capabilities in sustainable finance21. Under the Green Finance Action Plan:Banks, insurers and asset managers are required to factor in environmental risks as partof their business and risk management decisions;Businesses can access grants to defray the incremental expenses of taking up green orsustainability-linked loans and bonds to support their investments in green projects andadoption of more sustainable business practices;We encourage Fintechs and financial institutions to develop green fintech solutions, andpartner MAS’ eﬀorts to leverage fintech to facilitate the mobilisation of capital,monitoring of commitments and measurement of impact to promote a green financialecosystem; andWe are building a deep pool of Asia-centric green finance expertise in Singapore,beginning with the establishment the Singapore Green Finance Centre, a collaborationbetween the Singapore Management University and UK’s Imperial College, to undertakegreen finance research, training and talent development programmes; we welcomecorporates and financial institutions to co-create research and benefit from the trainingprogrammes available.These are not exhaustive, and work is ongoing to broaden and deepen the green financeecosystem along the four key pillars.[16][17][18]

Concerns about greenwashing and the lack of clarity on what constitutes green or transition activities can impedefinancing flows to these activities. MAS is therefore working with the financial sector toassess the potential of a taxonomy for Singapore-based financial institutions, to facilitatethe financial sector to channel capital more eﬀectively to support Asia’s green and transitionneeds. We are also a member of the International Platform on Sustainable Finance, and willcontribute to global eﬀorts in establishing greater inter-operability between existingtaxonomies.  23.      I note that one of the three panels today will discuss sustainability issues. I believe thatthis will be the start of the many more useful sessions that the Asian Financial MarketsForum will put together, and this will provide us valuable insights as we continue to progresson the sustainability agenda.Conclusion24. To conclude, Asian financial markets are in good stead to support the positive growthmomentum in Asian economies in this new decade, and the building of a more sustainableworld.    25. I thank ACI for organising this event, providing us a front seat and a chance to contributeto the meaningful conversations on important issues to the region. 26. I wish you a fruitful discussion ahead.

Benjamin E Diokno: The BSP’s role in economic recovery andlessons in monetary policySpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at Kapihan sa Manila Bay, 5 January 2021.*   *   *Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) welcomes this opportunity to discuss its role incushioning the adverse impact of the COVID-19 crisis. We are indeed pleased to help theNational Government in steering the country towards a gradual and sustainable path to recovery.I will also share key lessons in monetary policy, which, I believe, will serve the country in goodstead moving forward.The shock from the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented.After exhibiting 84 consecutive quarters of growth, real GDP declined by 0.7 percent year-on-yearfor Q1 2020.By the second quarter of 2020, real GDP contracted by 16.9 percent. In Q3 2020, real GDP alsodeclined but at a slower rate of 11.5 percent. Year-to-date, real GDP growth is at –10.0 percent.The slower pace of GDP contraction is expected to continue in Q4 2020.Allow me to point out that crafting swift, timely and well-calibrated policy responses requires aclear understanding of the nature of the shock.What we are experiencing is a public health crisis. As such, the primary response ofpolicymakers should be towards containing the virus and providing adequate care for theinfected.The shock called for a bold and coordinated response from the National Government. To mitigateadverse effects of the pandemic, fiscal and monetary policy authorities must play distinct yetcomplementary roles.In particular, fiscal policy plays a crucial role as it can respond in a more targeted manner to themost affected sectors of the economy.Meanwhile, the role of monetary authorities has been to ensure the proper functioning of creditand financial markets, and that there is ample liquidity to support domestic demand.Given the abruptness and scale of the pandemic, the BSP deemed it necessary to provideadditional emergency support to the government’s broad-based health and fiscal programsrelated to COVID-19.  The BSP has deployed a wide range of monetary instruments and extraordinary liquidity-enhancing measures to support the economy. BSP reduced the policy rate by a cumulative 200basis points (bps). The cut in the policy rate is aimed at uplifting market confidence amidstronger headwinds owing to the pandemic.We also reduced the reserve requirement (RR) ratios by 200 basis points to calm the marketsand support bank lending to both retail and corporate sectors.In line with whole-of-government efforts, the BSP has extended provisional advances to the NGon a time-bound basis and within the limits prescribed by law. In March 2020, the BSP entered ashort-term repo agreement in the amount of ₱300 billion with the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr). 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
The arrangement was fully settled in end-September 2020. A fresh provisional advance of ₱540billion was again extended in October 2020 and was fully settled in 18 December 2020.Meanwhile, the BSP has also been purchasing government securities (GS) in the secondarymarket. This is part of BSP’s immediate monetary policy response to help shore up domesticliquidity, and restore market players’ confidence to continue participating in primary GS auctions.These measures have helped address temporary volatilities in the GS market, by maintainingmarket interests to continue to hold GS,  which in turn assisted the NG in meeting its fundingrequirements for its COVID-19- related programs.In total, the BSP’s policy and liquidity-easing measures has injected into the financial systemabout ₱2 trillion in liquidity, equivalent to about 10 percent of the country’s 2019 nominal GDPlevel.BSP also implemented a wide range of regulatory relief measures aimed at:    extending financial relief to borrowers of BSP-supervised financial institutions,    incentivizing bank lending;    promoting continued access to credit and financial services;    and supporting continued delivery of financial services.We have also allowed new loans to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to becounted towards banks’ compliance with reserve requirements. This is to encourage banks tocontinue lending to smaller businesses and critical large enterprises. This will also ensuresufficient domestic liquidity and credit in support of economic activity amid lockdown measures.MSME loans used as alternative compliance with reserve requirement (RR) reached 134.8 billionas of 26 November 2020 . This represented a 9.8 percent share of total RR while LargeEnterprises (LE) loans used as compliance reached ₱29.1 billion (or 2.1 percent of total RR).The BSP has also approved a limit on loans to MSMEs and large enterprises used as alternativecompliance at P300 billion and P425 billion, respectively.Supported by liquidity-enhancing measures of the BSP, latest data suggest that there is ampleliquidity in the financial system. Domestic liquidity expanded by 11.8 percent (y-o-y) to aboutP13.5 trillion in October 2020 from 12.2 percent  in September.Domestic liquidity dynamics and market function have improved as a result of the BSP’s liquidity-enhancing measures. The Monetary Board (MB) believes that keeping an accommodative stancehas been critical in ensuring favorable financing conditions to support economic activity andmarket sentiment.With adequate liquidity in the financial system, domestic interest rates have gradually declinedover the past several months.In line with its financial inclusion initiatives, the BSP also continued to push for the use of digitalfinancial platforms. This is consistent with our vision to shift from a cash-heavy to a cash-liteeconomy.  Under the Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap for 2020 to 2023, the BSP aims (1) tostrengthen customers’ preference for digital payments by converting 50 percent of the totalvolume of retail payments into digital form; and expand the proportion of financially included to 70percent of Filipino adults and (2) to encourage innovations which will boost real-time paymentsvelocity.We also supported digital payment initiatives such as the use of electronic fund transfers viaInstapay and PESONet, as well as the expansion of low-cost access points through cash agents 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
or third-party outlets. In the near term, we are set to pursue more of these digital paymentinitiatives.Allow me to underscore that implementing measures to address the impact of the pandemic hasprovided valuable lessons.First, the crisis experience has required central banks, including the BSP to be more agile. Thispandemic differs from other crises episodes in the sense that it has had a solid and fastinfluence on domestic and global demand.The COVID-19 crisis has also taught us that there are limits to what monetary policy can do.When interest rates are low and private demand are persistently weak, the transmission fromfinancing conditions to private spending might be reduced.Thus, it is crucial that monetary policy ensures favorable financing conditions for the wholeeconomy.This limitation to monetary policy highlights the critical role of the targeted fiscal policy responsesand underscores the need for a whole-of-government approach to combatting the pandemic.Meanwhile, persistent bank risk aversion and bleak loan demand continue to contribute to weakcredit activity. Preliminary data show that growth in outstanding loans of universal andcommercial banks, net of reverse repurchase (RRP) placements with the BSP, eased to 1.9percent in October from 2.6 percent (revised) in September. The overall slowdown in banklending growth points to muted business confidence and elevated uncertainty amid continueddisruptions in business operations. This phenomenon of weak credit activity amid the crisis issimilarly observed in other economies.Results of the Q3 2020 Senior Bank Loan Officers’ Survey (SLOS) show that the majority ofrespondent banks continued to report tighter overall credit standards in Q3 2020, although theyare fewer compared to Q2 2020, based on the modal approach. Based on the diffusion index (DIapproach), banks reported a net tightening of overall credit standards for both loans toenterprises and households in Q3 2020.Respondent banks attributed the tightening of credit standards largely to (1) less favorableeconomic outlook, (2) deterioration in the profitability of bank’s portfolio and profiles of borrowers,and (3) reduced tolerance for risk, among other factors.Nonetheless, improvements in mobility indicators indicate that firms and households arebeginning to adjust to the post-pandemic operating environment. This  could support resurgencein economic activity in the near term.In this slide, we show mobility changes as monitored by Google for the entire country. From thecharts, we can see that as of 29 December 2020, visits to places such as grocery andpharmacy and parks have approached their pre-COVID levels Visits to retail and recreation alsocontinues to show improvement. Meanwhile, mobility in transit stations is still flat given thattransport options have remained limited.For 2021, the economy is expected to bounce back, growing by 6.5 – 7.5 percent. This is basedon projections by the Development Budget Coordination Committee as of December 2020.Growth is expected driven by higher government spending and the passage of structural reformprograms such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises (CREATE) bill andthe Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer (FIST) bill.The BSP remains cognizant of economic developments and financial conditions, including thepotential impact of a prolonged COVID-19 health crisis. In view of this, BSP reaffirms its 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
commitment to complement government’s broader efforts to address the pandemic.BSP continues to have ample monetary policy space to deal with potential risks to liquidity andgrowth owing to the health crisis.We shall continue to provide support to the government while recognizing the crucial role ofsustained and targeted fiscal interventions in reviving demand.Moreover, let me assure you that when domestic developments warrant a recalibration orwithdrawal of policy support, the BSP will ensure a smooth normalization of its time-boundmeasures.The BSP shall continue to adhere to disciplined and evidenced-based policymaking. In the faceof this pandemic, we shall continue pursuing our mandate of promoting price and financialstability conducive to sustainable growth and employment.Thank you very much. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
Benjamin E Diokno: Philippines economic outlook - toward a solidrecoverySpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the 24th Membership Meeting of the Rotary Club of Manila, 6 January2021.*   *   *Mr. Robert Joseph, Jr., president of the Rotary Club of Manila (RCM); Mr. Herminio Esguerra,chairman of the program committee; the board of directors; officers, members and guests;ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.I have been invited today to talk about financial forecasts for 2021 amid the pandemic. But beforeI present the economic prospects over the near term, let us briefly step back and take a look atthe past year.First, I will go through recent economic developments and trends. Second, I will share someviews on the likely path of the economy, keeping in mind the highly uncertain environment we arein now. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to update the RCM members on the BSP’sinitiatives and advocacies.The year 2020 began with the Philippine economy in a position of strength.Real GDP growth had averaged at above 6 percent over a 10-year period, or a 6.4 percentaverage from 2010 to 2019. The robust growth of the domestic economy in recent years wasachieved in an environment of generally stable inflation and was anchored on purposefulstructural reforms.The country’s strong track record of prudent policymaking has likewise led to a robust externalpayments position, record-high international reserves, improved external debt metrics, andhealthy public finances.At the same time, Philippine banks continue to be sound, stable, and well-functioning based onall metrics.These robust fundamentals gave us the monetary and fiscal space to navigate the first fewmonths of this crisis.The COVID-19 pandemic had required the government to impose stringent lockdown measuresto save lives and help both the public health sector and LGUs respond effectively to the healthcrisis.Unfortunately, our economy, like many other economies around the world, suffered from thelockdowns. After exhibiting 84 consecutive quarters of growth, the Philippine economy contractedin the first three quarters of 2020, amounting to an average real GDP decline of 10 percent.We must note, however, that the COVID-19 pandemic has constrained economic activity notonly in the Philippines, but across the globe.Nevertheless, we are seeing early signs of recovery.The manufacturing purchasing managers index has risen to 49.9 in November, close to the 50-point expansion threshold. At the same time, the manufacturing volume of production index hasalso improved.The gradual easing of lockdown measures and promising developments regarding vaccines 1 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
have contributed to improvements in business operating conditions.Latest surveys indicate improved optimism of businesses and consumers, however.The overall business confidence index reverted to positive territory at 10.6 percent in Q4 from –5.3 percent in Q3.This optimism in the last quarter of 2020 was attributed to the reopening of businesses amid the“new normal,” easing of community quarantines nationwide, seasonal factors such as an uptickin demand during the holiday season and the start of the milling season, and the increase involume of sales and orders.Meanwhile, the overall consumer confidence index was more optimistic at –47.9 percent in Q4from –54.5 percent in Q3.The improved outlook during the current quarter was brought about by expectations of more jobsand permanent employment; additional and high income; effective government policies andprograms such as the Social Amelioration Program and the Plant, Plant, Plant Program; reducedcommunity restrictions, the reopening of businesses, and the expected end of the COVID-19pandemic when vaccines are made broadly available.Another cause of optimism are the results of the Google Mobility report, which provides insightson how people’s movements have changed throughout the pandemic.The report details how activities for retail, recreation and workplaces continued to improve for thePhilippines, suggesting a rise in economic activity.Notably, grocery and pharmacy figures were shown to come close to the baseline period,approaching pre-quarantine levels.Consequently, numbers under “residential” gradually declined to 18 percent as of December 7,2020—compared to their peak of 43 percent in April 2020—implying that people are staying lessat home.However, transit station activities remained subdued at –46 percent given the limited publictransportation options at present.  The unemployment rate moderated to 8.7 percent in October 2020 from a high of 17.7 percent inApril, during the strictest period of lockdown.The unemployment rate moderated to 8.7 percent in October 2020 from a high of 17.7 percent inApril, during the strictest period of lockdown.Price pressures remained manageable in 2020, with headline inflation averaging at 2.6 for theentire year. This is within the government inflation target of 2 to 4 percent.In December, inflation rose to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent in November, driven mainly byadverse weather-related disturbances and higher international oil prices.Meanwhile, the Philippine banking system has remained resilient and stable, with sufficientcapital buffers to withstand shocks.As of end-June 2020, the capital adequacy ratio of universal and commercial banks was at 16.3percent on a solo basis and 16.7 percent on a consolidated basis, well above the 10 percentregulatory requirement of the BSP and the international standard of 8 percent.Liquidity conditions remain ample, supported by the liquidity-enhancing measures of the BSP. 2 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Domestic liquidity continues to grow at a double-digit pace, rising by 11.8 percent to around₱13.5 trillion in October, albeit slightly slower than the 12.2-percent growth in September.Meanwhile, growth in outstanding loans of universal and commercial banks eased to 1.9 percentin October from 2.6 percent in September. The overall slowdown in bank lending growth reflectsthe combined effects of muted business confidence and the banks’ stricter loan standardsattributed mainly to continued disruptions in business operations.On a year-to-date basis, the Philippine Peso appreciated against the US dollar by 5.37 percent,to close at 48.06 pesos to the US dollar on December 28, 2020 from its end-December 2019closing rate of 50.64 pesos to the US dollar.  The peso has appreciated along with the Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, South Korean won,Japanese yen, Singaporean dollar, and Malaysian ringgit.Let us now turn to the macroeconomic prospects over the near term.The prevailing view is a “long, uneven, and uncertain ascent” toward global economic recovery.There remains considerable uncertainty if and how global trade and supply chains will evolve.The IMF, in October 2020, forecasted that world output would contract by 4.4 percent in 2020 andrevert to an expansion of 5.2 percent in 2021.Beyond 2021, world output is projected to decelerate to (growth of?) around 3.6 percent by 2024,indicating a delayed return to the growth trajectory before the pandemic.In any case, some recovery is already being seen as major economies open up further,supported by the optimism brought about by the gradual deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.On the domestic front, economic prospects are expected to improve as infrastructure and socialprograms, health capacities, and fiscal policies gain traction.While the real domestic GDP could contract by 8.5–9.5 percent in 2020 amid the communityquarantines, economic activity in the country is projected to recover and expand by 6.5–7.5percent in 2021 and by 8–10 percent in 2022, as global and domestic economies gradually re-open.Moreover, the DBCC, in consultation with the BSP, decided to retain the current inflation targetrange for 2021 to 2022 at 2 to 4 percent and retain the same inflation target band for 2023 to2024.Amid all the uncertainty, the national government’s inflation target remains an important anchorfor guiding the economy through the downturn and recovery stages.This inflation target serves as an important guidepost for the BSP. Monetary authorities couldcontinue to provide support to the economy after the health crisis through a resolute commitmentto deliver low and stable inflation.Latest forecasts indicate that inflation will remain within target in 2020 until 2022.BSP forecasts suggest that inflation could average at 2.6 percent for 2020, 3.2 percent for 2021,and 2.9 percent for 2022. The balance of risks to the inflation outlook also leans toward thedownside from 2020 to 2022, owing largely to potential disruptions to domestic and globaleconomic activity amid the ongoing pandemic.Similarly, inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored to the target range. 3 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
In response to the pandemic, the BSP has taken decisive policy measures to support domesticliquidity, bolster economic activity, and boost market confidence.The cumulative cut in the policy rate by 200 basis points was complemented by decisive liquidity-enhancing measures and regulatory relief to banks’ borrowers experiencing financial difficultyamid the lockdown.In an effort to assist the national government’s funding requirement for COVID-19-relatedprograms and consistent with its liquidity enhancing policies, the BSP has also boughtgovernment securities in the secondary market, provided short-term provisional advances, andremitted 20 billion pesos in advance dividends to the national government.In sum, the BSP has injected some Php2-trillion into the financial system, equivalent to 10percent of 2019 GDP.The BSP’s policy measures complement the government’s expansionary fiscal policy stance toboost demand and limit the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.The government’s accommodative fiscal policy aims to fund priority expenditures to help rebuildthe economy as well as invest in social services and infrastructure.Similarly, the recent approval of the 4.5-trillion peso General Appropriations Act for 2021, whichprioritizes health-related response programs and infrastructure projects, could help facilitate thestrong rebound of the economy and its transition to the “new normal.”In addition, let me stress that the BSP recognizes micro, small and medium enterprises as avital component of the Philippine economy. In fact, the BSP has approved a number of measuresto assist MSMEs during this crisis as well as hasten their recovery and ensure sustainability ofoperations in the post-crisis period.These measures include allowing banks to report MSME loans as part of their compliance withthe BSP’s reserve requirement.The BSP also implemented amendments to the regulatory capital treatment of exposures toMSMEs, which would free up capital and enable BSP’s supervised financial institutions to extendmore credit to the MSME sector.In particular, the BSP approved a temporary reduction in the credit risk weights of loans grantedto MSMEs that are current in status, and the assignment of lower risk weight for MSMEexposures that are covered by government guarantees.Overall, these measures are expected to channel liquidity to the MSME sector while ensuring thehealth and safety of the financial system.The BSP—as overseer of the payments system—likewise endeavors to provide an enablingenvironment for a safe, reliable, affordable, interoperable, and efficient retail payments system inthe country.In fact, even before the pandemic, we had advocated for the shift to a more cash-lite economythrough increased use of digital payment platforms under the National Retail Payment SystemFramework or NRPS.This has proven to be very useful, with physical distancing becoming the norm during thispandemic.In fact, a welcome development brought about by the new norm is the spike in PESONet andInstaPay transactions, the two automated clearing houses (ACHs) formed under National Retail 4 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Payment System Framework.In addition, the BSP’s issuance of the National QR Code Standard or QR PH has helped addressthe country’s fragmented QR-driven payment system. This new system can assist the economyin further leveraging on the efficiency, safety, and affordability of QR technology for payments.We have also supported the digitalization of payments to the government through EGov Pay, apayment channel that allows individuals and businesses to pay taxes, permits, fees, and otherobligations to the government through an electronic portal.Ladies and gentlemen, the past year has been turbulent and challenging. Our economy, and theeconomies of other countries across the globe, have been seriously hit by this unprecedentedhealth emergency.However, the Philippines’s robust macroeconomic fundamentals have helped us navigatethrough the crisis. And our fundamentals remain strong. Price pressures are manageable.Domestic liquidity remains ample. And the banking sector remains stable and resilient.There are also some early signs of recovery as we see some improvements in themanufacturing index, market sentiment, as well as mobility reports. As we learn to live with thevirus and adapt to the “new normal,” domestic economic activity is expected to rebound this yearwith inflation remaining well-anchored to the target range.For our part, we at the BSP have deployed timely and appropriate policy initiatives to supportdomestic liquidity and the country’s economic comeback.We will implement a prudent and data-driven disengagement from the BSP’s COVID-19 policyresponses, in support of the whole of government and the Filipino people on our way to a solidrecovery.Indeed, we are all aware that this path to recovery is tough. But this pandemic, as with otherchallenging periods in our history, has once again shown our resilience and fortitude as a nation.We will use this resilience to continue working hard in ensuring that our country will sustain astable recovery from the pandemic.I am certain that each of us gathered virtually in today’s meeting has a contribution to make in ourcollective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.Thank you and I wish everyone a safe and prosperous new year! 5 / 5BIS central bankers' speeches
Benjamin E Diokno: Philippine banking system - “Crossing thethreshold” for economic and financial recoverySpeech by Mr Benjamin E Diokno, Governor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP, the centralbank of the Philippines), at the 53rd Anniversary Financial Executives of the Philippines, 14January 2021.*   *   *FINEX President Atty. Francisco Ed. Lim, members and officers of FINEX, colleagues in thefinancial services industry and the Government, esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen, apleasant good afternoon to all.I wish to thank FINEX, our reliable partner in financial deepening and capital market development,for inviting me to be a part of your 53rd Anniversary celebration.Before I share with you the BSP’s initiatives towards economic and financial recovery in the NewEconomy, allow me to wish you all a Healthy and Prosperous New Year, as well as, tocongratulate both the outgoing and incoming officers of FINEX for leading the organization inthese trying times.We now find ourselves in what I call the “crossing the threshold” moment. In the world of mythsand movies, “crossing the threshold” occurs when the Hero leaves his or her ordinary world andenters a new, dangerous world. Your theme – Transcending New Frontier, Leading BeyondRecovery – speaks volumes of this “crossing the threshold” stage in the Hero’s journey arch.In the real world, we acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose threats toeconomies and financial systems around the world, including the Philippines.  The Philippine economy contracted by an average of 10.0 percent in the first three quarters of2020, following 21 years of uninterrupted growth.  However, said economic contraction was notreflective of the country’s strong fundamentals or prospects moving forward.  The BSP expects the recovery process to commence sooner as more industries re-openfollowing the gradual easing of restrictions throughout the country combined with stimulusmeasures rolled out by the government.On growth, we expect real gross domestic product to swing from a range of negative 7.0 tonegative 9.0 percent for the full-year 2020, to a range of positive 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year andan even faster growth in 2022.We anticipate interest rates to remain low, inflation to be manageable, the peso to be stable, andexternal accounts to be robust, with record-high gross international reserves.We expect inflation to remain manageable and within the 2.0 to 4.0 percent target range this yearand in 2022.  The strength of the Philippine Peso remains market-driven and supported by soundmacroeconomic fundamentals.The peso averaged P48.02/USD1 as of 4 January 2021, considered as one of the strongestcurrencies in the region. This is attributable to the country’s low inflation, a strong and resilientbanking system, low debt-to-GDP ratio, and a hefty gross international reserve.Overseas Filipino remittances are expected to rebound from a contraction of 1.0 percent in 2020to a growth of 4.0 percent this year. 1 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
On the external front, the overall external position will stay healthy. The balance of payments willpost a surplus of USD3.4 billion this year. The current account will remain in surplus, at USD3.1billion this year.Meanwhile, the country’s gross international reserves reached USD104.5 billion as of endNovember 2020.  At this level, the GIR remain more than adequate as it can cover 11 months’worth of imports of goods and payments of services and primary income. This is more than thethree months’ worth of imports cover requirement.While the full impact of the pandemic is still unfolding, the good news is that the Philippinebanking system is expected to withstand the impact of the pandemic. The financial system is in astrong position to both weather the significant economic effect caused by the COVID-19pandemic and support the country’s economic recovery.The domestic banking system is expected to remain relatively stable in the next two years.Majority of the Banking Sector Outlook Survey respondents projected that real gross domesticproduct growth will return to a range of less than 6.0 percent to 6.3 percent.Likewise, 69 percent of the respondent banks projected a stable Philippine banking system.Further, majority of the respondent banks projected growth between 10.0 percent and 15.0percent in their loan portfolio over the next two years.Banks also anticipate a more active participation in the money and capital markets in the nexttwo years as growth in financial assets (excluding loans) is projected to not exceed 10.0 percentby more than half of respondents.The remaining banks estimated a double-digit growth. A double-digit deposit growth is alsoexpected by most banks.Majority of the respondents expect the non-performing loan to exceed 3.0 percent in 2021 and2022, while the ratio of restructured loans to total loans is estimated to be at a range of morethan 3.0 percent to more than 5.0 percent by almost half of banks.The banks retained their upbeat expectations on returns as 71 percent of the respondents for thesecond semester of 2020 forecasted double-digit net income growth for the next two years.At the onset  of the pandemic, the banking system had significant capital and liquidity buffers builtup due to both regulatory requirements and several years of favorable banking conditions.Likewise, the result of our stress tests suggests that banks can continue to lend and prosperthrough a broad range of adverse scenarios.To assess the impact of the pandemic, the BSP rolled out a Comprehensive Baseline Survey inApril 2020 and intensified our off-site surveillance of all our supervised financial institutions. Theresults of these proved useful inputs for our Supervision Departments.As the financial sector supervisor, the BSP needs to strike a balance between enabling banks tolend to the production sectors, including the micro, small, and medium enterprises sector, onone hand, and ensuring the promotion of safe and sound practices to contain the risk exposuresof the industry on the other hand.  This is the rationale for the time-bound nature of the prudential measures introduced by the BSP.This approach provides the BSP with the opportunity to assess whether the relief measuresrequire further calibration, given the health of the banking industry.The BSP’s relief measures are classified into five (5) main objectives: 2 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
●    Extension of Financial Relief to Borrowers. The BSP supervised financial institutions weregiven regulatory relief to enable them to grant equivalent financial relief to their borrowers,including micro, small, and medium enterprises, in the form of more flexible and favorablelending terms.●    Incentivize Lending.  The BSP’s prudential measures aim to promote financing to micro,small, and medium enterprises and enable them to carry on with their business during theCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as hasten recovery and sustainability of their operations, during thepost-crisis period.●    Promotion of Continued Access to Financial Services. Policies were placed to ensureaccess to formal financing channels by retail clients, including micro, small, and mediumenterprises, during the crisis. The use of information technology in carrying out financialtransactions was highly encouraged during the enhanced community quarantine period.●    Support for Continued Financial Services Delivery. The BSP granted operational reliefmeasures to assist its supervised financial institutions in focusing their limited resources on thedelivery of financial services to financial consumers and support their subsequent recoveryefforts.●    Support for Sufficient Level of Domestic Liquidity and Economic Activity. Monetary policymeasures were also adopted to support domestic liquidity and extend cheaper financing toborrowers, including micro, small, and medium enterprises.Following these strong, time-bound, and timely measures, the crucial question pertains to howPhilippine banks have been holding up through the pandemic.Based on our recent assessment, our key findings suggest that:a. Core funding remains relatively strong following COVID-19 outbreak;b. Bank lending slightly rises;c. Loan quality slightly weakens as borrowers experience cash flow interruptions and sustainlosses due to the pandemic; We don’t, however, see this trend extending in the long-run.d. Financial assets grow but a slower rate as banks opted to reduce Treasury activities to beliquid;e. Net income declines as additional provisioning rises. However, this is likely to be offset bylower operating expenses and deferment of capital expenditures and non-essential expenses;andf. Liquidity and capital buffers remain intact.The banking system’s credit growth continued amidst the pandemic. The banking system’sgross total loan portfolio grew year-on-year by 1.2 percent to P10.6 trillion as of end-October2020.From the funding side, the banking system’s total deposits rose by 9.5 percent as of end-October 2020 to reach P14.4 trillion.There has been a surge in the use of digital platforms during the ongoing community quarantineperiod that started in mid-March 2020.The greater use of PESONet is evident with the remarkable rise in the volume and value ofpayments made through the same from November 2019 to November 2020.  Over this twelve- 3 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
month period, payments made through PESONet more than doubled with volume surging by349.0 percent year-on-year and value rising by 133.0 percent over the same period. Aside fromaiding businesses in mobilizing funds during the pandemic, the PESONet was also used forsocial transfers made through the Social Security System’s Small Business Wage Subsidy(SBWS) Program.  This shows that this facility is a viable and efficient means of distributingwelfare benefits to indigent citizens.Likewise, since its launch in April 2018, InstaPay exponentially grew, registering over 1.5 millionpercent increase in volume and over 700 thousand percent in value as of November 2020, withthe volume rising to 26.3 million from 1,740 transactions and the value growing to P144.4 billionfrom P19.1 billion. The performance of InstaPay for the pandemic year 2020 has also beenimpressive with a year-to-date growth rate of 446.0 percent in volume, from   4.8 million to 26.3million transactions, and 325.0 percent in value, from P34.0 billion to P144.4 billion as of end-November 2020.Based on the BSP Lending Rates Survey, quoted annualized bank lending rates of all the 46universal and commercial banks have been generally declining particularly the lower limit. This, inturn, makes loans relative to nominal gross domestic product to rise by October 2020.Based on the Baseline Survey, the banking system may grow by 3.6 percent by end-December2020.  This expected growth, however, represents the top 20 banks across universal andcommercial banks, thrift banks, and rural and cooperative banks.As the Philippine banking system continues to support our micro, small, and medium enterprisesduring these difficult times, we expect loans to this sector to rise further.In particular, the banking system’s new micro, small, and medium enterprise loans used forcompliance with the reserve requirements have averaged P143.8 billion as of the reserve weekof 17 December 2020.Bank loan quality remained satisfactory amid continued loan growth. The non-performing loanratio was manageable at 3.7 percent as of end-October 2020, although higher than the 2.2percent ratio as of end-October 2019.Loan loss reserves have been generally increasing since the start of last year but inched downas of end-October 2020, resulting to a lower non-performing loan coverage ratio of 89 percent.We expect the banking industry to recalibrate provisions as banks continue to reassess thequality of their respective loan portfolios.The year-on-year growth of financial assets (aside from loans) moved from 15.2 percent inOctober 2019 to 9.4 percent in December 2019, and up again to 12.0 percent in October 2020 asbanks pegged their Treasury activities on liquidity positions.Based on the survey, the BSP supervised financial institutions will maintain their strategy as theduration of their investments was reduced to maximize portfolio returns. The top universal andcommercial banks did not introduce major changes in the composition of their portfolios as theyassess liquidity risk. Exposures are mostly concentrated in highly-liquid and investment gradeinstruments.As a natural consequence, profitability slides.Banking operations were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as the (annualized) net profit of thebanking system shrank by 15.8 percent year-on-year for the semester-ended September 2020.We however expect that other operating expenses will likely be reduced due to lower businessvolume and capital expenditures and non-essential expenses will be deferred. 4 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
Based on the BSP supervised financial institutions’ survey, the full year target for net interestincome, other fees, operating expenses will drop while provisioning will increase.To mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic on profitability, banks plan to impose cost-cuttingmeasures (e.g. deferred capital spending and freeze hiring of non-critical positions), intensifyloan collection activities, be stringent in loan monitoring, exercise prudence in loan releases,reduce cost of funds and boost marketing campaigns for new loans and deposits.The universal and commercial banks also intend to reduce their exposures to vulnerable sectorsand to increase ancillary or fee-based business while thrift banks, and rural and cooperativebanks want to fast track digitization initiatives to reduce operating expenses.Moving on, banks remain well-capitalized. The capital adequacy ratio of the universal andcommercial bank industry hovers at 15–16%, well-above the minimum thresholds set by theBSP at 10.0 percent and the Bank for International Settlements at 8.0 percent.Meanwhile, the banking system maintained sufficient buffers to meet liquidity and fundingrequirements.Moving forward, the BSP will prioritize the following supervisory areas to ensure the soundness,stability, resilience and inclusivity of the banking system amid the ongoing health crisis. This slideshows the key supervisory areas that we are looking into –●    Involvement of the Board and Management;●    Asset quality;●    Liquidity;●    Profitability;●    Capital adequacy; and●    Banking operations.We also fully support the two major legislations.●    The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer (FIST) bill is expected to assist the financialsystem in performing its role of efficiently mobilizing savings and investments for the country’seconomic recovery by disposing bad loans. This bill has been approved by Congress and is nowpending with the Office of the President.●    The Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises forEconomic Recovery (GUIDE) Bill aims to strengthen the capacity of government financialinstitutions – Philippine Guarantee Corporation, Land Bank of the Philippines, and theDevelopment Bank of the Philippines — to provide the needed assistance to micro, small andmedium enterprises and other strategically important companies.We will also continue to push for three major reforms.  First, pertains to Islamic banking. With thepassage of Republic Act 11439, the BSP is clothed with clear authority to issue broader set ofrules and regulations on Islamic banking.  Second, the BSP is committed to promote sustainable growth by fostering environmentallyresponsible and sustainable policies and work practices.  Likewise, “leading by example” is one of the best ways to usher the transition towards theadoption of sustainability principles in their corporate governance, risk management systems, 5 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches
strategic objectives and operations.  These are embedded in the recently-issued SustainableFinance Framework.Several pockets of green initiatives have been launched prior to the formalization of theSustainable Central Banking Program.These include, among others, the participation in the Green Bond Fund launched by the Bank forInternational Settlements as part of sustainable investing in reserve management. The BSP alsoimplemented the Monetary Board Paperlite Facility that resulted in the significant reduction ofpaper usage during Monetary Board meetings, and installed energy-efficient mechanisms suchas solar panels and inverter technology in air-conditioning systems.The BSP is a member of the Network for Greening the Financial System, a group of centralbanks and supervisors organized to enhance the role of the financial sector in managing climateand other environment-related risks and mobilize capital to support the transition towards asustainable economy.This Network for Greening the Financial System membership will strengthen BSP’s collaborationwith counterpart regulators in building awareness and contributing to the effective managementand mitigation of the impact of climate and other environment-related risks in the financial sector.Moreover, we have a lot to share with respect to the country’s experience in coping withcalamities and natural disasters. Late last year’s experience with Typhoon Ulysses reminds us ofthe need to act fast in order to address climate change. Destructive typhoons are becoming thenorm, and more  destructive ones may come in the future.  We have to be critical of our actionsand decisions today as they shape the future of this country.Finally, the Digital Payments Transformation Roadmap. You may have noticed the big shifttowards the use of digital payments which started during the enhanced community quarantineand is expected to continue under the “New Economy” environment.The BSP has designed a three-year digital payments transformation roadmap with twin goals by2023. The first goal is to drive the share of digital payments to at least 50.0 percent of total retailtransactions by offering faster, more affordable, and secure payment options that provide greaterconvenience.The second goal is to expand financial inclusion to cover at least 70.0 percent of adult Filipinosby onboarding them to the formal financial system through the use of payment or transactionaccounts.  In closing, allow me to reiterate some key points:●    The banking system is in a strong financial condition going into the crisis. It remains resilientamid the pandemic.●    Supervisory priority areas moving forward include monitoring of asset quality, decliningprofitability, liquidity and capital positions.●    Financial sector reforms will be important in economic recovery such Islamic Banking,Sustainable Finance, and Digital Transformation as well as the legislations on FinancialInstitutions Strategic Transfer and Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives toDistressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery.  ●    Lastly, and most importantly, despite the legacy risks and challenges of the current healthcrisis on the domestic financial system, the Philippine banking system is poised to remain stable,sound, resilient and inclusive in years to come. 6 / 7BIS central bankers' speeches

Andrew Bailey: The case for an open financial systemSpeech by Mr Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Financial and ProfessionalServices Address, Mansion House, London, 10 February 2021.*   *   *As we look forward – and for so many reasons we must look forward – it is important to focus onthe future of financial services, and the important role they play in our economy andinternationally. This will be my focus today.I am going to look forward with the benefit of history and context and set out why open financialmarkets are in the interests of all – home and abroad – and something we should always strivefor. I want to start with the Bretton Woods agreement towards the end of the Second World War.This was a fundamental and decisive commitment to an open world economy. This commitmentdid not come free at the time – the adjustment was hard for this country – and of course themore formal Bretton Woods system broke down in the 1970s. But that breakdown did notcompromise the commitment shared broadly across nations to an open world economy. Therehave been times when the commitment has been sorely tested, but it has not been abandoned.What followed the breakdown was a shift of emphasis, not a free for all. The shift was towardsmanaging the consequences of greater openness with much more emphasis on the stability ofthe financial system and its ability otherwise to do harm, both domestically and internationally.What was needed was not just openness, but safe openness. This emphasis was never moreevident than during and after the global financial crisis. There was a moment at the height of thefinancial crisis when it might have been natural to consider forfeiting the commitment to an openfinancial system in the face of damaging international linkages. That did not happen to our greatrelief – the G20 nations stood firm to the principles of Bretton Woods and committed tosignificantly reforming the international financial system and its regulation, by raising globalstandards for regulating the system and reinforcing the institutional structure.The Covid crisis has been the first big test of those reforms – and it has been a big test. Thescorecard to date is encouraging – by no means perfect, but the core of the system has stoodup well, which is needless to say a huge relief.In order to preserve this public good of an open world economy and now also an open financialsystem, has required a commitment to institution building both internationally and domestically.Bretton Woods created the IMF and World Bank, and slightly less directly the GATT and thenWTO. Out of the financial crisis came the importance of the global Financial Stability Board witha mandate to promote international financial stability underpinned by strong regulation,supervisory and other financial sector policies, reinforcing thereby the importance of G20 nations.The FSB works closely with, and is supported by, the four standard setting bodies of theinternational financial system – the Basel Committee for banks, IOSCO for markets, the IAIS forinsurance, and the CPMI for payment and markets infrastructure. And, just to underline theimportance we see in these bodies, it is with pride that I can say that the Bank of England chairstwo of the four – Jon Cunliffe for CPMI and Victoria Saporta for IAIS.These bodies are where the critical standards for governing the financial system get hammeredout, where safe openness is put into practice. They are very clearly global in reach, necessarilyso. They are not regional, they are global. We cannot participate in these bodies, and they cannotfunction as they do, unless we are all prepared to enter into the process and listen to and acceptideas from others. It requires us to give up some control over our standards and rules, becausethe alternative of a narrow domestic control is illusory – it would jeopardise achieving the verythings we want, safe open markets, and likewise open economies. Above all, these bodiesenable us to build the trust that enable our financial systems to stay open. 1 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
But, we do not for a moment believe that we can maintain the arrangements we have withoutchange. As the world around us changes, so too do we have to adapt how we achieve thesepublic goods. Also, we do not participate in these global institutions with the intention to waterthem down, misguidedly because we think this would preserve some notion of ourcompetitiveness as a nation. The UK could not be a global financial centre for long if we did.Let me reiterate again, the public goods of open economies, an open financial system and thestability of that system are global, not regional, in nature. The UK is one of the world’s largestglobal financial centres, and its financial stability – as the IMF have reminded us – is therefore aglobal public good. We are deeply committed to financial stability and given that the success ofour financial centre. That is not because we are mercantilist in our outlook. As the City’s longhistory shows, that has never been the outlook of people in the City; rather it has been to tradefreely and compete and grow new markets, to face outwards. We see that today for instance inthe embrace of fintech.The UK’s financial markets and its financial system are therefore open for trade to all who willabide by our laws and act consistent with our public policy objectives. The question then arisesof what sorts of safeguards and rules should apply to that trade?I mentioned earlier that one of the offspring of Bretton Woods was the GATT, subsequently theWTO. The focus of activity was for some considerable time on trade in goods not trade inservices. Both goods and services trade depend on robust standards and the regulation of thosestandards, but trade in services is almost entirely about such standards. This trade has beensubstantially supported by the global standards to which I referred earlier, and which has allowedcountries to defer to each other in terms of the prevailing rules and regulations.This means deferring to the rules of others to protect our citizens or firms when they choose todo business there. There is no doubt in my mind that the work done on global standards sincethe financial crisis has made this process easier to support and safer and improved the level oftrust we have in each other.The European Union has pursued the approach of so-called equivalence, which on the face of itallows for deferring to other authorities where appropriate. The EU’s framework of equivalence infinancial services is a patchwork across many different pieces of financial services legislation,taking different forms in different sub-sectors, and in some not present at all. Nor do theequivalence measures prescribe how the judgement should be made.As is well known, the post-Brexit equivalence process between the UK and EU has not beenstraightforward. It is, of course, two distinct processes – one for the UK to recognise the EU asequivalent to the UK, and one for vice versa. The UK has granted equivalence to the EU in someareas, but the EU has not done likewise to the UK. In a few areas – involving central clearing andsettlement – there has been agreement by the EU to extend temporary equivalence to the UK,recognising, I think, the clear risks to financial stability that would have arisen had this not beendone at the outset.It would be reasonable to think that a common framework of global standards combined with thecommon basis of the rules – since the UK transposed EU rules from the outset – would beenough to base equivalence on global standards. Less than this was enough when Canada, theUS, Australia, Hong Kong and Brazil were all deemed equivalent. Continuing with the example ofcentral clearing, the EU has recently made the US SEC equivalent for CCPs, subject to certainconditions. These conditions are already met by UK CCPs as they are a legal requirement in theonshored legislation, but equivalence beyond the temporary extension remains uncertain.The EU has argued it must better understand how the UK intends to amend or alter the rulesgoing forwards. This is a standard that the EU holds no other country to and would, I suspect, notagree to be held to itself. It is hard to see beyond one of two ways of interpreting this statement, 2 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
neither of which stands up to much scrutiny.The first interpretation is that the rules should not change in the future, and to do so would beunwelcome. This is unrealistic, dangerous and inconsistent with practice. As the world around uschanges, so must the rules to accommodate these changes. As evidence of this, look at whatthe authorities have had to do in response to Covid and the shock that created for financialmarkets. The EU is almost constantly revising, or contemplating revising its own rules, and that’sa good thing. So, I dismiss this argument.The second argument is that UK rules should not change independently of those in the EU. I ambeing careful to phrase this point. It’s not that UK rules might change independently – theequivalence process provides for re-assessment of such decisions, so this should not be aproblem. So, it must be the stronger form that they should not change independently. But that isrule-taking pure and simple. It is not acceptable when UK rules govern a system 10 times thesize of the UK GDP and is not the test up to now to assess equivalence.It’s worth considering why we would choose to change the rules. First, it would be rare to say theleast if such rules turn out always to work perfectly first time and thus need no amendment. Asan example of this, the EU itself is looking to amend MiFID2 to iron out areas that need furtherwork.Second, as the world moves on, so the rules need to adapt. If they do not, we will be heading fortrouble. The key point here is that good practice means that authorities should be transparent atthe time in explaining rule changes, and those changes should be consistent with internationalstandards where appropriate.Let me give three examples of areas of rule changes we in the UK are looking at, two involvingbanks and one life insurance. First, the Basel regime for banks has, from the outset in the 1980s,applied to so-called “internationally active banks”. The EU has chosen to apply it to all banks andrelevant deposit takers. That was a matter of choice. But the Basel regime is heavy duty andcomplicated when applied to small banks (I know many big banks will say the same, but sorrythat’s life). So, we want to see if we can apply a strong but simple framework of rules for smallbanks that are not internationally active. This is a sensible step in my view and not out of line withthe principles and practice of equivalence. Indeed, there are other countries, such as the US andSwitzerland that have regimes for small banks and have been determined equivalent to the EU inmany areas.Second, the EU changes its rules in December to allow software assets to count as bankcapital. The Basel Standards do not include intangible assets in bank capital, which wouldinclude software assets in the UK. We have not identified any evidence to support the notion thatsoftware assets have value in stress. On that basis, including them in bank capital would give afalse picture of a bank’s loss absorbing capacity. We are therefore intending to consult on plansto amend this on-shored EU rule in order to maintain the previous requirements of excludingsoftware assets from bank capital. This is in line with global standards and will enhance thesafety and soundness of UK firms.The insurance case rests on a different argument. Solvency 2 is an allembracing rulebookcovering both general/nonlife and life insurance. In practice, it probably works better for the nonlife world, because the risks and activities are more common across different national markets.Nonlife insurance is a broad and diverse sector, but each GI product occurs in different nationalmarkets in a more similar form. But, I have never been convinced that the EU had a commonalityof forms of life insurance across its national markets. They are in some cases at least quitedistinct markets and products. Certainly that is the case in the UK, where annuity business is aquite specific activity.Some specific elements of Solvency 2 have not proved to work for that market as well as hoped, 3 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches
so it is right that we should review it. There may also be reason to make changes that span bothlife and nonlife, but that is not the point I want to emphasise here.Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low regulation, high risk,anything goes financial centre and system. We have an overwhelming body of evidence thatsuch an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else’s. That said, I believe wehave a very bright future competing in global financial markets underpinned by strong andeffective common global regulatory standards.I want to finish with one further important area, that is, how the rules are applied – supervision aswe call it – and how we can be sure that this application of rules is effective across borders, andparticularly between the UK and the EU. It is of course critical that rules are applied effectively,and that there is co-operation between the authorities in different countries.With this in mind, we already have 36 MoUs agreed between the Bank of England / PRA andsupervisors across Europe. They ensure supervisory co-operation will be deeply engrained in therelationship. And let me welcome the content of the joint declaration on financial services thatwas contained in the UK-EU trade agreement. It provides for structural regulatory co-operation onfinancial services, with the aim of establishing a durable and stable relationship betweenautonomous jurisdictions based on a shared comment to preserve financial stability, marketintegrity and the protection of investors and consumers.This co-operation will be supported by a Memorandum of Understanding to be agreed by March,and this will enable discussions on how to move forwards on equivalence determinations“without prejudice to the unilateral and autonomous decision-making process of each side”.To conclude, there is no doubt in my mind that an open world economy supported by an openfinancial system that respects the public interest objective of financial stability will bring thegreatest benefits all round. It needs to be supported by effective institutions and stronginternational standards. But this must be a global, not a regional, regime to be effective. And thatis why we spend so much time and effort on the work of the global standard setting and oversightbodies. What follows from that is much more a matter of implementation and how we each putthese standards into practice consistently.We have an opportunity to move forward and rebuild our economies, post Covid, supported byour financial systems. Now is not the time to have a regional argument.Thank you. 4 / 4BIS central bankers' speeches

The impact of a digitaleuro on the financial systemSpeech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at a Bruegel online seminarFrankfurt am Main, 10 February 2021Throughout history, innovations in money have challenged and altered the structure of the financialsystem. Time and time again, innovations have given rise to debates about the risks they pose and therewards they bring, as well as the role of central banks in building confidence in money.Paper banknotes are a case in point. As they were easy to carry, they made commerce morestraightforward. But their success did not come easily. Attempts by central banks to issue banknotes in the17th century resulted in too many being issued and even defaults, raising questions about their effects onstability and, ultimately, on the credibility of the sovereign. Yet modern banknotes eventually enhanced thebenefits of central banking for society at large.[]Similar debates emerged with the rise of bank deposits in the 19th century. Advances in recording andcommunication technologies helped deposits become popular, consolidating the role of banks in moneycreation. But this also raised awareness that confidence in money depends on the stability of bankdeposits, leading central banks to take on the role of lender of last resort.In today’s discussion on the digitalisation of payments, these debates sound familiar. Some fear thatdigitalisation, if not properly governed, could crowd out cash over time, create instability and even threaten1

Central banks are therefore considering whether they should innovate themselves,by offering sovereign money in digital form to the public at large.At the ECB we are considering whether to issue – alongside euro banknotes – a digital euro: a digital formof money that, just like cash and unlike other means of payment, would be a claim on the central bankinstead of a claim on a private intermediary.But we must fully understand the economic, financial and societal implications of issuing a digital euro: weshould consider how we can achieve the benefits while preserving the stability of the financial system andmeeting the needs of Europeans.Today, I will discuss the main effects a digital euro could have on banking intermediation, financial stabilityand the international financial system. And I will consider some key design options that could address therisks involved.Benefits in the context of the digitalisation of financial servicesThe increased use of the internet, supported by rapidly growing computing power, has affected the entireeconomy. In the field of payments and financial services, the past decade has seen a rising number ofproviders and innovative technologies and products.[]At the same time, we have seen a profound shift in payment preferences, with the use of cash in retailpayments declining.[] Even before the pandemic, one in two Europeans said they would prefer to paydigitally in a shop.[] The pandemic has accelerated this trend.[] This is the first reason why we areworking on a digital euro: combining the safety of central bank money and the convenience of a digitalmeans of payment in order to satisfy consumer preferences.2345

The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html3/14Another reason is that while digitalisation generates greater efficiency and lower costs, it may also poserisks for consumers and the financial sector.The global tech giants – or big techs – are setting the pace of change in the provision of financial servicesin various ways. They are seeking to sidestep traditional distribution networks – including paymentsystems – through their control of social media, online marketplaces and mobile technologies.[] Thiscould lead to the rapid and large-scale take-up of the financial services offered by big techs, bothdomestically and across borders.[] Big techs are also seeking to expand the reach and improve thequality of financial intermediation through the large-scale processing of proprietary consumer datagenerated by their core activities.[] They could use such data to reduce the information asymmetry thatlies at the heart of financial intermediation.[]Data-driven models could jeopardise privacy and pose the risk of personal information being misused.Moreover, integration with other services provided by big tech companies may threaten competitionthrough tying, bundling, cross-subsidisation and winner-takes-all dynamics.[] This could crowd outtraditional intermediaries and reduce competition in financial markets, limiting consumer choice. In Europe,the expansion of big tech companies could make us dependent on technologies governed elsewhere.[]Finally, big techs may contribute to a rapid take-up of stablecoins both domestically and across borders,which could create systemic risks and even endanger monetary sovereignty.[]A potential answer to these trends – higher demand for digital payments and a possible dominant role oflarge, foreign service providers – is for central banks themselves to go digital in order to preserve moneyas a public good.[]A digital euro would aim to support digitalisation while continuing to give people choice in how they payand ensuring their payments remain competitive and secure. It would be designed to be safe, costless,678910111213

The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html4/14easily accessible and simple to use, thereby supporting financial inclusion. It would have the protection ofprivacy as a key priority, thereby helping to maintain trust in payments. We have in fact already analysedprivacy-enhancing techniques, and we will continue to do so in the coming months.[]A digital euro would be available to households, firms, merchants and financial intermediaries forpayments across the euro area, thereby helping to unify the European market. And it would increaseconsumer choice, reduce transaction costs and support the digitalisation of the economy, while makingsure that central bank money remains at the core of the financial system, underpinning stability.Our objective would be to make a digital euro interoperable with private payment solutions, so that it couldbe accessed through them. It would thus level the playing field by making it possible for all marketparticipants – bank and non-bank intermediaries and fintechs – to offer, at a lower cost, products that allowpeople to pay instantly.A digital euro could also act as a catalyst at the international level. By ensuring interoperability with foreigndigital currencies, including other central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), it could create much neededefficiency gains in cross-border payments[], lowering their costs.Potential unwarranted effects on the financial systemIn the broader debate and in some responses to our public consultation[], a number of concerns havebeen raised about the potential impact of a digital euro on the financial system.Paradoxically, a digital euro may prove too successful.[] If it is not properly designed, its main strengths– safety and liquidity – could affect monetary and financial stability on three fronts: first, financial14151617
10/02/2021Evolution or revolution? The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html5/14intermediation and capital allocation in normal times; second, financial stability in times of crisis; and third,the functioning of the international financial system. Let me consider each of these in turn.Effects on financial intermediation and capital allocation in normaltimesA digital euro could affect financial intermediation in several ways. It could attract payments activity frombanks and reduce their payments-related income and customer information. It could also attract deposits,especially if it were offered without limits on individual holdings and at such attractive conditions that thepublic moved large amounts of deposits from commercial banks to central banks.The concern is that this could lead to less stable and more costly funding, lower bank profitability and,ultimately, lower lending, constraining the financing of the real economy. I would make two points here.First, the risk of bank disintermediation depends on the design features of a digital euro. We can andshould design it in ways that prevent this risk. I will come back to this crucial issue in more detail.Second, the ECB does not plan to interact directly with potentially hundreds of millions of users of a digitaleuro. We simply would not have the capacity or the resources to do so. Financial intermediaries – inparticular banks – would provide the front-end services, as they do today for cash-related operations. Wewould provide safe money, while financial intermediaries would continue to offer additional services tousers.Furthermore, beyond such design adaptations, economic thinking on the possible impact of a digital euroon financial intermediation is not clear cut. In fact, recent analyses emphasise that we should look at thebroader economic implications of adopting a CBDC.
10/02/2021Evolution or revolution? The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html6/14One consideration is that introducing a CBDC is by itself neutral in terms of the allocation of capital in theeconomy.[] In fact, a shift from bank deposits into CBDC would merely change the composition ofbanks’ funding sources, with fewer private sector deposits and more central bank funding.[]Another consideration is that a digital euro could improve the allocation of capital by facilitating access topayments and reducing transaction costs, thereby helping to unlock business opportunities.[] It couldalso enhance competition in banks’ funding markets. To the extent that funding markets are not perfectlycompetitive, a central bank digital currency could reduce the market power of commercial banks andimprove contractual terms for customers, with little effect on the volume of outstanding deposits and loans.[]Potential effects in times of crisisThe risks to financial intermediation of issuing a digital euro are potentially more pronounced in times ofcrisis. This is the second way in which a digital euro could affect the financial system.A digital euro would give access to a safe liquid asset which – unlike cash and in the absence of design-related constraints – could potentially be held in large volumes and at no cost. Indeed, if not properlydesigned, in times of crisis a digital euro could accelerate “digital runs” away from commercial bankstowards the central bank. This risk could even be self-fulfilling, leading savers to reduce their bankdeposits and amplifying volatility in normal times too.[]For this risk to materialise, a number of lines of defence – such as deposit insurance, supervision and thelender of last resort – would have to fail or be perceived to be insufficient in the light of how easy it wouldbe to convert deposits into safe central bank money. Moreover, a digital euro could provide additional tools1819202122
10/02/2021Evolution or revolution? The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html7/14to counter such risks to financial stability. For example, it could provide the central bank with real-timeinformation on deposit flows, enabling a swift reaction if needed.But overall, the risk that a digital euro could have adverse effects in times of crisis cannot be ruled out. Adigital euro should therefore be designed in a way that enables this risk to be strictly controlled, as I willdiscuss in more detail shortly.Impact on the international monetary systemThe third way in which a digital euro could have an impact on the financial system is at the cross-borderlevel. Depending on whether it would be accessible to non-residents and interoperable with non-europayment systems, a digital euro could also have far-reaching implications for the rest of the world.A digital euro accessible to non-residents could make the single currency more attractive as a safe meansof payment for retail transactions across borders. It could help tackle inefficiencies in cross-borderpayment infrastructures and make it easier to transfer remittances.But if a digital euro were not designed in a way that prevented it from being used as a form of investment,these benefits would come with the risk of amplifying international shocks. The fact that a digital eurowould be very liquid may lead to foreign investors using it disproportionately and rebalancing much moreforcefully into or away from it in response to shocks. Indeed, recent research suggests that, in thepresence of a CBDC, shocks could result in greater exchange rate fluctuations and have a stronger effecton foreign financial conditions. This, in turn, could force foreign central banks to become more responsiveto international spillovers.[]23

The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html8/14Conversely, these dynamics mean that the absence of a digital euro could make Europe more vulnerableto international developments: widespread adoption of digital currencies by foreign central banks couldmake the European economy and financial system more sensitive to shocks from abroad.Design and policy optionsTo obtain the benefits of a digital euro – such as the ability to guarantee privacy in digital payments,financial inclusion and universal access – it would need to be carefully designed. Potential design featureswere reviewed in the Eurosystem’s report[] and will be assessed in depth by the Task Force that isstudying the launch of a digital euro. Only when all issues have been addressed will we make a decisionabout whether or not to issue a digital euro.A comprehensive analysis of such design features goes beyond the scope of this seminar. I will thereforelimit my comments today to the features that are necessary to preserve the stability of the financialsystem, leaving comments on other crucial issues for another time.A digital euro should be an efficient means of payment, domestically and internationally. But crucially, inorder to preserve stability, it should be designed in a way that prevents it from being used as a form ofinvestment. A number of possible design features could satisfy these principles.One option would be to limit the amount of digital euro individual users can hold.[] This would preventlarge inflows of bank deposits – as well as volatile portfolio inflows from abroad – into the central bank.One way of doing this, while allowing the digital euro to be used for large transactions, would be to requireincoming funds in excess of a user’s limit to be redirected to a bank account. The link between privatemoney and digital euro accounts would avoid fragmentation of a user’s liquidity and would also be useful2425
10/02/2021Evolution or revolution? The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html9/14for outgoing payments. Large outgoing transactions could be conducted by transferring a combination ofdigital euro and private money.Another option would be to set a penalising remuneration on individual users’ digital euro holdings above acertain threshold.[] Up to that threshold, amounts held in digital euro would never be subject to negativeinterest rates and would thus never be treated less favourably than cash. Above that threshold,remuneration would be set so that larger digital euro holdings are only worthwhile to make largerpayments and not on an ongoing basis as a form of investment.In identifying the appropriate threshold, one would need to strike the right balance between unlocking thebenefits of a digital euro as a means of payment and mitigating risks of disintermediation or even bankruns. As a yardstick, a threshold of €3,000 would be more than the amount of cash most citizens holdtoday[] and would be above the average monthly wage in most euro area countries.Tiered remuneration could provide a less distorting way to disincentivise large digital euro holdings. At thesame time, it could present implementation challenges. For example, in times of crisis it could benecessary to adjust the remuneration of the digital currency, but this could signal that the central bank isanticipating financial tensions, leading to self-fulfilling instability.Similar design features would have to be applied to the use of a digital euro by non-residents. This wouldstop a digital euro replacing other forms of investment and facilitating currency substitution in countriesoutside the euro area. In any event, international cooperation on design, cross-border use andinteroperability would be key to reap the potential benefits of CBDCs for cross-border payments, whileaddressing risks to the international financial system.Conclusion2627
10/02/2021Evolution or revolution? The impact of a digital euro on the financial systemhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2021/html/ecb.sp210210~a1665d3188.en.html10/14Let me conclude. Just as banknotes were an important innovation for central banks and bank depositsgave commercial banks a greater role in intermediation, the ongoing digitalisation of money and paymentsis challenging the established structure of the financial system.A digital euro represents a natural evolution in response to this transformation – not only to underpinefficiency and innovation, but also to preserve the role of the central bank in offering safe means ofpayment. Throughout history, this safety has proven to be crucial in maintaining public confidence inmoney and, ultimately, in the State. A key goal of a digital euro should therefore be to preserve a finebalance between sovereign and private money to ensure payments remain stable and efficient.But as the past has taught us, if innovations in central bank money are not well designed, they canbecome a source of financial disruption. To avoid any unintended effects and reap the full benefits of adigital form of central bank money, we will carefully consider all aspects of its design.Our recent public consultation on a digital euro is part of this exercise. In the spring we will publish ananalysis of the replies we received. This analysis will provide important input into our decision, towards themiddle of the year, about whether or not to formally launch a project to prepare for the issuance of a digitaleuro.As our work on a digital euro moves forward, the views of citizens, businesses, banks and all stakeholderswill continue to be of utmost importance in ensuring that a digital euro would be optimally designed and,ultimately, serve Europeans well.1.

Goldilocks and the threepillars: how much capital isjust right? - speech by AnnaSweeneyiSpeech given at the Westminster Business ForumGoldilocks and the three pillars: how much capital is just right? ‐ speech by Anna Sweeney | Bank of England Page 1
Published on 10 February 2021OverviewAnna Sweeney says regulators must strike the right balance when they decide how much capital insurers need tohold. The three pillars she refers to are the different ways we regulate insurers. They are: the capital an insurer holdsits risk management policiesits disclosure of risksSpeechWe are all familiar with the story of Goldilocks and the three bears. When preparing this speech I was surprised, anda little disturbed, to discover that in the first recorded version of the story, it is not a pretty young girl who enters theforest home of three bears, but a badly-behaved old woman, an outcast from her family. After wreaking havoc in thebears’ house she jumps out of the window, and is never seen again. (Let’s hope that the bears had good contentsinsurance.)In this earlier telling of the story, the visitor to the bears’ house is a caricature, and not a sympathetic one:I really don’t want to repeat some of the adjectives applied to her. But I do have empathy, because regulators arealso sometimes caricatured – in our case as single-mindedly risk averse, driven by an incentive to avoid firm failure,and paying insufficient attention to counter-balancing commercial incentives. Like any caricature, this one starts witha single distinctive feature – it is the job of the regulator to uphold prudential standards particularly in good timeswhen the long term benefit, indeed necessity of maintaining standards is easily overlooked – and then magnifies thatone characteristic to the exclusion of all else. Today I want to look past the caricature and explain how we reallythink about the relationship between capital requirements and the rest of the prudential regime, in the context of thegovernment’s review of Solvency II.Goals of the review of Solvency IIWhat does the PRA hope that the review will achieve? We are committed to upholding the principles of Solvency II –they are our principles, and given the amount invested by firms in implementing the Solvency II regime, we see noappetite to tear them up and start again. The top level goal of the review is instead to tailor a regime based on thoseprinciples to the UK market. The government has translated[1] this into three objectives:These are consistent and mutually supportive objectives. Safety and soundness underpin the other two objectives:the sector can only be internationally competitive if it operates within a robust and reliable infrastructure, whichincludes the prudential regime as well as things like the legal system; and only a financially sound insurance sectorto spur a vibrant, innovative, and internationally competitive insurance sector;to protect policyholders and ensure the safety and soundness of firms; and tosupport insurance firms to provide long-term capital to support growth, including investment in infrastructure,venture capital and growth equity, and other long-term productive assets, as well as investment consistent withthe government’s climate change objectives.Goldilocks and the three pillars: how much capital is just right? ‐ speech by Anna Sweeney | Bank of England Page 2
can make a sustainable contribution to long term investment. Conversely, an innovative sector, that supports thewider economy through long term investment, is ultimately a sounder one.Tailoring will mean reforms to specific aspects of the regime that are not well-designed or imperfectly calibrated forthe UK, and are currently distorting incentives and behaviour. The risk margin is probably the best known example.The concept – a margin over best estimate of liabilities so that they are held on the regulatory balance sheet at anestimate of their transfer value – is sound. But in its current implementation the output of the risk margin formula istoo sensitive to interest rates[2], and when rates are low it is higher than it need be to fulfil its purpose. And this hasdriven a misallocation of capital, away from longevity risk, a misallocation which is relentlessly increasing asvolumes of business not covered by transitional measures grow.Overall outcome of the reviewWe are working on these and other specific topics, and looking forward to receiving views in response to HMT’s callfor evidence which closes later this month. It is important to get these reforms right. But we cannot consider reformsto individual measures in isolation: at the end of the process we have to be confident that the package of measurescontinues to deliver the right overall level of resilience at firm and sector level and supply of financial servicesdemanded by the economy. That has always been the reality – calibration of individual measures has to derive bothfrom bottom up analysis and top down assessment of their cumulative impact. The fact that the risk margin is toohigh for its own purpose does not mean that when everything is added up, overall levels of resilience are themselveswrong.To be clear, though, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) enters this review with no goal of either decreasing orincreasing total capital in the sector. In fact at this stage we have not been presented with persuasive evidence thatcurrent levels are manifestly too high or too low. The sector has so far shown itself resilient to the financialconsequences of the severe shock represented by the Covid-19 pandemic. But equally, the supply of insuranceseems in the round to meet demand from the economy.Moreover, we do not think about capital requirements in isolation, but as part of a three pillar regulatory regime(comprising capital, risk management, and disclosure). Today I want to talk a little about how we think about capitaladequacy within that broader framework, and specifically the interplay with strength of market discipline, the ladderof intervention, and the way that firms structure themselves. In the light of those factors, how do we judge when thelevel of capital is ‘just right’?The three pillar regulatory regimeLast year I talked about what the insurance sector does for the wider economy[3], which itself defines our mission ininsurance supervision: the protection of policyholders and the stability of the supply of financial services to the widereconomy. Broadly speaking, those services are the pooling of risk, provision of secure retirement income, and longterm investment. The safety and soundness of individual firms is a primary objective, but is not really an end in itself,it is a means to fulfilling our mission. We do not have zero appetite for failure of individual firms, provided that they doso in an orderly way that does not impose large costs or disruption on policyholders – neither in the form of directlosses nor of disruption – does not have knock on effects elsewhere in the financial system, and there is sufficientcapacity elsewhere to substitute for the loss of the failing firm.We cannot leave this all to the market. Intervention in the form of prudential regulation is necessary because of theinverted production cycle in insurance – policies pay out after, in many cases long after, they are taken out –because of the limited or non-existent ability of many policyholders to monitor or react to increases in risk taking bytheir insurer during the life of their policy, and because of the incentive for managers and limited liability shareholdersto increase risk if their capital stake drops too low – so called gambling for resurrection.These market failures are addressed not just by capital requirements, but by the interplay between capital and theother two pillars of the regime.Goldilocks and the three pillars: how much capital is just right? ‐ speech by Anna Sweeney | Bank of England Page 3
Pillar 3: market disciplinePillar 3 is disclosure of information about a firm’s balance sheet risks. Market discipline is not wholly absent fromthe insurance sector either at the inception of or during the course of policies. Some policyholders and creditors areable to monitor and react to changes in the creditworthiness of insurance firms. Clearly, for those that can, goodquality, timely disclosures enhance market discipline.Where market discipline is strong, there is less need for stringent regulatory minima. But the strength of marketdiscipline varies widely across the sector, according to the nature of policies and policyholders, as well as beingdifferent at the point of purchase and during the subsequent life of a contract – often measured in years not months.Moreover, there is another, essential element of the regime that serves to reduce market discipline. This is not apillar but a net strung between the pillars. Large classes of policyholder would suffer significant hardship if theirinsurer failed, but have either no way of observing that it is courting failure, or no way of switching to a safer firm –often both. Annuitants are an obvious example. So such policyholders are offered an unlimited, 100% safety net bythe FSCS. Certain general insurance products are in the same camp, and not just indemnities covering potentiallyruinous liabilities to third parties: indeed, last year we extended 100% cover to certain building guarantees policieswhen it became clear that they met the criteria of significant hardship and inability to switch provider. So far so good,and the safety net promotes competition by giving consumers confidence in purchasing insurance and shoppingaround. But of course the existence of this safety net blunts the policyholder incentive to distinguish between a highrisk and a low risk insurer at the point of taking out a policy. Paradoxically the stronger the safety net, the strongerthe other two regulatory pillars need to be to hold it up. The less the market and policyholders discipline a firm, themore the regulator needs to do it for them, including by policing financial standards.Pillar 2: intervention and risk managementPillar 2 contains a range of qualitative measures, but broadly speaking they can be divided into the ladder ofintervention, and requirements for good risk management, including the prudent person principle. These are bothintimately connected to how we define capital adequacy.The ladder of intervention is critical to preventing gambling for resurrection: it formalizes and defines the power tointervene before the interests of shareholders and policyholders diverge, in the same way that debt covenants protectcreditors by giving them the ability to intervene in clearly defined circumstances under which their interests willdiverge from those of the providers of equity capital. The role of regulatory capital in relation to the ladder is to buytime for that intervention. It needs to be enough to withstand extreme but plausible events for long enough to allow anassessment of whether the firm can be rescued as a going concern – or whether changes in the external world haveholed the business model below the water line: no amount of capital can keep a broken business model afloat forever. Rather, capital is like the bulkheads in the sinking ship: they don’t necessarily need to hold back the waterforever, but must slow down its ingress for long enough to get the passengers and crew safely into the lifeboats. Howlong the defences are needed depends on the design of the ship – where are the lifeboats, are they clearlysignposted, how many stairwells are there from the lower decks, and so on.So ease of exit is a crucial factor in capital adequacy too: how confident are we that policyholders can be protectedin a worst case scenario, i.e. that if the firm is closed to new business the run off will be a solvent one. Do existingconcentrations get worse or new ones arise during run off? Do new liabilities or exposures appear e.g. through highercollateral requirements or even forced close out by derivatives counterparties? The less confident we are that the firmcan exit in an orderly way, the more remote we need to make the prospect of failure and the larger the cushion offinancial resources we will need to see at the point of intervention.Uncertainty and capital adequacyEase of exit is a consequence of the good risk management that pillar 2 requires of firms: risk management that isforward looking and prepares for unpalatable scenarios by structuring the balance sheet and business modelappropriately. Good risk management is also about organising the firm in a way that allows the adequacy of theGoldilocks and the three pillars: how much capital is just right? ‐ speech by Anna Sweeney | Bank of England Page 4
capital base to be sensibly assessed, and the judgement about any need for intervention to be made in a timelyway.In any balance sheet there will be risks that can be quantified, and there will be uncertainties that cannot.Uncertainties emerge for example, from reliance on unobservable assumptions or indeed concentration of exposureto any single risk factor on either side of the balance sheet. Another pertinent example is reliance on matchingadjustment for illiquid assets: market prices of such assets are not directly observable and the calibration of thematching adjustment benefit relies on further splitting that unobservable spread into unobservable credit and liquiditycomponents: so heavy reliance on the resulting matching adjustment is a source of material, inherent uncertainty.The greater the exposure to uncertainty, from any source, the less confidence we can have in the adequacy of thecapital determined by a quantitative model. Beyond a certain level, concentrations and other exposures to irreducibleuncertainty simply make it impossible to say that any feasible level of capital is adequate to play the part it needs toin delivering policyholder protection. That is not a viable business model for a regulated financial firm and the remedylies not in higher capital – which will do little if anything to address that irreducible lack of confidence in adequacy –but in restructuring the balance sheet and business model.A balanced approachI have discussed how capital requirements interact with other factors that vary across the sector and between firms –the strength of market discipline, the ladder of intervention, ease of exit – and also given an example of an importantsource of lack of resilience that cannot be remedied with capital: the susceptibility of balance sheet and enterpriserisks to modelling. Arguments about the level of capital need to be rooted in these factors: it is not enough to assertthat, if only we didn’t have to hold so much capital, our policies could be so much cheaper, we could supply somany more of them, and we could expand our investments. If only it were that simple.I recognise that there is an opportunity cost to higher regulatory capital: capital that supports the risks in existingbusiness cannot also be used to support acquisitions or expansion into innovative fields. But price is not the sameas value. The bears may have seen their bargain flat pack furniture in a different light when they discovered howeasily the chairs were broken by a little girl. Similarly, financial services supplied by undercapitalized firms are poorvalue as they cannot be relied on. And if policyholders cannot reliably distinguish the sound firms from the others,the whole sector is tainted – to the cost of us all as economic activity that relies on being able to lay offunsupportable risks is depressed. On the other hand, if prices are unnecessarily high that can also reduce or preventrisk transfer, and this can have a knock-on effect on economic activity and long-term investment. There is a balanceto be struck.As I said in my opening remarks, I do not believe that we have that balance badly wrong at the moment. I hope that Ihave convinced you that, like Goldilocks in the more familiar version of the story, regulators do want to get it justright: we aren’t continually hankering after the largest chair, the softest bed, or the hottest porridge. And we are asopen to evidence about what constitutes ‘just right’ as we are to how best to correct the distortions introduced by thecurrent design and calibration of specific measures in the regime. It is in the interests of firms and the people of theUnited Kingdom, whose interests the Bank of England exists to serve, that we have that debate and that it beinformed not by caricatures of each other’s positions, but by a shared understanding of both the costs and benefitsof the capital element of prudential regulation, as well as its place in the wider regime.I would like to thank Alan Sheppard, Anthony Brown, Charlotte Gerken, David Humphry, and Manuel Sales for theirhelp in preparing these remarks.1. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/solvency-ii-review-call-for-evidence2.

Welcome addressIgnazio Visco Governor of the Bank of ItalyBank of Italy workshop on: “The crisis management framework for banks in the EU. How can we deal with the crisis of small and medium-sized banks?”Online event, 15 January 2021• It is my pleasure to open this workshop on “The crisis management framework for banks in the EU. How can we deal with the crisis of small and medium-sized banks?” As is well known, in 2015 the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) introduced a new crisis management regime for the European Union. The purpose of the directive was to tackle the “too-big-to-fail” problem and eliminate the need for bail-outs with public funds in the event of bank failures.• The focus of this reform – in line with the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institution published by the FSB in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2007-08 – was on systemically important banks, i.e. those banks whose failure would likely threaten financial stability and have severe repercussions on the real economy at home and abroad. During the global financial crisis, as well as in previous crisis episodes, the bail-out of such institutions was very costly for governments and, ultimately, taxpayers. Therefore, the solution envisaged at the global level was to internalise the losses through the implementation of the “bail-in”, the main tool underpinning the new resolution framework. By shifting the cost of the crisis from taxpayers to investors and creditors, the framework also intended to reduce moral hazard and restore the level playing field for larger and smaller banks, by eliminating the implicit subsidies enjoyed by the former.• However, less attention has been paid so far to banks that are not systemic, namely the small and medium-sized banks that, in the European Union, represent the vast majority. So far, our understanding has been that the new resolution regime is only applicable to a small subset of banks and banking groups: in the euro area only around 200 banks out of a total of about 3,000 as of end-2019. Any crisis among the remaining banks should therefore be dealt with via national insolvency procedures.• Yet small and medium-sized banks contribute to a great extent to the financing of the economy. Less significant institutions (LSIs) hold 19 per cent of the total assets 
2of the banking sector in the euro area; in some countries – such as Austria, Germany, Ireland and Luxembourg – this share rises to over one-third.• In addition, small and medium-sized banks could be those suffering the most from the economic consequences of the pandemic. Could this create an unprecedented “too-many-to-fail” problem, difficult to address within the current framework? A recent Bank of Italy analysis confirms that the effect of the pandemic on Italian banks’ credit risk exposure could be higher among less significant institutions than among significant ones, due to the different sectoral composition of the loan portfolios of the two groups.• National insolvency procedures are very heterogeneous across EU member States. For example, some countries have special regimes applicable only to banks, while others have ordinary insolvency regimes applicable to all kinds of firms; some implement judicial-based frameworks while others administrative-based frameworks. This variety creates a level-playing-field problem, as creditors and depositors may be treated differently across the Union, thus fuelling financial fragmentation.• A greater degree of harmonisation of the national insolvency procedures for non-systemic banks is therefore necessary to strengthen the Banking Union and the single market. How, then, can we bring this about? And, most importantly, how should any new EU framework be shaped? • The main objective of any revision of the current framework should be to avoid disorderly piecemeal liquidations, with the consequent unnecessary destruction of value. In Europe this objective is actively pursued in the field of insolvency procedures for non-financial firms, for which harmonisation efforts are ongoing. It should also be pursued, a fortiori, in the banking field, where it is crucial not only to avoid destroying value, but also to preserve public confidence in the banking system.• Disorderly liquidations may have instead become more likely in recent years, due to several factors. Technological progress and changing customer habits are inducing banks to downsize their branch network: a key effect of this phenomenon is the reduced appetite of banks for acquiring ailing institutions. The economic crisis is also creating “overcapacity” in the EU banking sector, which, on average, struggles to remunerate capital, further diminishing returns on mergers and acquisitions. Under these conditions, the “franchise value” of ailing banks is small and potential buyers are often willing to enter into a deal only at negative prices.• As is well known, piecemeal liquidation would lead to the immediate disruption of the bank’s core activities. Assets would have to be disposed of quickly at fire sale prices and collateral would have to be enforced; non-insured liability holders would have to face long delays to obtain only partial reimbursement; borrowers – especially small enterprises – could be exposed to liquidity constraints, which could then evolve into solvency problems. Confidence in other banks could be 
23shaken, amplifying the risks for the economy at large. Unsurprisingly, disorderly piecemeal liquidation has so far been largely untested.•At present, there is nothing in the EU crisis management framework to preventthe difficulties of a non-systemic bank from evolving into a disorderly piecemealliquidation. This fundamental weakness of the framework has not gone unnoticed.In the Financial Sector Assessment Program for the euro area, the IMF called fora common legal framework for liquidation featuring “purchase and assumption”transactions (a transfer of business – assets and liabilities, business branches andlegal relationships) supported by a European deposit guarantee scheme. The IMFargued that a transfer of assets and liabilities, instead of a piecemeal liquidation,would reduce the destruction of value and ensure a level playing field for creditors.•Ensuring that adequate and proportionate solutions exist to manage the failureof banks, while preserving their franchise value, is among the objectives that theEuropean Commission intends to pursue, as part of the agenda for the completionof the Banking Union. This would be a key step to increasing the effectiveness andefficiency of the crisis management and deposit insurance frameworks.•One fundamental question concerns the sources of funding to finance a transferstrategy, be it in resolution or in liquidation. Under the current BRRD framework,a successful resolution strategy premised on the bail-in tool requires adequate levels of eligible liabilities (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities,MREL), preferably subordinated, to avoid losses being imposed on depositors andother retail creditors.•However, most medium-sized banks (not to mention smaller ones) are notequipped to tap capital markets in order to issue MREL instruments. Around 70per cent of the significant banks under the direct supervision of the ECB are notlisted, 60 per cent have never issued convertible instruments, and 25 per cent havenot even issued subordinated debt. These shares rise sharply, of course, for smallerinstitutions. Requiring these banks to issue MREL-eligible liabilities to non-retailinvestors would therefore force them to resort to the wholesale market, obtain acredit rating and change their funding structure significantly. It could thereforehave a strong impact on banks’ margins and even force some of them out of themarket, since issuance costs could prove too high to bear.•One possibility to overcome these problems is to finance the transfer of assets andliabilities of the failed bank to a viable third party with the support of a depositguarantee scheme, as suggested by the IMF. Bail-in would then be applicable onlyto banks able to tap capital markets to build up enough MREL without radicallymodifying their funding structure, in line with the original aim of the reform, whichwas to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem. For all other banks, the depositguarantee scheme would be responsible for ensuring an orderly exit from themarket, without unnecessary destruction of value and spillover effects.•A number of legal constraints in the European framework currently hinderthis possibility and should therefore be removed. I have already advanced this
4consideration years ago, also mentioning the role played in the United States by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank of Italy has contributed to identifying some of these constraints and has put forward proposals, drawing also from the US experience, which has successfully managed a large number of crises of small banks.• The resulting differentiation between larger banks – subject to MREL and bail-in – and smaller banks – subject to a different and less costly treatment – could be justified on the basis of the proportionality principle, as well as with reference to the objective of preserving the valuable business model of small institutions that rely extensively (if not almost exclusively) on deposit taking and credit lending. Non-systemic banks would actually struggle to survive should their creditors start moving to larger banks because risks are perceived to be substantially lower. The proposed policy would then contribute to preserving some bio-diversity in the EU banking system, which would be beneficial for financial stability as a whole.• Indeed, this would be in line with the original aim of addressing the “too-big-to-fail” problem. Larger banks would have to pay the price for their size, consistently with the higher systemic risk they pose in the event of failure and in line with other strands of the regulatory framework, such as the capital requirements, which are more stringent for larger banks.• With regard to the risk of moral hazard that the different treatment of smaller banks could generate, the argument that uninsured depositors or senior bondholders should participate in absorbing losses in order to fend off this risk seems a feeble one. In the case of smaller banks, in fact, these are often individual households and small firms, who are not able to adequately monitor financial intermediaries. Forcing them to do so, even supposing this were possible, would entail substantial inefficiencies, not to mention the risk of triggering bank runs. Moreover, we must also bear in mind that imposing losses on the creditors of small and medium-sized banks in the absence of adequate MREL buffers would end up hitting their deposits, with possible negative spillover effects on other small banks.• Today’s workshop provides an important opportunity to discuss these issues and explore views and suggestions that, hopefully, will contribute in a constructive way to the debate on how to improve the crisis management framework for small banks. So let me thank all the presenters, discussants and panellists who will share their views with us and provide useful insights on how to foster a safer financial system and a better economy.

TM‘The G20 agenda in 2021, under Italy’s leadership’Global Investor Roundtable of the Global FoundationSpeech by Daniele Franco Senior Deputy Governor of the Banca d’ItaliaRome, 3 February 20211. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to contribute to the 2021 Global Investor Roundtable of the Global Foundation. Let me thank the Secretary General Steve Howard for inviting me and for his kind introduction. Governor Visco addressed the Rome Roundtable last November and illustrated the prospects for the Italian Presidency of the Group of Twenty (G20). I will update you on recent developments. I would like to start off by saying a few words about the context in which Italy began its Presidency. 2. We all know that the current global crisis is one of unprecedented magnitude. Since the inception of the pandemic, more than 100 million individuals have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide; almost 30 million cases have been recorded in Europe. More than 2 million people have died because of it, about one third of them in Europe.The pandemic, combined with the containment measures introduced to curb the spread of the virus, plunged the world economy into one of the deepest recessions in recent history. In 2020, despite a short spell of recovery during the summer, world GDP declined by about 3.5 per cent, the largest contraction since WWII. Economic losses in the euro area and the UK have been particularly severe. Fiscal and monetary authorities responded swiftly with massive expansionary interventions. The measures were aimed at strengthening the healthcare systems, at supporting firms’ and households, and at preserving orderly monetary and financial conditions.The short-term objective of mitigating the immediate consequences of the pandemic was achieved, preventing the drying-up of liquidity, avoiding an immediate 
2credit crunch that could have led to a large wave of defaults, and taming deflationary pressures that would have scarred the economic fabric of our economies and generated financial instability. 3. According to the latest projections released by the IMF, global economic activity will surpass pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2021, with world GDP growing by 5.5 per cent. The forecast has been revised positively, in light of expectations that vaccines would remove current restrictions in the second half of the year. However, projections are heterogeneous across world regions, owing to the differences in the access to healthcare, the effectiveness of relief measures, the exposure to cross-country spillovers, and structural characteristics. Furthermore, large uncertainty still surrounds the evolution of the epidemic, reflecting new waves of contagion, new variants of the virus and the distribution of vaccines. In this context, the timing and the effectiveness of the distribution of vaccines is of paramount importance to reinforce the confidence of households and firms, a crucial ingredient for a balanced, sustained and inclusive recovery.4. Policy-makers are now confronted with the need to speed up and strengthen the recovery. Inclusion is important: the pandemic has exacerbated inequalities. The better-off are more likely to work from home and be better equipped to study from home. This task is challenging.First of all, it is important that the phasing-out of the measures is designed carefully, avoiding that a premature removal of support holds back the pace of the recovery, while still preventing a possible misallocation of resources. At the same time, setting the stage for a long-lasting recovery requires tackling some structural global challenges, some of which have lacked a determined policy response since even before the pandemic.5. It is under these exceptional circumstances that last December Italy assumed the Presidency of the G20, laying out its priorities on the basis of three pillars: People, Planet and Prosperity. The Finance Track of the G20 is focused on current developments and policy actions. We are closely monitoring progress on the commitments and objectives laid out in the Action Plan, endorsed last April by the G20 Leaders to provide a coordinated response to the crisis, and updated in October. As a living document, the Action Plan will be updated again, taking into account the evolution of the health and economic situation. We are building on the excellent results achieved under the Saudi Presidency.In the meeting of the G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies on January 25th-26th, the Italian Presidency received broad consensus on the priorities, initiatives and work plans of the different working groups: the Framework Working Group (FWG), the Infrastructure Working Group (IWG), and the International Finance Architecture (IFA) Working Group. 
23The Framework Working Group will focus on three objectives: ensuring that the policy mix remains appropriate to address the economic consequences of the pandemic crisis; exploiting the opportunities of the digital transformation to boost productivity; monitoring global risks, including those arising from non-economic factors, such as climate-related ones. The work program of the Infrastructure Working Group in 2021 is built around four pillars: resilience and maintenance, digitalization, sustainability, and social inclusion. While infrastructure investment is an important lever for supporting the post-COVID recovery, the common goal is to look beyond the short term and embark on an infrastructure agenda that can contribute to a lasting broad-based prosperity.As for the International Finance Architecture Working Group, we need to preserve international financial stability whilst transitioning from the emergency response to the crisis towards the recovery stage. The work of this group will focus on four main areas: debt, global financial resilience, the financing needs of vulnerable countries, and the implications of the rise of digital currencies for the International Monetary System. 6. The G20 Finance Track also strives to sustain the recovery by developing long-term strategies to foster the transformation towards greener, more digital and inclusive societies. Today – looking beyond the current situation – I would like to touch upon three of the most pressing challenges that the world economy is facing in the coming years. They are core themes of the agenda of the Italian Presidency: climate change, future potential pandemics, and financial inclusion.Some of these were policy priorities even before the COVID-19 pandemic. The shock has nevertheless brought about some swift structural transformations, together with new opportunities, that make it all the more urgent to address these issues in a coordinated and effective manner, without any complacency.7. Protecting our planet means building more resilient societies and tackling the climate challenge. The natural environment is being threatened by the effects of climate change, with increasing repercussions on our economies. Last year, together with 2016, was the warmest on record. We must curb the carbon footprint of human activities. This is going to be expensive and complex under many dimensions, from the technical to the political. Based on alternative scenarios regarding the timeline and the intensity of the introduction of risk mitigation policies, defined by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), a worldwide group of about 70 central banks and supervisors, the picture that emerges warrants resolute action. To allow a smooth transition to net zero CO2 emissions by 2070, keeping the rise in global temperature within 2°C, in line with the Paris Agreement goal, policy response must be prompt, extensive and coordinated. Delays and hesitation would only force more costly and brutal adjustments in the future.
4An ambitious Green Agenda is at the core of the Italian G20 Presidency. We believe the Finance Track should bring sustainability back to the centre of the policy agenda, making the climate challenge a cross-cutting priority across all of its activities. At the G20 level, we have been exploring the issues related to sustainable finance and climate change since 2016.The Italian Presidency has proposed to re-establish the Sustainable Finance Study Group which will take stock of the recent developments on sustainable finance and climate risks, with the ultimate goal of suggesting a ‘sustainable’ growth path. The urgency of the recovery could renew momentum and reshape our economic model around a low-carbon strategy: improving energy efficiency, deploying renewables and energy storage and developing carbon capture technologies. The works of the group under the Italian Presidency will mainly focus on improving the quality, availability and comparability of data to assess climate-related issues and, more generally, sustainability, financial risks, and opportunities. The group could also investigate the areas of future action to achieve the sustainable development agenda of the United Nations, in particular access to modern forms of sustainable energy and natural capital conservation and restoration.The transition to a zero-emissions economy can be fostered by the financial system, given its key role in the allocation of resources. Several analyses show that incorporating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in investment strategies does not hamper their financial performance. The risk-adjusted returns to sustainable investment are indeed often higher than those achieved using traditional financial models. During the recent market turmoil, the preferences of financial investors for sustainable investments have proven resilient. Another important venue to discuss all possible instruments to reach carbon neutrality, including ‘climate cooperation’, will be this year’s Conference of the Parties (COP26), under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The coincidence of Italy being President of the G20 and co-chair of the COP26 (the other chair is the UK, which is President of the G7) may allow us to bring forward the climate change agenda on many fronts simultaneously, such as the involvement of the private sector in the financing of the green agenda. 8. The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing global health crisis have clearly highlighted the costs of extreme health emergencies. The risk of another pandemic is high. In 2018, in an article for the World Health Organisation (WHO), Larry Summers and two distinguished public health scholars wrote that: ‘Few doubt that major epidemics and pandemics will strike again and few would argue that the world is adequately prepared’.1 Evidently, last year we were not prepared. A broad-based global effort to improve prevention, surveillance, preparedness is of the utmost importance, in a ‘health for all’ perspective. 1 Fan, J., D. Jamison and L. Summers (2018) ‘Pandemic risk: how large are the expected losses?’ Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 96:129-134.
54While massive efforts are under way in a strict health policy sense – in developing and distributing vaccines, testing capacity and treatments, strengthening disease surveillance networks and global protocols for health emergencies – a deficiency in funding has emerged. The current architecture does not allow a timely mobilization of resources to respond to pandemics and support global preparedness. Achieving this goal cannot be the responsibility of one country in isolation or of a single institution alone as health is cross cutting and multi-sectoral in nature and is at the centre of economic resilience.Approving the proposal of the Italian Presidency, in the first G20 Finance and Central Bank Deputies meeting of January 25th-26th, the G20 Members agreed to establish a High Level Independent Panel (HLIP) on financing the global commons for pandemic preparedness and response. The Panel will leverage the WHO’s assessment of gaps in pandemic preparedness and the ongoing international initiatives to enhance it. It will interact with the main relevant global health actors and will identify the specific gaps in the financing system and propose solutions to meet them on a systematic basis. It will consider how to optimally leverage resources from the public, private and philanthropic sectors and International Financial Institutions. The Panel ensures broad regional and gender balance, and comprises eminent individuals. Its conclusions are supposed to be an input for the Joint G20 Meeting of Finance and Health Ministers scheduled for next October.9. Providing access to affordable and useful financial products – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – is key to support development and growth. If accompanied by financial literacy, it allows individuals and companies to generate income, to manage volatile cash flow, to plan investments and to strengthen resilience to income fluctuations and shocks.The G20 has been very active in promoting the goal of ‘not leaving anyone behind’ in the access to finance, in particular through the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI). In 2021 the GPFI, of which Italy is one of the newly appointed Co-Chairs, will focus on digital financial inclusion of both individuals and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). The shift towards digitalization in services represents a great opportunity for expanding access to finance; at the same time, it can increase financial exclusion unless it is supported by appropriate literacy, both financial and digital, and by adequate governance. Digital transformation enhances financial inclusion if it effectively reaches the most vulnerable and financially underserved, including micro and small enterprises, and if these individuals and businesses are equipped with the financial competences that allow them to make informed decisions. We must ensure that a wider access to digital financial infrastructure does not translate into irresponsible financial behavior, which can, in turn, endanger growth and financial stability.To fulfil the work plan commitments, the G20 Presidency mandated some Implementing Partners (IPs) – including the OECD, the SME Finance Forum and the 
World Bank – to provide analyses and stock-tracking reports on the gaps and opportunities, in terms of digital financial inclusion, that emerged during the pandemic crisis. As to policy response, we will concentrate on two main areas. One concerns raising digital financial awareness for both households and MSMEs. The other one aims to foster innovative regulatory and supervisory approaches that encourage the development of inclusive and responsible digital financial services while granting adequate protection to final customers, including from cyber risk. The 2021 GPFI’s focus on digital financial inclusion will also take into account remittances and the most effective actions needed to support them, also in times of crisis. 10. I have briefly touched upon three themes of the agenda of the G20 Finance Track under the Italian Presidency. All three challenges – climate change, preparedness in health policy and financial inclusion – must find adequate and coordinated responses in order to advance onto a ‘sustained’ and ‘sustainable’ recovery path. Great uncertainty still surrounds the evolution of the epidemic and the related economic developments; the outlook is nevertheless positive. It is therefore essential that we enter a new phase in which our tasks move toward a more far-sighted policy perspective. We must address the legacies of this unprecedented crisis and some structural long-standing challenges, for the prosperity of our communities. The G20 is the proper world forum for that. Global issues – such as climate change and pandemics – require global solutions. Designed by the Printing and Publishing Division of the Bank of Italy6
