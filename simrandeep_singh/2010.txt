BIS Review 38/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Laudatio for Hans Tietmeyer Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), at Münster City Hall, Westphalia, 26 March 2010. *      *      * Lord Mayor, Mr Hillebrandt, Dear Hans, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here giving this speech in honour of my dear friend Hans Tietmeyer. The Westfalen-Initiative has made an excellent decision in inducting Hans Tietmeyer and Freiherr vom Stein (1757–1831) into the Westfälische Ehrengalerie [Westphalian Gallery of Honour]. Induction into the Westfälische Ehrengalerie is a means of honouring prominent Westphalians for their services to the region. Of course, the achievements of Hans Tietmeyer, like those of Freiherr vom Stein, can be seen far beyond Westphalia.  The historical significance of this city hall also extends way beyond Westphalia. It has played host to pivotal events in the history of Europe, having witnessed the negotiation and conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia more than 360 years ago. The Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück formed the basis for the establishment of peace in Europe following the Thirty Years War. Hans Tietmeyer has also participated in pivotal events in Europe’s history. Indeed, he played a decisive role in laying the legal foundations for Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union. The introduction of the single currency represents the greatest achievement to date in the history of European integration – a process which has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe.  Today, Europe faces further pivotal decisions. The global financial crisis has resulted in major challenges for Europe’s economic and fiscal policies. I will talk more about these issues at the end of my speech. I had the pleasure of spending many years working with Hans – particularly between 1987 and 1999. Initially, Hans was Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance and I was Director of the Treasury. Later, our periods as the governors of our respective central banks coincided. When the ECB was established, we both became members of the Governing Council of the ECB. It was Hans who proposed not using members’ countries of origin to determine the seating plan for the Governing Council’s meetings and instead using alphabetical order to decide who sits next to whom. After all, the members of the Governing Council are there to represent the euro area as a whole. But maybe Hans just wanted to sit next to me. Because there is not much that fits between Tietmeyer and Trichet, also in the alphabet. I always greatly appreciated working with him, and I learnt a lot from him about Germany.  Hans Tietmeyer’s period as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank coincided with turbulence in the international financial markets. By comparison with the recent global financial crisis, the Mexican crisis and the Asian crisis were less dramatic from a European perspective. Nevertheless, Hans Tietmeyer recognised at an early stage the threat that unstable financial markets could pose to a globalised world economy, and it was on his initiative that the Financial Stability Forum was established in 1999. Ten years later, one of the responses to the global financial crisis was the enhancement of the Financial Stability Forum, which became the Financial Stability Board. The number of participants was 
2 BIS Review 38/2010 increased and its remit was extended. The Financial Stability Board has thereby become a key institution in the reform of the international financial system. Above all, though, Hans Tietmeyer’s time at the Bundesbank was marked by preparations for Monetary Union. His tireless support for rules ensuring the stability of the single currency has proved to be entirely justified. The euro area’s 330 million or so citizens are now benefiting from the fact that the currency in their wallets is as solid as the Deutsche Mark used to be (“so hart wie die D-Mark”). The euro – a stable currency The euro is just as strong as the most stable of its predecessors. The ECB has ensured price stability in the euro area. At the end of this year, the average inflation rate since 1999 will, in all probability, be around 1.95% – i.e. just under 2%. Thus, the euro need not shy away from comparisons with the Deutsche Mark. The average inflation rate in Germany in the 1990s prior to the introduction of the euro was 2.2%. In the 1980s it was 2.9%. Many people still don’t want to believe it, but the euro has not increased inflation. However, price stability is by no means the only advantage that Germany enjoys as a result of Monetary Union. Without the euro, the financial crisis would certainly have triggered additional turbulence on the currency markets, also causing further damage to the German economy. People like Hans and me who were directly involved in the EMS crisis know what they are talking about. In his book “The euro challenge”, his memories of the events of 1992 and 1993 are headed – appropriately, I think – “monetary earthquake” and “strong aftershock”. The successful resolution of that crisis is another one of Hans Tietmeyer’s lasting achievements. Europe’s monetary integration could have ended in failure as a result of that episode. Price stability is, without a doubt, the best contribution that central banks can make to people’s well-being. Nevertheless, many people virtually don’t take much notice of their central banks’ operations in normal times. Furthermore, the mechanism for the transmission of monetary policy decisions is very complicated. This makes it all the more important for people to be able to rely on the delivery of price stability. In the case of the ECB and the Eurosystem, they can rely on it. Price stability is our primary objective. The Governing Council has defined price stability as increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2% over the medium term. The Governing Council has, in addition, specified that it strives for increases of “below, but close to, 2%”. With the aid of this quantitative definition, we have succeeded in firmly anchoring inflation expectations at a low level. This has been of great assistance to us during periods of both increasing and decreasing inflationary pressures. The central banks have worked hard for those low inflation expectations, which have been achieved primarily as a result of decades of credibly following stability-oriented policies. Those inflation expectations are of fundamental importance for the success of monetary policy. It would therefore be a very serious mistake to aim for a higher level of inflation in the future. Consequently, as I have stressed on a number of occasions, I strongly oppose this idea. Pandora’s box must remain shut. The weakening of our price stability objective is out of the question. Price stability benefits us all. It safeguards purchasing power and the value of savings, and it prevents the arbitrary redistribution of wealth. Only in the presence of price stability does the price mechanism function in an efficient and transparent manner. It is the main instrument for the steering of our market economy. 
BIS Review 38/2010 3 Independence guarantees a stability-oriented monetary policy An important requirement for the delivery of price stability is the independence of the central bank. We know this as a result of the painful learning processes that central banks have undergone in the past. Germany was one of the first countries to have an independent central bank. I myself was Governor of the Banque de France when it became fully independent. Central bank independence was “Europeanised” and became the model for the ECB. On 1 January 1994, more than 16 years ago, I saw for myself the enormous difference that it makes to preside over a fully independent institution. It has now long been demonstrated – both theoretically and empirically – that central banks are better able to ensure low and stable levels of inflation when they are independent. Of course, independence does not mean arbitrariness. Instead, that independence is tied to a concrete objective. And independence requires accountability. In the case of the ECB, its mandate specifies that the delivery of price stability is its primary objective. The quantitative definition of price stability does not just contribute to the anchoring of inflation expectations. It also provides people with an objective yardstick with which to judge our work. The mandate and the independence of the Eurosystem are enshrined in Europe’s treaties. These are quasi-constitutional in nature. Monetary policy has been removed from the remit of national politics. At the same time, the ECB – like other central banks – cannot complain that it has lacked advice from politicians. This is something of a tradition when it comes to independent central banks. Don’t forget Adenauer’s famous “guillotine speech” in 1956. Half a century later, Heads of State or Government attempted – again, unsuccessfully – to influence the monetary policy of the ECB. When growth weakened in 2003 and 2004 the then leaders of the three large euro area countries demanded an instant reduction in interest rates. The Governing Council refused to reduce rates, and I was proud to refer to the Adenauer precedent. Later, at the end of 2005, many governments warned against increasing interest rates. We did indeed increase rates, the ECB stuck to its mandate, and today nobody disputes the fact that our decisions were correct. At the time, however, we were under considerable pressure. We withstood that pressure. In most cases, criticism of independent central banks is sparked by restrictive decisions. Expansionary policies are rarely criticised. This shows that many pressure groups, as well as politicians, who often are under short-term pressure, don’t think in terms of the time horizons considered by central bankers. The ECB is independent. It does not allow any government, institution or lobby to influence its monetary policy decisions. The citizens of Germany and the rest of Europe can rely on us to continue to deliver price stability in the years to come. Our defence of our mandate will be just as resolute as it has been in the first 11 years of Monetary Union. A monetary policy that pursues short-term objectives is doomed to failure. However, this focus on the longer term means that those independent central banks also stand in contrast to the short-termism of the financial markets. The global financial crisis is also fundamentally a result of short-term thinking. Challenges arising from the financial crisis The handling of the financial crisis and its economic consequences has been a great challenge for us all. Governments and central banks have had to intervene on a massive scale in order to stabilise the financial system and the real economy. The monetary policy measures adopted by the Eurosystem have allowed inflation expectations to be kept stable even during the crisis. From the very beginning, our 
4 BIS Review 38/2010 interventions were designed in a way that allowed us to unwind them easily as soon as conditions improved. At no time did we lose sight of our price stability objective. Countries’ budget deficits have risen substantially on account of the crisis. Rising debt levels do not just bring with them the potential for greater conflict between fiscal and monetary policy. Above all, they also place a burden on the sustainability of public finances in the countries in question. It is therefore in the interests of each and every country to return to sound public finances as quickly as possible. In the current circumstances, where Europe faces pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all. The most important issue is that Europe’s policy-makers live up to their responsibilities. As I mentioned yesterday, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has always stressed the need to preserve and reinforce peer surveillance inside the euro area, to strictly apply the Treaty provisions and the Stability and Growth Pact, and to have the best functioning possible of the Commission and of the Eurogroup. Particularly as regards the government members of the Eurogroup, the ECB’s Governing Council has always considered that it was important that they would, as a college, live up to their very important responsibilities as regards fiscal policies, the monitoring of relative competitiveness and structural reforms. I am therefore pleased that the Heads of state and government of the euro area could work out a solution, implementing their earlier declaration to “take determined and coordinated action, if needed…”, which maintains the lead responsibility of European policy makers.  Monetary Union in Europe is far more than a monetary arrangement. As Hans Tietmeyer said many years ago, the Monetary Union is a community that shares a common destiny. And we should not forget that we are also a community of values. Price stability is the best contribution that central banks can make to the stability of the financial system. Price stability is even a necessary condition for financial stability. However, price stability is not a sufficient condition. Many people share responsibility for financial stability, and all must live up to that responsibility. The crisis has revealed weaknesses in the institutional framework. Thus far, it has not been sufficiently possible to encourage the Member States to implement policies that are in line with our benchmark. Fiscal policies, wage policies and structural policies must conform to our stability target of inflation of just under 2%. I am convinced that we will find ways of achieving this. Conclusion Before I finish, I should like to recount a short anecdote. Once, while Raymond Barre was Prime Minister [1976–1981], he asked me, given that I worked at the Treasury, whether I often travelled to Brussels. In that case, he said, I must meet Hans Tietmeyer. He said: “He is very influential, and he is a tough negotiator. If you have issues to discuss with him, good luck!” That was a considerable compliment. Germany and Europe have much to thank Hans Tietmeyer for. He was resolute in ensuring that the euro would be a stable currency. Today, after having had to cope with the worst financial crisis since World War II, we can say with confidence that the euro has been a stable currency since its inception and that the euro area is a stable community. As I said earlier, Hans Tietmeyer is the author of a book entitled “The euro challenge”. I am certain that the euro will be equal to that challenge. Thank you. 
BIS Review 38/2010 1 Glenn Stevens: Recent financial developments Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to ACI2010 49th World Congress, Sydney, 26 March 2010. *      *      * Welcome back to Sydney. The last time that this body met here was in 1992. At that time the Australian economy was in the early phase of a recovery from a deep recession. Pessimism about the future was deeply rooted. The financial system was under considerable strain. Unemployment was in double digits and still rising. Inflation had fallen significantly, but many people thought this was a temporary impact of the downturn. They thought that if we did get a recovery – and some despaired of that – we would return to our old bad habits of high inflation. People worried a lot about Australia’s substantial current account deficit. There were relatively few optimists. You might notice some of that sort of thinking today, in some other countries.  I imagine that among the participants of that 1992 meeting one could have gotten some pretty long odds against Australia having a long upswing, with inflation averaging “two point something”, surviving the financial crisis and ensuing global downturn with one of the mildest domestic downturns we have seen, and facing the future with a fair degree of confidence. This shows how hard it is to forecast, of course. But perhaps it also demonstrates that with time, effort, discipline, good policies and a bit of luck, economies can be returned to health and their citizens to prosperity.  Financial market recovery To that end, it is helpful that the global financial system is gradually recovering its poise, after a near-death experience eighteen months ago. Perhaps like a patient that has suffered an acute cardiac event, there has been some lasting tissue damage, but quick intervention avoided something much worse. A period of emergency life-support has been followed by a period of recuperation, with some ongoing medication, during which the patient has been able gradually to resume normal activities.  Certainly the functioning of money markets has improved substantially. Extreme counterparty risk aversion has abated and spreads of LIBOR rates to equivalent maturity OIS rates have come down to about the lowest levels since mid 2007. The dramatic expansion in the balance sheets of central banks in major economies has largely ended, though policy interest rates remain at 50-year lows.  Australia’s situation is more advanced in this regard. The expansion in the RBA’s balance sheet was unwound nearly a year ago and the policy rate has been increased somewhat, reflecting the very different circumstances facing the Australian economy. But we are not the only country seeking to manage the “return to normality”. An increasing number of countries outside those most directly affected by the crisis have begun this process – though the speed of adjustment naturally depends on national conditions.  Capital markets have also improved, with spreads to sovereign bond yields for private borrowers across most of the risk spectrum back to “pre-Lehman” levels, and for the best rated borrowers back almost to mid-2007 levels. They are not quite back to pre-crisis levels, but then, they probably should not have been at such low levels anyway. Similarly, spreads for emerging market sovereigns are well down from their peaks. In fact overall borrowing costs for quality corporates and emerging market sovereigns are similar to or slightly below what they were in 2006. This finer pricing is being accompanied by a gradual pick-up in debt issuance.  
2 BIS Review 38/2010 Appetite for risk has increased significantly since the end of 2008, albeit with some occasional setbacks. Of course we should expect that it would have increased, since September and October 2008 were characterised by sheer panic – there is no other word – and a flight from virtually any risk at all. Once the global financial system did not actually go over the precipice, there was going to be some re-appraisal. Hence, even as evidence continued to emerge in the first half of 2009 of the dramatic fall in demand for goods and services, share prices and spot commodity prices began to recover. Share prices are now about 60 per cent higher than the “priced for disaster” low point, while commodity price indexes have increased by a third. Some individual commodity prices have risen by much more.  Similarly, we have seen a preparedness to take foreign currency risk, and flows into emerging markets involving both foreign currency and credit risk have increased. Again, risk appetite has not returned to the heady days of the mid 2000s, but nor should it. Even the flows we have seen have begun to raise concerns among policy makers in some of the emerging countries about potential risks of asset market excesses and eventual capital flow reversal.  The banking sector For major financial institutions, the picture has also improved. The general decline in risk aversion has eased funding problems, and some countries have been able to terminate or scale back their government guarantee programs as banks are increasingly able to access term funding markets under their own names. Share prices for those financial institutions that are still privately owned have generally increased by more than the broader market. A number of large American and European banks that accepted public-sector capital injections during the crisis have moved to repay them.  The challenges that remain ahead for the banking system in major countries nonetheless remain considerable. The outlook for some of the remaining government ownership stakes remains unclear. While losses coming from write-downs of securities slowed some time back, losses are still occurring in lending books as a result of the normal effects of big recessions, not least in the area of commercial property. This will continue for a while. In addition, banks, particularly large internationally active banks with big trading operations, will require additional capital over time under proposed changes to global prudential standards.  There is a considerable contrast between that picture and the one for banks in most other countries. It is important to note that the majority of countries have not had a banking crisis as such. Everyone was affected by the seizing up of markets in late 2008, but most were not afflicted with the sorts of asset quality and capital issues that so bedevilled large US, UK and continental European banks. This in turn meant that once the panic had subsided, the banks in most countries were able to continue to carry out their functions – albeit under more difficult circumstances and facing much more subdued demand for credit, particularly from corporations.  Australia is a good example of this, though not the only one. The lowest rate of return on equity earned among the major banks here over the past two years was about 10 per cent in underlying terms; among smaller banks the lowest was 3 per cent. When markets for securitisation closed the major banks stepped into the gap by increasing their rate of housing lending, albeit at higher prices. These banks were able to support some business customers – again at a price – that in previous cycles they might have chosen to cut. The rate of provisioning for bad loans has stopped rising for several banks, and non-performing loans are likely to peak at a considerably lower share of loans than earlier expected. This general picture, even if not the exact numbers, would, I suspect, be replicated across much of Asia.  These differences in experience are an important backdrop for the international work on regulatory reforms. There is no question that there must be some significant reform. To use 
BIS Review 38/2010 3 the medical analogy again, the recovering patient is usually advised to consider some dietary and lifestyle changes, and perhaps to submit to some ongoing monitoring, in order to avoid further emergency procedures. These changes involve:   removing the scope for taking on excessive leverage via regulatory arbitrage;  making sure that adequate capital is held against risk that is being incurred;   ensuring better management of funding liquidity;   countering, to the extent possible, the inherent tendencies in both human nature and regulation to form assessments of risk in a pro-cyclical way;   and improving resolution processes to ensure orderly and rapid crisis management and to help manage the issue of “too-big-to-fail” institutions.  These are all very important goals. The Australian authorities support them. But as we have said before, the really serious problems were generated in a relatively small number of very large, internationally active banks. They did not stem from the thousands of other banks around the world which have not needed to be “bailed out” and whose capital resources have, in most cases, proved adequate to cover normal losses in a cyclical downswing. Hence it is important not to shackle unnecessarily the latter group in our efforts to constrain the relatively small number which caused much of the problem.  Challenges from sovereign debt Turning from banks to markets more generally, a recent development has been the increasing focus on sovereign debt and creditworthiness. The initial manifestation of this was late last year when Dubai World requested a six-month standstill agreement on its debt repayments.  More recently, the focus has been on Greece, after it was revealed that the Greek Government’s current borrowing requirement was much larger than had been previously disclosed. Greece is a small country – accounting for only half of one per cent of the world’s GDP. The significance of Greece is that it is a euro area country, which means two things. First, its adjustment to its predicament cannot involve currency depreciation (unless it were to leave the single currency). The only way it can grow out of the problem is by gaining competitiveness against other European economies via domestic deflation, which will be a difficult and lengthy process. A very large fiscal consolidation is an unavoidable part of this path. Second, the euro area has an interest in this effort succeeding, which is why there has been intense discussion about whether, and in what form, European assistance might be forthcoming. Any assistance would of course have to pass the test of credibility more generally in Europe, and would need to be applicable under similar terms to other euro area countries if needed. This is obviously a difficult problem, on which the policymakers concerned are continuing to work.  Perhaps the broader significance is that the difficulties facing Greece, while unusually stark, are a reminder of the challenges facing many governments in Europe, and for that matter the United States and Britain, over the long haul. Ratios of debt to GDP are rising quite significantly in all these cases. There are several reasons.  The first is the size of the recessions being experienced, which obviously reduces revenues and adds to some categories of spending – the so-called “automatic stabilisers”. This effect is relatively larger in some European countries but it occurs everywhere to some extent.  The second factor is the discretionary budgetary decisions aimed at stimulating demand and injecting capital into banks. In the circumstances, the former was understandable; the latter was unavoidable.  
4 BIS Review 38/2010 The “automatic stabilisers” will presumably “automatically” move budget positions in the right direction as economies recover. The costs of stimulus and bank rescue measures, while one-off in nature, do leave debt permanently higher. But without such measures, economies might have suffered much deeper downturns and so the extent of budget deterioration could have been much greater, itself leaving an even bigger debt legacy.  If that was the end of the story, we would not want to get too worked-up over debt ratios. Unfortunately, though, there is more to the story.  For several important countries there was a trend increase in debt-to-GDP ratios going on before the crisis occurred. For the domestic audience, let me be clear that Australia has been a conspicuous exception. Particularly in mainland Europe, the pattern has tended to be for debt ratios to rise quickly in periods of recession, then to stabilise for some years, before rising again in the next recession. No doubt multiple factors are at work but the interaction of changing demographics and generous welfare, health and retirement systems is prominent. The same factors also work, other things equal, to lessen future potential economic growth.  It is certainly not unprecedented for countries to have debt stocks much larger than their annual GDPs. This has usually been seen when they faced the requirements of fighting wars. Those ratios subsequently came down over time. But the situation now is different. The decline in debt ratios seen after the Second World War, for example, driven by rapid growth in output as population expanded and productivity surged, will not easily be repeated in many of the major countries.  It is these more deep-seated trends, which were in place before the crisis, that are really the greater cause for concern; the crisis has brought them more sharply into focus. The demographic drivers will continue for the foreseeable future, while the unwillingness or inability to tackle the structural trends in earlier “good times” has significantly reduced future flexibility.  So a number of advanced industrial countries face some difficult fiscal decisions over the years ahead. At some point, significant discretionary tightening will be required. Of course policymakers need to get recoveries well entrenched, which is why many observers warn against attempting an early fiscal consolidation. But unless a credible path to fiscal sustainability can also be set out, growth could easily be stunted by rising risk premia built into interest rates as markets worry about long-run solvency. This is not happening as yet; long-term rates in many of the major advanced countries remain quite low. That provides a window within which to plan the eventual consolidation. Since markets can be fickle and things can change, governments will surely want to use the window.  Economic recovery In the mean time differences persist in the pace of economic recovery across regions. In the United States growth spurred by a swing in the inventory cycle is thought to have marked the turning point in the second half of 2009, but most observers still expect only moderate growth this year. In Europe, the momentum of the recovery has been less certain. In both cases the old forecasting cliché about uncertainty applies in spades.  In contrast, it is apparent that the letter “v” is a reasonable description of the trajectory, to date, of important emerging countries like China, India, Brazil and a number of smaller east Asian countries. We should expect to see some moderation in the pace of growth of production in some of these cases this year. This is usually the case in “v-shaped” recoveries, since the initial pace of expansion is considerably higher than the long run sustainable growth rate.  The question of what happens to demand in these countries is of course distinct from that of what happens to production. Full employment in parts of the emerging world will probably be 
BIS Review 38/2010 5 reached before full employment in North America or Europe. Productive capacity therefore would remain to meet further demand from the emerging world, via imports of goods and services from the “old world”. That is, emerging Asia and some other parts of the world could see their living standards rise a bit faster than the increase in their own productivity, for a time, if they were prepared to meet some demand through imports. Facilitating this most efficiently would of course involve, among other things, allowing exchange rates to change.  The alternative approach would be to seek to slow growth in demand in the emerging world as production there approaches full capacity, so as to maintain internal balance at a given set of exchange rates. But that would leave unused capacity in the industrial countries and emerging world living standards lower than they could be. These are polar cases – it would of course be open to policymakers to steer some path in between.  Among Asian policy makers many factors go into thinking about exchange rates and trade and capital flows. They have a degree of suspicion of rapid capital flows and large movements in exchange rates, which is understandable after the experiences of the late 1990s. It is also understandable that the smaller economies, some of which are extremely open, with trade shares of more than 100 per cent of GDP, do not wish to see volatile exchange rates because it is disruptive for their economies. Moreover, the issue goes well beyond just exchange rates per se; it involves saving and investment patterns, and national policy approaches to growth, the speed with which these can be adjusted and so on. The point, nonetheless, is that the current and prospective differences in economic circumstances between significant parts of the world are likely to put strains on the relative settings of macroeconomic policies and exchange rate arrangements. This will need careful management, by all concerned, over the next few years.  Conclusion The stabilisation of financial markets and banking systems over the past year or more is a welcome development for all of us. There are still difficulties to overcome for financial institutions in some key countries as a result of the depth of recessions, and these will be the subject of attention over the coming year. Looking ahead, the differences in the speed of economic recovery are starting to present challenges of their own, showing up as they do in capital flows, asset valuations and exchange rates. When we add to all that the looming long-term requirement for fiscal consolidation in a number of major countries, there is plenty for markets and policy makers alike to think about.  I’m sure your conference will take up these issues with great energy. I wish you every success in doing so.  
BIS Review 38/2010 1 Daniel K Tarullo: Lessons from the crisis stress tests Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Board International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, Washington DC, 26 March 2010. *      *      * Effective responses to dire situations often require bold actions that would be unthinkable in calmer times. So it was in the financial crisis, when central banks undertook extraordinary monetary policy measures and governments made major financial firms wards of the state. Yet sometimes a crisis also accelerates adoption of policies and practices that might beneficially have been implemented beforehand and then are sensibly continued after the crisis has passed. This evening I will examine an instance of this latter phenomenon, as defined by the Federal Reserve’s experience with comprehensive stress testing of major financial institutions during the crisis. The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was fashioned in early 2009 as a key element of a crucial plan to stabilize the U.S. financial system. The stress tests, as they have been popularly called, required development on the fly, and under enormous pressure, of ideas that academics and supervisors had been considering for some time. After describing the concept, design, and implementation of last year’s tests, I will explain how our experience has helped prompt major changes in Federal Reserve supervision of the nation’s largest financial institutions. Then I will discuss how this experience has stimulated debate over the merits of publicly releasing supervisory information.1 Origins and execution of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program By February 2009, many steps had already been taken to restore the health of, and confidence in, U.S. banks. The U.S. Treasury had injected capital into banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had expanded guarantees for bank liabilities under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. And the Federal Reserve had established a number of lending programs to provide liquidity to financial institutions in addition to its aggressive monetary policy actions. Despite these actions, a great deal of uncertainty remained about future bank losses and solvency, which was only increased by the rapidly deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in early 2009. The Treasury determined that confidence could best be restored by making additional capital available to banks that were unable to raise from private sources the amounts necessary for them to continue to function as effective financial intermediaries even if economic conditions worsened appreciably. To evaluate how much capital individual institutions might require, U.S. bank supervisors, led by the Federal Reserve, undertook a stringent, forward-looking assessment of prospective losses and revenues – a stress test – for the 19 largest U.S. banks. Using TARP funds, the Treasury established the Capital Assistance Program (CAP) to provide any needed capital. Let me summarize the mechanics of the stress tests. First, in February 2009, each of the SCAP banks was asked to perform a capital-adequacy stress test under two economic scenarios – baseline and more adverse – using specified assumptions for gross domestic product (GDP) growth, unemployment, and house prices. The baseline scenario reflected the consensus expectation among professional forecasters on the depth and duration of the                                                  1  The views expressed in these remarks are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors. 
2 BIS Review 38/2010 recession. The more adverse scenario was designed to be severe but plausible, with a probability of roughly 10 to 15 percent that each of the macroeconomic variables could be worse than specified. The banks were asked to provide projections of losses and revenues under the two scenarios. Losses were to be projected over a two-year horizon for at least 12 separate categories of loans and a few other asset classes, using year-end 2008 financial statement data as a starting point. To guide the banks, supervisors provided indicative loss-rate ranges for the system as a whole, derived from both analysis of historical loss experience at large banks and quantitative models relating loan performance to macroeconomic variables. Banks were informed that loss estimates below the indicative range would be closely scrutinized. Second, the supervisory teams evaluated the banks’ estimates to identify methodological weaknesses, missing information, overly optimistic assumptions, and other problems. Examiners had detailed conversations with bank managers, which led to numerous modifications of the banks’ submissions. Supervisors then made judgmental adjustments to the banks’ loss and revenue estimates based on sensitivity analyses performed by the firms, comparative analysis across the firms, and the supervisors’ own judgments. Third, the supervisors supplemented these judgmental assessments with objective, model-based estimates for losses and revenues that could be applied on a consistent basis across firms. Each participating institution was asked to supply, in a standardized format, detailed information that supervisors could use to estimate losses and revenues, such as details about loan characteristics. These data allowed supervisors to make consistent estimates using independently constructed models. Finally, supervisors systematically incorporated all of these inputs into loss, revenue, and reserve estimates for each institution. These estimates were combined with information on existing reserves and capital to project capital buffers that the banks would need under the two scenarios. As you know, unlike other countries that conducted stress exercises, we took the highly unusual step of publicly reporting the findings of the SCAP, including the capital needs and loss estimates for each of the 19 banks.2 This departure from the standard practice of keeping examination information confidential was based on the belief that greater transparency of the process and findings would help restore confidence in U.S. banks at a time of great uncertainty. Supervisors released the methodology and assumptions underlying the stress test first and then, two weeks later, the results for individual institutions. The results showed that under the more adverse scenario, 10 of the 19 SCAP banks would need to raise a total of $75 billion in capital in order to have the capital buffers that were targeted under the SCAP – Tier 1 capital in excess of 6 percent of risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 Common capital in excess of 4 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of the two-year horizon. The merits of publicly releasing firm-specific SCAP results were much debated within the Federal Reserve. In particular, some feared that weaker banks might be significantly harmed by the disclosures. In the end, though, market participants vindicated our decision. They appeared to be reassured for three reasons. First, the results were deemed credible by most market participants, owing in part to the release of details about our assumptions and methods, as well as the variation in assessment of the banks. Second, the results were released at a time when uncertainty about bank conditions was very high, and some market participants feared the worst. That is, perceptions of tail risk were very high, and the SCAP results helped reassure market participants that under a severe but plausible scenario, the capital needs of the largest U.S. banks were manageable. Third, the Treasury stood ready to                                                  2  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC Release Results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program,” press release, May 7. 
BIS Review 38/2010 3 make capital available to any SCAP bank with capital needs through the CAP if they were unable to raise private capital. In retrospect, it is clear that the public release of the SCAP results played an important role in stabilizing the financial system, as has our supervisory follow-up on improving capital levels. By November 2009, the 10 banks that required additional capital had increased their Tier 1 Common equity by more than $77 billion, primarily by issuing new common equity, converting existing preferred equity to common equity, and selling businesses or portfolios of assets. None of the SCAP banks received CAP funds.3 Many observers initially criticized the stress tests as overly optimistic. On the one hand, they noted that GDP growth was weaker and unemployment higher in 2009 than projected in the more adverse scenario. On the other hand, house prices did not fall as much as assumed under the more adverse scenario. As of the end of 2009, actual losses at the 19 banks were less than one-half of the two-year loss estimates under the more adverse SCAP scenario, and actual revenues were more than one-half of the two-year revenue estimates. Nevertheless, there is wide variation across the firms, and it is too soon to tell whether firms will perform better over the full two years than the SCAP estimates. The lessons of the SCAP As I suggested at the outset of my remarks, I doubt that anything as ambitious as the SCAP would have been tried – at least as soon as it was – but for the exigencies of the financial crisis. Yet the approach we took in the SCAP was informed by discussions that had been taking place among supervisors and academics for some time. Not surprisingly, against the backdrop of the crisis, the SCAP experience elaborated and confirmed principles that had been advocated internally by some supervisors, but that had not been broadly incorporated into the practice of regulatory agencies. First, whether conducted by banks or supervisors, stress tests must consider severe but plausible scenarios, including low probability events with potentially highly adverse effects. In the period leading up to the crisis – characterized by strong profits, excess liquidity, and low credit losses – too many banks and regulators were skeptical of the possibility of a rapid and severe deterioration such as ultimately occurred in the U.S. housing, mortgage, and short-term funding markets. If the crisis taught us anything, it is that we must test to the tail, not to the mode. A related point is that a stress test will be most useful if applied to the full range of credit and trading exposures. Second, good management-information systems are critical to the ability of firms to manage their risks. Assessing risk exposures across an entire organization is essential to understanding the potential effect of correlated risk exposures that may reside in distinct business lines as well as different legal entities and regulatory jurisdictions. Yet during the SCAP, many of the banks were unable to quickly and consistently consolidate risk exposures across products, business lines, legal entities, and geographies. It does little good to run a stress test, even one using a sophisticated quantitative model, if it does not effectively capture all relevant exposures because the bank’s information systems are poorly managed or integrated. Third, the SCAP highlighted the importance of having multiple inputs into the risk-assessment process. It was critical to have, and use, the best available data. But it was equally important not to become a slave to any one model or method of estimating losses. It was precisely the combination of rigorous, data-driven analyses and considered judgment                                                  3  GMAC did receive a capital injection from the Treasury through the TARP’s Automotive Industry Financing Program. 
4 BIS Review 38/2010 that made the stress test successful. The interactive and iterative nature of the process helped refine each method of assessment. Fourth, the SCAP underscored the importance of both horizontal and macroprudential perspectives in supervising banking organizations. During the SCAP, simultaneous, consistent, and comparative cross-firm assessments allowed a broader analysis of risks, easier identification of outliers, and better evaluation of individual firm estimates. Because SCAP banks held the majority of U.S. banking assets, it also allowed for a better understanding of interrelationships and systemic risks. Turning now to how the SCAP experience has informed our supervisory policies, I think its effects are best understood in the overall context of the reforms motivated by the financial crisis. Like regulators around the world, we are developing and implementing improvements in capital and other prudential rules. The Congress is considering legislative proposals to enhance market discipline through such means as a special resolution mechanism for large financial firms and to affect the structure of the financial services industry through such measures as the Volcker rule and limitations on acquisitions by systemically important firms. These three modes of reform – rules, market discipline, and structural measures – must be complemented by more-effective supervisory oversight, particularly of the largest, most complex financial institutions. To this end, the Federal Reserve is now implementing a more closely coordinated supervisory system in which a cross-firm, horizontal perspective is an organizing supervisory principle. We will concentrate on all activities within the holding companies that can create risk to the firm and the financial system, not just those that increase risk for insured depository institutions. An essential component of this new system will be a quantitative surveillance mechanism for large, complex financial organizations that will combine a more macroprudential, multidisciplinary approach with the horizontal perspective. Quantitative surveillance will use supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, and market-based indicators to identify developing strains and imbalances that may affect multiple institutions, as well as emerging risks to specific firms. Periodic forward-looking scenario analyses will enhance our understanding of the potential effects of adverse changes in the operating environment on individual firms and on the system as a whole. In fact, I believe that the most useful steps toward creating a practical, macroprudential supervisory perspective will be those that connect the firm-specific information and insight gained from traditional microprudential supervision to analysis of systemwide developments and emerging stresses. Here, precisely, is where our SCAP experience has helped lead the way. The question of transparency  One important element of the SCAP that has not yet been incorporated into our ongoing supervisory plans is the public disclosure of stress test information. I think this issue deserves consideration. As I recently testified, access to higher-quality and more-timely information about financial products, firms, and markets is necessary for effective supervision.4 Making data public – to the degree consistent with protecting firm-specific proprietary information – would have additional benefits. In the specific context of greater transparency in supervisory stress tests, I see at least two. First, the release of details about assumptions, methods, and conclusions would expose the supervisory approach to greater outside scrutiny and discussion. Sometimes those                                                  4  Daniel K. Tarullo (2010), “Equipping Financial Regulators with the Tools Necessary to Monitor Systemic Risk,” statement before the Subcommittee on Security and International Trade and Finance, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, February 12. 
BIS Review 38/2010 5 discussions will help us improve our assumptions or methodology. At other times disclosure might reassure investors about the quality of the tests. Either way, the public’s reaction to our assumptions and methods would be useful. Second, because loan portfolios are inherently difficult to value without a great deal of detailed information, increased transparency could be an important addition to the information available to investors and counterparties of the largest institutions. If, as I believe, progress on the too-big-to-fail problem is integral to an effective reform of financial regulation, we must enhance market discipline. The market discipline made possible by such means as special resolution mechanisms and contingent capital will be most effective if market participants have adequate information with which to make informed judgments about the banks. There are, to be sure, countervailing concerns. In more normal economic times, when market participants are not fearing the worst and when banks do not have access to government capital injections as a backstop, the revelation that some major banks may have capital needs under a stress scenario might be unnecessarily destabilizing. This possibility would be increased if market participants attached undue weight to specific capital or loss numbers released by the government. In practical terms, there are several ways we might increase transparency. One, of course, would be to follow the SCAP precedent, with periodic release of detailed information about the assumptions, methods, and results of a cross-firm, horizontal, forward-looking exercise, including firm-specific outcomes. This approach would probably maximize both the potential benefits and potential risks. Note, however, that the possibility of a destabilizing market reaction may be lower if such information is released frequently, as major unpleasant surprises would be less likely with frequent, detailed disclosures. Of course, significant changes in the economic environment might still lead to unpleasant surprises when the results are released.5 A second option would be to provide details about the assumptions and methods supervisors employed in the stress tests but withhold public release of results for individual banks. This practice could be coupled with a requirement for more systematic, timely, and consistent disclosure by the largest banks of information on material firmwide risk positions and exposures, funding and liquidity profiles, operating performance, and other measures. Like the first approach, this option would have the benefit of opening supervisors’ methods to discussion. By increasing the disclosure of banks’ risk exposures, this approach would also enhance market discipline, as market participants could make their own forward-looking assessments of banks’ conditions. However, some benefit would be lost, since the information from individual banks would not have been standardized or verified by regulators. Concomitantly, while the risk of an overreaction to the release of information would still exist, there would be no single number on which market participants could focus. A third possibility would be to have supervisors release aggregate results of their horizontal, forward-looking assessments, along with details about their assumptions and methods, without requiring additional disclosure by firms. This approach could still confer considerable benefits by providing information to the public about the overall condition of the banking system as well as about supervisory methods. It has, in fact, been applied by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which conducted a special bank inspection in 2002 and 2003, when Japanese banks were still recovering from a crisis. The FSA publicly released aggregate results showing the differences between the banks’ and the FSA’s assessments of loan quality, which showed that the FSA’s assessments were more stringent than the banks’. Many of the major banks subsequently increased their loan loss reserves, and the                                                  5  In addition, it would be important to assure that the routine release of selected supervisory information did not undermine our ability to maintain the confidentiality of other supervisory information. 
6 BIS Review 38/2010 inspections appeared to increase confidence in the banking system. Of course, the informational benefit to market participants could be substantially diluted if they are unable to distinguish the conditions of individual firms as reflected in the aggregate numbers. Conclusion To conclude, you should now have a sense of the degree to which our experience with SCAP experience has informed changes in our supervision of large institutions as part of the broader enterprise of regulatory reform. As to the issue of stress test transparency, I look forward to hearing how others assess the merits of the alternative approaches I have described and, of course, any new ideas. 
BIS Review 37/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Introductory statement before the Plenary of the European Parliament Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, before the Plenary of the European Parliament, Brussels, 25 March 2010. *      *      * Introduction  Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, ich freue mich, anlässlich der Debatte zur Entschließung über den Jahresbericht 2008 der Europäischen Zentralbank heute bei Ihnen zu sein.  Aufgrund der Parlamentswahlen im vergangen Jahr hat sich die diesjährige Debatte deutlich verschoben.  Aber dies eröffnet mir die Möglichkeit, die wesentlichen Entwicklungen im letzten Jahr vor der neu gewählten Plenarversammlung zu erörtern, und am Ende auch auf die aktuelle Lage einzugehen.  Comme vous le savez, la BCE se félicite des relations très étroites avec le Parlement, qui vont bien au-delà des obligations prévues par le Traité. Nous avons établi, au fil des années, un dialogue très fructueux.  Aujourd’hui, dans mon exposé, je passerai brièvement en revue les évolutions économiques observées en 2009 et les mesures de politique monétaire prises par la BCE. Ensuite, j’aborderai quelques points soulevés dans votre proposition de résolution et je terminerai par quelques remarques sur la situation actuelle.  1. Economic developments and monetary policy over the past year So what have been the key developments in the economy and in monetary policy over the past year?  In 2009, the European Central Bank was operating in an environment that future economic historians are likely to describe as the most difficult one for advanced economies since the Second World War.  Following the profound intensification of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the year 2009 started with a continued synchronised fall in economic activity worldwide.  Until around April last year, economic activity was declining, month after month, faster than any model had predicted. That is why we have often characterised what we were experiencing as a “free fall” in economic activity.  The immediate policy action taken by central banks, governments and Parliaments across the world stopped this “free fall” and laid the foundations for a gradual recovery in Europe and elsewhere over the course of 2009. I would venture to say that if central banks, governments and Parliaments around the world had not acted as resolutely as they did, it could have become the most difficult episode for advanced economies since the First World War. The ECB was in the vanguard of the world’s central banks. We have confirmed our capability to take bold and timely action.  
2 BIS Review 37/2010 Our “trademark”, which was vital for maintaining confidence, has been the ability to take the necessary immediate and exceptional decisions whilst, at the same time, remaining inflexibly attached to our primary objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term.  The ECB’s medium-term orientation in its interest rate policy and in the design of non-standard measures has helped to contain the emergence of both deflationary and inflationary risks.  Inflation expectations remained well anchored throughout the crisis, while we provided essential support to the real economy through the banking system and the financial markets. Some of the most important non-standard measures that we used were an unlimited provision of liquidity to banks, an extension of operations for periods of up to one year and a moderate, yet highly effective purchase programme for covered bank bonds, which reactivated this segment of the bank funding market. Overall, our non-standard monetary policy measures – which are known collectively as “enhanced credit support” – have served the euro area economy well.  They have supported the functioning of the money market, contributed to improving financing conditions and allowed for a better flow of credit to the real economy than could have been achieved through interest rate reductions alone. By and large, banks have been passing on the sharply lower key ECB interest rates to households and businesses.  Designing a timely exit strategy from our non-standard measures was a central part of the ECB’s response to the crisis. In September last year, we set out our overall strategy. In December, we decided on its implementation.  The guiding principle is that to the extent that the situation returns to normal, keeping such measures in place for longer than required risks changing the behaviour of financial market participants in an undesirable manner.  We do not wish to breed dependency.  Thus, in December 2009, we began to gradually phase out some of our extraordinary liquidity measures, taking account of improvements in financial markets. In particular, we scaled back the number, frequency and maturity of longer-term refinancing operations.  But we have committed to maintaining fully accommodating liquidity support to the euro area banking system until at least October this year. The Governing Council is of the opinion that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and that the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations bodes well for price stability in the medium term.  2. Specific issues raised in the European Parliament’s draft resolution Let me now turn to some of the issues you raise in your draft resolution. On the issues of accountability and transparency, we very much appreciate the regular dialogue with the European Parliament and the constructive spirit with which this exchange is conducted.  I therefore welcome the ECON Committee’s repeated support for our quarterly monetary dialogue. An independent institution like the ECB, which is accountable to the European people, has to be in close contact with their elected representatives.  We consider the ECB to be one of the world’s most transparent central banks. Our practice of holding a press conference immediately after the Governing Council meeting on monetary policy each month remains a pioneering initiative that has not yet been replicated by our major sister institutions. With the publication of our comprehensive Introductory Statement in real-time, we explain policy decisions and their underlying rationale.  
BIS Review 37/2010 3 During the crisis, we have further intensified our communication efforts and thereby helped to smooth financial market reactions, to build confidence and to lay the foundations for recovery.  You also requested the views of the ECB on the establishment of a clearing house for instruments such as credit default swaps (CDSs) within the euro area. I would like to say that the robustness of euro-denominated CDS markets is of direct relevance for the Eurosystem as regards control over its currency and financial stability in the euro area.  Central counterparty clearing is very important not only for delivering transparency, but also for diversifying and sharing risk exposures and reducing the incentives to take excessive risks. Certain financial instruments, which were introduced for hedging, should not be misused for speculation. Regulators should be able to undertake effective investigations into possible improper conduct.  3. The outlook for EMU during challenging times  Mr President, honourable members of the European Parliament, An economic recovery is in progress, but this does not mean that the crisis is over.  For one thing, we know that the pace of recovery will be uneven and we cannot rule out setbacks.  For another, we are still facing numerous challenges regarding the reform of our financial system. Finance must play a constructive role, and not a destructive one, in our economies.  The litmus test for a constructive role is that finance serves the real economy. To ensure such a role, we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further. Thus far, a great deal of attention has been focused on the banking sector. But effective reforms also have to look very closely at non-bank financial institutions and at the set-up and functioning of financial markets.  Financial markets are not always efficient.  They are not always deep and liquid. Nor do they always represent a fair competition of views and positions. Often, specific market segments can be oligopolistic, dominated by a few large players. In such markets, the views of powerful players can trigger trends that move valuations way out of line with fundamentals.  We have to devise mechanisms and incentives to ensure that finance does not spiral out of control in the destructive way that it did just prior to the crisis.  We have to contain systemic disruptions that lead to economic hardship for the people of Europe. Setting up the European Systemic Risk Board, legislation for which is currently being considered by the Parliament, is part of the correct response to this challenge.  There are other challenges facing the European economy, and these are associated with public finances and sovereign financial health. Within Europe’s economic and monetary union, there is a clear allocation of responsibilities.  With respect to that allocation of responsibilities, everyone can count on the commitment of the ECB to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole over the medium term.  Meanwhile, we have not only this commitment, but we also have a track record of nearly a dozen years.  Based on our latest staff macroeconomic projections for this year, the average annual inflation rate in the first 12 years of the euro is likely to stand at around 1.95%. That is in line with our definition of price stability: “below 2%, but close to 2%”. The ECB’s commitment, strategy and track record are consistent.  
4 BIS Review 37/2010 But the smooth functioning of Europe’s economic and monetary union cannot rest on a single pillar. EMU rests on two pillars, the monetary and the economic one. Policy-makers at the national level must likewise contribute to the success and stability of EMU and they need to deliver policies that are in line with its principles. In particular, they must keep public finances sound and their economies competitive.  In the current circumstances, where Europe faces further pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all. Whatever direction the upcoming decisions regarding the current situation may take, the most important issue is that Europe’s policy-makers live up to their responsibilities.  Monetary Union in Europe is far more than a monetary arrangement. It is a union of shared destiny.  Wir teilen ein gemeinsames Schicksal. Nous partageons un destin commun. Condividiamo un destino commune. Compartimos un destino común.  This destiny is for our common good, and it is the vision of our founding fathers. Monetary Union is not a matter of convenience. It is part of an overarching process of advancing the integration of the people in Europe that began after the Second World War.  It received a new impetus with the fall of the iron curtain. Europe has seized the opportunity to unite people of sovereign nations in a union of prosperity, stability and values. I am, of course, aware of the great breadth of discussions about underlying decisions and actions  – both within Europe and outside Europe. Many people are questioning the direction in which we as European citizens, European nations and European policy-makers are going. In my view, this discussion is under way not because we have failed – it is because we have been successful. Europe has succeeded in virtually everything it had wanted to achieve. Uniting a continent in which many capital cities have, at diverse points in history, been capitals of the world is an achievement that is often overlooked.  I believe we often play this achievement down. And we are often too quick to criticise our institutions and processes. But they have generally worked well, even in the most difficult times. During the financial crisis, for example, European institutions and processes have remained effective. We have avoided on this side of the Atlantic dramatic events that could have triggered a new intensification of the crisis, which started in the U.S. in September 2008. And we have not had any mishap with the passing in any of our numerous Parliaments of a financial support package. Europe is functioning and it is delivering what its citizens need.  Through our Economic and Monetary Union, we have achieved a considerable degree of cohesion and stability – and we must protect that achievement. It is within this context that I appreciate the commitment of euro area Member States, made on the occasion of the last European Council meeting, to take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area. Let me also take advantage of my presence in front of the European Parliament to lay out what I already mentioned in the hearing before the Economic and Monetary Committee on Monday. It is the intention of the ECB’s Governing Council to keep the minimum credit threshold in the collateral framework at investment grade level (BBB–) beyond the end of 2010. In parallel, we would introduce, as of January 2011, a graded haircut schedule, which will continue to adequately protect the Eurosystem. I will provide the technical details when reporting on the Governing Council decisions of our next meeting on 8 April.  
BIS Review 37/2010 5 Conclusion The introduction of the single currency just over a decade ago represents the greatest achievement in the history of European integration to date – a process that has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe. The global financial crisis has brought fresh challenges to which we in Europe have all risen. Our Monetary Union and our very close ties, inside the single market, with all EU Member States’ economies have prevented the crisis from being compounded by currency crises, as in the traumatic experiences of the early 1990s.  Today, Europe faces further pivotal decisions. Our common task is to ensure continued peace and prosperity, to make our union an even more attractive place to live and work in.  For this purpose, we need strengthened surveillance and strengthened cooperation. We also need to revive the sense of common purpose, the shared ideals that motivated our founding fathers. Their endeavour was visionary and all what we see in today’s world confirms their lucidity. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 37/2010 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: East African integration as a solution to economic growth and employment generation Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, on the occasion of a public lecture, Kenyatta University, Nairobi, 16 March 2010. *      *      * The Chairman of Council; The Vice-Chancellor; Deputy Vice-Chancellors; Members of the entire University Community; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a pleasure and honour for me to address this distinguished audience on a very topical and timely issue of EAC integration as a solution to economic growth and employment generation for Kenya and the EAC region. I wish to focus my talk on domestic and regional policy initiatives and how they impact on growth, and more specifically on the employment situation in Kenya. May I start by pointing out that unemployment reflects the inability of economic activity to absorb labour or human resource at different levels. When we talk of economic activity, we mean growth. It allows economic opportunities to emerge. The most important one; investment opportunities that increase the demand for human capital. So employment is a derived demand, from the demands on economic activity and increased investment. But how does regional integration improve economic activity (growth) for member countries and so increase labour absorption – employment? This is the question we need to focus our attention on. Let me try some quick avenues: 1. EAC will provide a wider market – this will induce firms’ production expansion in size and product lines – to satisfy a wider market. 2. A larger market requires a larger investment outlay. 3. A larger market diversifies the sources of income flows. 4. Financial services to cover the region will have to adjust to a higher platform: for instance, Kenyan banks are currently expanding to the region in a significant way. The same applies to a number of other sectors such as retail services as evident with the expansion of Nakumatt and Uchumi retail shops to the region. 5. Larger demands for regional infrastructure to facilitate trade and production. The list can be long and depends on where one starts, but at the end, labour demand is derived demand from all of these economic activities. To develop this topic on Kenya, I wish to develop three arguments on Kenya’s case: First, the policy solutions, their evolution and shocks; It is often good to start from a perspective that policies, once implemented, will work and even when shocks hit the economy, the economy will return to its potential. How long it takes to return to its potential is determined by how pervasive and persistent shocks were. Having said that, the blue print of growth and employment creation was laid out by the NARC Government – “Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation” which covered the period  2003–2007. This bore fruit and the economy picked up from a low of 0.5 percent annual growth in 2002 to 6.3 percent in 2006 to 7.1 percent in 2007. This saw the number of new 
2 BIS Review 37/2010 jobs created reaching 506.5 thousand, 488.4 thousand, 485.5 thousand, 467.3 thousand in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 respectively. The results of this blue print of policy paradigm show that success will always generate success. Once policies are followed to the paper, they will generate the desired results. But then external and internal shocks hit the economy in 2008 stepped in. However, the economy is on the recovery path and it was expected to grow by about 2.1 percent in 2009 and at between 3 and 4.5 percent in 2010 and by over 5 percent in subsequent years. It is important perhaps to explain why in times of shocks, growth, investment and even economic decisions are affected and even affect other outcomes like consumption and employment. Three examples include: 1. At the individual level optimizing welfare under uncertainty. 2. Irreversibility of fixed investment decisions. 3. Informal sector expansion as a disequilibrium queuing model of employment. These are short-run and should not condemn us to a low equilibrium trap. Second, the EAC Common Market and its potential for employment.  In general, most countries in Africa are forming regional economic integration arrangements in order to; secure access to larger markets and enhance trade flows and in the process attract the much needed foreign direct investments; lower trade costs among neighbours; leverage or lock in domestic reforms; create a framework for regional cooperation and resource pooling; increase their bargaining power and political cohesion.  Economic integration has the potential for economic growth; to create wealth; improve labour and social conditions and result in a better division of labour between countries based on comparative advantage. Exploiting relative comparative advantage of each integrating member country enhances the region’s efficiency in production, increasing output and boosting economic growth of each member country.  Regional integration, uniformity of policy and common goals will act as an agency of restraint and cushion the external shocks in some cases.  The EAC brings together nationals of five countries namely, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. In 2008, the five countries had a combined population of 126.6 million people and a nominal GDP of USD73 billion (based on EAC Facts and Figures Report, 2009). In the same year, Kenya’s GDP stood at USD26.9 billion, that is 37 percent of the EAC total. It is the dominant economy in the bloc. This enlarged market means potential for increased free trade among members. Free trade is expected to lead to rapid expansion of trade and output, which in turn is expected to lead to demand for further investment, employment and GDP growth. These gains result from the dynamic effects of a Common Market, which have been shown to overshadow the static effects, that is, trade creation, trade diversion and terms of trade effects. The dynamic effects, which are cumulative in nature lead to growth. Indeed, the dynamic effects of a Common Market are often described as the long-run consequences for the economic growth of member countries as a consequence of increased market size and exploitation of economies of scale, increased competition, learning by doing and increased investment. Also, the stronger the potential economies of scale are, and the more rapid the autonomous productivity advantages, the more likely the economic integration will lead to growth. Thus, the contribution of the EAC Common Market to economic growth and employment will be greater if the economies of scale are possible by increased market size, takes place pari passu with learning by doing. 
BIS Review 37/2010 3  However, higher levels of economic integration that would ensure such benefits are realized require heavy infrastructural investments in the region. With this realization, the EAC Development Strategy sets out the priority programmes for the region focusing on among others, cooperation in infrastructure development. An efficient infrastructure development mainly for EAC in terms of roads and railway interconnectivity has the potential to increase from 3.7 million tonnes in 2007 to over 16 million tonnes by 2030, at an annual rate of growth of 6.7 percent, according to a study on the EAC Railways Master Plan. Current EAC efforts to develop regional infrastructures are complemented at the continental level by such initiatives as the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (ICA), established in 2005 and mandated to support and promote increased investment in infrastructure in Africa from both public and private sources. In addition, with the implementation of the EAC Common Market Protocol, regional infrastructural projects will be well defined.  Ladies and Gentlemen, it is worth noting that the overriding rationale for regional integration is development, with all the benefits that come with it. Theoretically, integration fosters growth through different channels such as increasing innovation through economies of scale and through technological spillovers and elimination of replication in research and development. Empirically, integration gives access to a larger market, more stock of technology and knowledge and therefore, more innovations and growth. Furthermore, expanded markets and increased productivity following integration, triggers increasing returns in the research and development sectors due to the implied scale effects. All these channels have important implications on employment generation and economic growth for the integrating economies.  The overriding objective of the EAC Common Market is to widen and deepen cooperation among partner states in both economic and social fields for the benefit of the citizens of the member states. This is beyond what literature terms as “beg thy neighbour” effects. The Common Market Protocol provides for the free movement of goods, persons, labour, services and capital within the region as well as the right of establishment and the right of residence.  The Common Market will unlock many other benefits among East African citizens. Currently, efforts are underway to move to the next level of economic integration, after the completion of a Study by the European Central Bank consultants on the East African Monetary Union (EAMU). The study has explored among other things the current preparedness for a Monetary Union, institutional frameworks and structure for an EAMU, design of a protocol on the EAMU to be negotiated by partner states, and proposals for monitoring and enforcing macroeconomic convergence in the region.  Ladies and Gentlemen, all these integration endeavours will create employment opportunities. I will emphasize on employment opportunities because it is a dynamic concept that focuses on gainful employment and space to utilize your own relative comparative advantage. It is upon you to position yourselves to take advantage of these new opportunities. Our higher institutions of learning have the responsibility of training an internationally competitive labour force to enable Kenya take full advantage of these regional initiatives. The investment opportunities that come with it will allow the appropriate signals of skill requirement. Finally, the Vision 2030 and unemployment in Kenya: The Vision 2030 aims at transforming Kenya into a newly-industrialised, middle income country: what does it mean to solve the unemployment problem of Kenya? To solve unemployment, we need a long-run vision for growth and investment supported by short-run policies like macroeconomic policies, specifically: fiscal and monetary policy and also trade policies. 
4 BIS Review 37/2010 a) Fiscal policy and fiscal stimulus The economy is just emerging from the devastating consequence of drought and the global financial crisis. The pervasiveness and persistence of these shocks required that the government develops a fiscal stimulus. It is important to understand how fiscal stimulus works in an economy like ours: 1. Recognizes support and protection for the wage good through targeted public investment and public works – Kazi Kwa Vijana. 2. A shilling spent in rural Kenya has a higher multiplier effect in the economy. 3. Support local industries – via government expenditure and higher domestic consumption – preserve jobs – prevent layoffs. 4. Increase public investments that are complementary to private investments – in that they enhance profitability of private investments. 5. Finally, in this way the government crowds-in private sector but not crowd-out. b) Monetary policy But perhaps one may ask how has the monetary policy reacted to the crisis and how does it work to support economic activity? Monetary policy works to control the level of money supply consistent with economic activity. Several instruments:  Central Bank Rate (CBR) – as a signalling rate of the stance of monetary policy. It has been progressively reduced from a high of 9 percent in August 2008 to the current level of 7 percent. Lowering of the CBR signalled the intention of the Central Bank for a low interest rate regime to encourage credit extension to the private sector and so investment to support growth.  Cash Ratio Requirement (CRR) – in order to avail liquidity to commercial banks and release more resources for financial intermediation, the Bank has lowered the CRR from 6 percent to 5 percent in December 2008 and further to 4.5 percent in June 2009.  Liquidity management tools: To further enhance liquidity management in the banking system, the Bank has instituted several reforms to introduce new instruments like horizontal repo, vertical repo with fixed tenors.  Financial development: In general an efficient and developed financial system is important to collect and collate savings from micro-savers to investors. Second, an effective monetary policy will depend on an efficient and developed financial system. In concluding my remarks, let me emphasize that employment is a function of economic activity. Sustained economic growth is good for employment. One major solution for sustained growth is a wider market for trade and investment. EAC provides just that. But public investment infusion required to support the private sector investment is immense. Public investment especially in infrastructure will reduce transaction costs for the private sector and allow profitable regional trade. To date 43% of the total Kenyan exports of goods and services go to the EAC region. These exports are mostly manufactured exports. There is scope for more within the EAC and locational advantages. This is what we want to strive for in EAC and these are the positive development agenda EAC presents to Kenya and East African countries. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 37/2010 1 Philip Lowe: Recent developments in the global and Australian economies Speech by Mr Philip Lowe, Assistant Governor (Economic) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the Australian Industry Group 10th Annual Economic Forum, Sydney, 25 March 2010. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to speak this morning. I am very pleased to be able to continue the long-standing relationship between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Australian Industry Group. Over the years, we have found this relationship very valuable and I hope and trust that this will continue. This morning, I would like to talk about some of the recent developments in both the world and Australian economies and the implications of these developments for the outlook for the Australian economy.  The world economy  The world economy is gradually recovering from the worst downturn since World War II. This recovery though is occurring on two different tracks (Graph 1). As a group, the G7 countries are experiencing only relatively weak growth, especially when viewed against the very large contraction in output that occurred. In contrast, the picture in Asia is quite different, with many of the economies in the region having had near V-shaped recoveries. There has also been a reasonably solid bounce back in some other parts of the world with, for example, Brazil growing quite strongly over the past year.

Unemployment rates in both the United States and the euro area are around 10 per cent and a sustained reduction still looks some time off (Graph 2). In contrast, unemployment rates are now clearly falling in Asia and are much lower than in the major advanced economies.

Again, in contrast, core rates have clearly bottomed in Asia and now look to be rising in a number of countries in the region.

The first of these is the need for the advanced economies to consolidate their public finances. The second is the realignment of capital flows, given the likelihood of an extended period of low interest rates in the advanced economies. And the third is the challenge of increasing domestic demand in Asia. (i) Public finances Of these three issues, the one that has attracted the most attention recently is public finances. This is partly the result of what has been going on in Greece but, more broadly, it reflects the difficult fiscal positions in which many advanced economies currently find themselves. In the United States, the federal budget deficit for 2009 was around 10 per cent 
BIS Review 37/2010 3 of GDP. In Japan, the deficit was almost as large, and for the euro area as a whole it was around 6 per cent, with some euro area countries having much larger deficits than this average. Furthermore, these large deficits come after three decades over which the ratio of public debt to GDP for the G7 economies as a whole trended higher (Graph 4). They also come at a time when there will be significant medium-term budget pressures due to the ageing of the population.  Graph 4 0408004080G7 – Net Public DebtPer cent of GDPSource: IMF2014%200920041999199419891984% Over coming years, many governments will need to take significant steps to improve their public finances. The flexibility that they have to determine the timing and size of these steps is limited by the fact that they went into the current downturn with already high levels of debt. As a result of the poor starting points, many are now treading a fairly narrow path. On the one hand, tightening fiscal policy in the very near term risks derailing the recovery, while not doing so risks a damaging loss of confidence. How these risks are managed is likely to have a major effect on how the world economy evolves over the next few years. Presumably, what is required is for the affected countries to have credible medium-term fiscal consolidation strategies. While this is easier to say than to do, ensuring the confidence of investors is an important ingredient if the recovery is to be sustained. (ii) Capital flows This brings me to the second, but related, issue – that of capital flows. Most of the advanced economies are currently operating well below full capacity and, given the subdued nature of the recovery, it is likely to be some time before this excess capacity is wound back. One consequence is that, provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, official interest rates in these economies – which are currently at historically low levels – are likely to remain below average for a considerable period of time (Graph 5). In contrast, elsewhere, including in Asia and Australia where growth is stronger, interest rates are likely to be relatively higher. This interest differential is likely to lead to a flow of capital from the major advanced economies to Asia and other better-performing areas of the world. 
4 BIS Review 37/2010 Graph 5 0481204812G7 – Average Policy RateSources: Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Global Financial Data; Thomson Reuters2010%19901970%200019801960 In Asia, concerns are already emerging about the implications of this. In particular, some countries are worried about the potential for volatile capital flows to be destabilising for their economies. The concern is that capital inflows in the near term will later turn into capital outflows when interest rates in the advanced economies do eventually normalise, and that this could be disruptive. As a way of insuring themselves against this risk, some central banks continue to accumulate foreign reserves. A number of countries in the region are also concerned about the effects of capital inflows on their domestic banking systems, with some having taken steps to rein in bank lending growth, particularly in cases where property prices are increasing strongly. A related consideration is the effect of these capital flows on exchange rates in the region. In general, there is considerably less tolerance for large movements in exchange rates in many of these countries than there is in Australia. In our own case, movements in the value of the Australian dollar are largely seen to be a stabilising force for the economy. There is also a general acceptance of the view that, over the next few years, our real exchange rate is likely to be higher than the average over the past decade or so. In contrast, in much of Asia, where international trade shares are considerably higher than in Australia, movements in exchange rates tend to be viewed with more concern, particularly when they are seen to be driven by speculative capital flows. One other related consideration is the impact on asset markets around the world of an extended period of low official interest rates in the major advanced economies. When the global economy was in this situation around five years ago things did not work out well. While the current environment is very different from that in the middle of the 2000s, this earlier experience suggests that we need to watch the financial side of the global economy very carefully, particularly when interest rates are unusually low. (iii) Domestic demand in Asia The third issue I would like to touch on is the growth of domestic demand in Asia. For some decades, many countries in Asia have had a growth strategy focused on exports. Given the strong growth in consumption in the major western economies, this strategy worked. However, many of the countries in Asia recognise that given the subdued outlook for the advanced economies, there will now need to be a stronger emphasis on growth in domestic demand than has been the case in the past.  China provides a good example here. Over the past two decades, the share of household consumption in Chinese GDP has declined from just under 50 per cent to 35 per cent – a 
BIS Review 37/2010 5 very low level by international standards. This decline reflects two broad developments. The first is a reduction in the share of national income going to households; in the early 1990s, this share stood at nearly 70 per cent, but by late 2008, it had fallen to less than 60 per cent (Graph 6). The second factor is an increase in the household saving rate; in the early 1990s, around 30 per cent of household income was saved, while today this share is close to 40 per cent. Graph 6 China – Household Income and Saving55606570556065702530354025303540Sources: CEIC; RBA2008Disposable incomeShare of nominal GDPSaving ratioShare of disposable income%20032008%1998200319981993 In China, as in many parts of Asia, there is now a recognition that policies to promote consumption are likely to play a more important role than was previously the case. In the past, strong consumption growth was often seen as something that would follow strong exports, rather than be a driver of the economy itself. This view is gradually changing and this is leading to an increased focus on structural reforms to increase the share of national income going to the household sector and to reduce the household saving rate. While reforms in these areas can be difficult, they are important if Asia, as a whole, is to continue to grow strongly in the face of subdued demand for exports from the region. How things play out in each of these three areas – public-sector debt, capital flows and structural policies in Asia – will have a significant impact on the global environment in which the Australian economy finds itself over the year ahead. As the Reserve Bank has spelt out a number of times recently, our central scenario is a relatively positive one. The economies in Asia are expected to continue growing reasonably solidly, while the advanced economies are expected to have only a subdued recovery, weighed down by the need to consolidate balance sheets in both the household and public sectors. Around this central scenario there are, however, clearly risks, particularly associated with the three issues that I have just touched on.  Given these risks, one question is how should policy be set? The Reserve Bank’s general approach has been to proceed on the basis of the central scenario, but be prepared to respond if things turn out differently, as we did in late 2008 when the global outlook took a marked turn for the worse. The alternative of waiting to see how the myriad of risks evolves before adjusting policy runs the significant downside of moving too late, particularly given that the economy is starting this upswing with less spare capacity than in previous upswings. Fortunately, in Australia we have had the policy flexibility to respond to changing events as they have occurred and this has served us well.  
6 BIS Review 37/2010 The Australian economy  I would now like to turn more specifically to the Australian economy, where the run of data over the past few months has tended to be on the firm side. Employment growth has been robust, business and consumer confidence is above average, the housing market has been strong, and there are signs that the period of business deleveraging is coming to an end (Graph 7). Collectively, these outcomes provide us with some confidence that the economy is now in a reasonably solid upswing. Graph 7 Unemployment and Business Confidence-45-30-15015-45-30-150155791157911*Net balance; deviation from long-run averageSources: ABS; NAB; RBA2010%Business confidence*Unemployment rate%%%20062002199819941990 Over the course of this year, the nature of this upswing is, however, likely to change somewhat. Recently, the overall level of spending in Australia has been supported by strong growth in public-sector demand. This has occurred at a time when growth in private-sector demand has been relatively weak (Graph 8). As we move into the second half of 2010, this configuration is likely to change. Public-sector investment is projected to decline, particularly as spending on the Federal Government’s school building program tails off. But moving in the other direction, private-sector business investment is expected to strengthen further, particularly in the resources sector.

BIS Review 37/2010 7 This expected rise in business investment is underpinned by the strong outlook for the terms of trade. Recently, the spot prices of iron ore and coal have risen, and the prices that exporters will receive over the next year look likely to be substantially higher than those received over the past year (Graph 9). As a result, a significant rise in the terms of trade is expected over the year ahead. While movements in the terms of trade do not get the same high-frequency attention as many of the monthly economic indicators, history suggests that they have a large influence on how the overall economy performs. Among other things, they can affect the investment climate, the government’s budget position, asset values, overall confidence in the economy and the growth of domestic incomes.

Over recent times, most indicators of conditions in the established housing market have been very buoyant. Auction clearance rates have been high and nationwide measures of housing prices have been increasing by around 1 per cent a month, with prices in Melbourne rising at an even faster pace (Graph 10). The rental market also remains quite tight, with rents having risen firmly and vacancy rates low.

Total housing loan approvals declined in October, November, December and January, with the declines broader than just for first-home buyers following the scaling back of the additional grants (Graph 11). Some lenders have also tightened terms and conditions, including by further reducing maximum loan-to-valuation ratios (LVRs). And in the lower-priced suburbs of the capital cities, housing prices have broadly moved sideways since October, after earlier significant rises.

It is, however, clearly desirable to avoid significant imbalances developing in the housing market, both in terms of the supply-demand situation and the price and financing dynamics. The pick-up in dwelling construction that is occurring will be helpful here, although further increases are likely to be needed over the medium term. On the financing side, we are currently not seeing the type of financial developments that caused concern in 2002 and 2003 when maximum LVRs were being raised, loan servicing requirements were being eased, new types of mortgage products were being introduced, and risk spreads were being compressed. This is good news, as it would obviously be unhelpful if 
BIS Review 37/2010 9 a speculative cycle were to emerge on the back of the recent strength in housing prices. This is an area that lenders and current and prospective home owners will need to watch carefully over the months ahead. The final topic that I would like to touch on briefly is inflation. Here things have proceeded pretty much as expected. In underlying terms, inflation has moderated significantly, and the year-ended rate is expected to decline from its current rate of around 3¼ per cent to around 2½ per cent over the course of 2010. This decline is being underpinned by the sharp slowing in wage growth in the private sector that we saw over the past year and the appreciation of the exchange rate. In addition, the Reserve Bank’s liaison with retailers suggests that there has been significant discounting recently, and business surveys point to below average price increases. As we move forward, we need to ensure that inflation pressures remain contained and that inflation expectations remain well anchored. Expansion of the supply side of the economy is obviously important here. So too is addressing potential bottlenecks and ensuring that our labour and capital markets are sufficiently flexible so that resources are able to move to where they are most productive. In addition, as the Bank has noted a number of times, with the economy having relatively limited spare capacity, it is likely that interest rates will need to continue their gradual move towards more normal levels. Conclusion  In summary then, our central scenario is for the world economy to grow at around an average pace over the next couple of years, with strong growth in a number of our major trading partners in Asia. However, around this central scenario there are significant risks as the flow-on effects of the events of the past 18 months continue to reverberate around the global economy. While we need to watch these flow-on effects carefully, the outlook for Australia appears to be considerably brighter than that for most other advanced economies.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 36/2010 1 Mark Carney: The virtue of productivity in a wicked world Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Ottawa Economics Association, Ottawa, Ontario, 24 March 2010. *      *      * It is either brave or foolhardy of the Ottawa Economics Association to organize another conference around Canada’s perennial challenges of demographics, productivity, and potential growth.  The cognoscenti wearily deride these shortcomings even while they acknowledge their importance.1 After all, who really wants to talk about getting old? Similarly, the subject of productivity is described as too dull, or worse, too threatening for Canadians. It is said to imply working harder, not smarter, or to promote job losses rather than income gains. These debates are thus thought best confined to the policy wonks, in order that our diagnoses and prescriptions can occur in a parallel, forgotten universe. However, one wonders, who would not want to be productive in their work? Is there a child whom we do not want to reach his or her full potential? Could what Canadians expect of their economy be so very different from what they expect of themselves? Our ambitions for the Canadian economy should be bold. We are a country of immense strengths and, as demonstrated during the recent crisis, considerable resilience.  Yet Canada does underperform. We are not as productive as we could be. Our potential growth is slowing. Moreover, this is occurring as the very nature of the global economy, in which we previously thrived, is under threat. This debate can no longer be avoided. What, then, must be done? There are two imperatives – one domestic, one international – to secure strong, sustainable, and balanced economic growth for Canada. Both recall Aesop’s fable of the ant and the grasshopper, the moral of which can be best summed up as “idleness brings want.” In short, in a wicked world, Canada needs productive virtue. Canada’s slowing potential  This conference has already benefited from comprehensive reviews of productivity and potential growth, so I would like to briefly summarize the Bank’s views (which are largely in accord with the emerging consensus).  We have a problem: demographic drag will increase in coming years. As the boomer generation ages, labour force participation rates will decline and hours worked will fall. The question is merely one of degree. For some age groups, there is a possibility that participation rates will be higher than currently anticipated, particularly since participation rates of older workers have risen since 1996. Moreover, there is a role for policy to reduce further disincentives for participation in the labour market. Nevertheless, it will not be able to reverse longer-run demographic pressures. We have a second, much bigger problem: our abysmal productivity record. Over the past decade, it has averaged a paltry 0.7 per cent, about half the rate recorded over the  1980–2000 period.                                                   1  See, for example, J. Simpson, “Needed urgently: more creativity from the business class.” Globe and Mail, 25 May 2009. 
2 BIS Review 36/2010 The combination of slower productivity growth and demographic shifts could well mean that the average rate of potential growth for the Canadian economy will be closer to 2 per cent going forward than the more than 3 per cent we enjoyed in the first half of the past decade and the latter half of the 1990s.2  If this differential were to persist over a decade, the cumulative loss of income would be almost $30,000 for every Canadian.3 Given Canada’s demographic trends, the principal way to avoid this loss is by improving our productivity. First imperative: improving Canada’s productivity  There appears to be ample opportunity to do so, since Canada is not as productive as it could be. Canada’s productivity ranking has dropped from third of the 20 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1960 to 15th of the current 30 members (see Appendix, Chart 1).4 After some promising signs in the late 1990s, average labour productivity growth has since slowed dramatically (Chart 2). In growth-accounting terms, the main culprit has been multifactor productivity growth, which has slumped markedly, while capital intensity failed to pick up pace.5  I will sketch out three types of explanations based on the research done at the Bank of Canada and by many of you in this room.6  First, measurement challenges for both output and prices in the resources and service sectors could explain some of the shortfall. Second, lags associated with the economy’s adjustment process could be obscuring otherwise strong performance. These include:  longer-tailed resource investments that require substantial upfront expenditures before natural resources can be turned into output, all the while drawing on more marginal reserves; and  the large-scale restructuring of industries and the reallocation of capital and labour to new industries, which naturally dampen productivity as they take place.7  Third, there appear to be deeper structural determinants that will require more concerted efforts on the part of business and government to address:                                                   2  In April 2009, the Bank of Canada lowered its forecast for the growth of potential output to 1.2 per cent in 2009, 1.5 per cent in 2010, and 1.9 per cent in 2011 from 2.4 per cent in 2009 and 2.5 per cent in 2010 and 2011, reflecting significant structural changes and subdued corporate investment. 3  As expressed in 2009 dollars. 4  Compendium of Productivity Indicators, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 2006 and 2008. 5  Multifactor productivity measures joint influences on economic growth, such as technological change, efficiency improvements, and returns to scale. Its growth rate is calculated as the difference between the growth in the amount of output produced and the growth of the quantity of all inputs used, such as labour and machinery and equipment. 6  For a recent summary of Bank of Canada research, see R. Dion, “Interpreting Canada’s Productivity Performance in the Past Decade: Lessons from Recent Research,” Bank of Canada Review (Summer 2007): 19–32, available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/review/summer07/dion.pdf; and R. Dion and R. Fay, “Understanding Productivity: A Review of Recent Technical Research,” Bank of Canada Occasional Paper 2008–3, available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/res/dp/dp(y)_2008.html. 7  Bank of Canada research suggests that job reallocation across firms is a significant positive factor explaining Canadian labour productivity growth over the 1992–2006 period.

Available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/review/summer09/leung.pdf. 
BIS Review 36/2010 3  Canada under-invests in machinery and equipment (M&E), training, and innovation – in fact, all of the underlying drivers of productivity.   Canadian workers have about half the amount of information and communications technology (ICT) of their American counterparts. ICT capital has been linked to stronger multifactor productivity growth in many countries.8   With its highly educated workforce, flexible labour markets, and high rates of firm entry and exit, Canada appears to have all the ingredients needed to be an innovation leader. However, it is only 16th among the OECD countries in the intensity of business research and development.9   Our dismal multifactor productivity growth indicates that Canadian firms do not effectively use the capital that they purchase.10  Some possible explanations for why we both under-invest and appear to use capital so poorly include:   the wrong skills mix: Canada has a well-educated labour force but, perhaps as the structure of the economy shifts, not in the areas required;  small firms: Compared with the United States, Canada has proportionately more small firms that are significantly less productive than large firms;11 and  in particular, inadequate competition in some sectors, especially network industries that have spillovers throughout the economy, including telecommunications, electricity, and retail.12  Whatever the combination of reasons behind Canada’s poor productivity record, there are several avenues available to policy-makers to encourage sustainable longer-run growth.  It is important to acknowledge that successive governments have taken many steps in the right direction. Canadian businesses benefit from a sound macro-policy environment, including sustainable fiscal policy and credible monetary policy, which delivers low, stable, and predictable inflation. Corporate tax competitiveness – particularly for new investment – has improved markedly over the past decade and is now among the most attractive in the industrialised world. Canada has also actively pursued trade openness through new agreements and unilateral tariff reductions.13 Staying the course in these regards is likely the single most important contribution of the public sector.                                                  8  This is not related to industrial structure–it is found in most industries. See A. Sharpe, “What Explains the Canada-US ICT Investment Gap?” Research Report 2005–2006, Centre for the Study of Living Standards (CSLS), December 2005. 9  A recent report concluded that “too many businesses in Canada are technology followers, not leaders” and stressed the need for “innovation-based business strategies.” See P. Nicholson, “Innovation and Business Strategy: Why Canada Falls Short,” International Productivity Monitor, No. 18 (Spring 2009): 51–71. Available at: http://www.csls.ca/ipm/18/IPM-18-Nicholson.pdf. 10  Using a growth-accounting framework, Baldwin and Gu show that multi-factor productivity (MFP) is the main culprit in Canada’s lagging productivity performance. They note that two sectors in particular – mining and oil and gas extraction and manufacturing – account for much of the slowdown in MFP growth in this decade. See J. Baldwin and W. Gu, “Productivity Performance in Canada 1961–2008: An Update of Long-term Trends,” Statistics Canada, 2009. 11  D. Leung, C. Meh, and Y.

4 BIS Review 36/2010 These core framework policies can be supplemented by measures to foster innovation and commercialization, investments in strategic infrastructure, and incentives for scale. Finally, it is vitally important that current global financial sector reform efforts yield a stable and efficient financial system that channels the capital necessary for long-run growth. In general, while there is always more to do, governments have put in place conditions for a productivity revival. Business, thus far, has disappointed. In fact, productivity growth fell in the latest recession, the first time this has happened in three decades. Looking forward, despite the availability of capital, relatively strong balance sheets and improving economic conditions, corporate Canada does not appear ready to invest. Investment intentions for 2010 remain modest and largely driven by the public sector.  This appears unwise. The coming global winter? There could be tough times ahead. Canadian grasshoppers, perhaps basking in the historically easy access to the U.S. market and the relative abundance of resource opportunities, could be in danger of wasting their days in the sun and finding themselves unprepared for the winter to come. Canada’s productivity challenge is made more pressing by an international economic landscape that is changing dramatically. A powerful and sustained restructuring of the global economy has begun. The pace and volatility of global growth are likely to be quite different than during the so-called “Great Moderation” earlier this decade. The considerable uncertainty about medium-term global prospects will require concerted, co-operative measures to moderate. The second imperative: the G-20 framework Policy-makers must work to ensure that business can operate, as much as possible, in an open and stable global economy. At a minimum, this means living up to the G-20 commitment to resist trade and financial protectionism. More proactively, it means substantial reforms to build a more resilient, open, global financial system. Ultimately, as I will discuss in a moment, securing strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth will also require changes in behaviour and policy adjustments on several fronts.  While the recent financial crisis had many causes, its intensity and scope reflected unprecedented disequilibria. Large and unsustainable current account imbalances across major economic areas were integral to the buildup of vulnerabilities in many asset markets. In recent years, the international monetary system failed to promote timely and orderly economic adjustment.14  Further postponing adjustment will only serve to increase vulnerabilities. In the past, the frustration of adjustment by current account surplus countries generated deflationary pressures in the rest of the world. Similarly, today, the adjustment burden is being shifted to others. Some advanced countries – including Canada – have recently seen sizable appreciations of their currencies. Their ability to increase domestic demand in response is limited.                                                  14  This failure has ample precedents. Over the past century, different international monetary regimes have struggled to adjust to structural changes, including the integration of emerging economies into the global economy. In all cases, systemic countries failed to adapt domestic policies in a manner consistent with the monetary system of the day. As a result, adjustment was delayed, vulnerabilities grew, and the reckoning, when it came, was disruptive for all. 
BIS Review 36/2010 5 The net result could be a suboptimal global recovery, in which the adjustment burden in those countries with large imbalances falls largely on domestic prices and wages, rather than on nominal exchange rates. History suggests that this process either could take years, repressing global output and welfare in the interim or lead to another crisis, which would accelerate adjustment, but at a terrible cost. The G-20 framework could address this issue The G-20 framework to promote strong, sustainable, and balanced growth in global demand, launched last November in St. Andrews, Scotland, is an attempt to learn these lessons from history.  The G-20 framework stresses the shared responsibility of countries for global economic performance. Under the framework, members have agreed to a mutual assessment of their monetary, exchange rate, fiscal, and financial policies, with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The implications of these policies for the level and pattern of global growth and the risks to financial stability will be reviewed by finance ministers and central bank governors in preparation for agreement on any common actions by G-20 leaders in Canada and South Korea this year. To illustrate what is at stake, the Bank of Canada has generated three scenarios for the evolution of global growth and current account positions.15  The first is a business-as-usual scenario (Chart 3). No significant changes are made to the current mix of policies, which creates a situation similar to the one that led to the recent crisis. In particular, advanced countries do not make the fiscal adjustments necessary to stabilize their debt dynamics, and their household savings rates do not increase.16 As well, emerging Asia continues to finance the U.S. deficit through reserve accumulation, effectively impeding real exchange rate adjustment.  In the short run, this combination of policies provides a fiscal boost, but it does not last. In response to the rising public debt burden, global interest rates begin to rise, crowding out private investment and ultimately lowering potential growth. This, in turn, further worsens the fiscal situation. Global economic growth falls steadily and, by 2013, it is only 2.7 per cent (compared with the 4 per cent average rate during the Great Moderation of 2002–07). More alarmingly, global imbalances reassert at an explosive rate. Paths for public and external debt are unsustainable and could lead to another crisis.  An obvious lesson to draw from this scenario is that advanced countries need to engage in fiscal consolidation over the medium term. Indeed, that is the express policy of all industrialised countries. But would that alone be sufficient to rebalance the global economy?  Consider a second scenario in which there is fiscal consolidation in advanced countries such that debt-to-GDP stabilizes by 2015 (Chart 4).17 Other countries maintain current policies. In particular, there is neither a real effective exchange rate adjustment nor an increase in the trend of domestic demand growth in Asia’s emerging economies.                                                   15  Note that these scenarios are purely illustrative and do not represent the Bank’s base-case projection. They were generated using BoC-GEM-FIN, the Bank’s global general-equilibrium macro model. See K. Beaton, C. de Resende, R. Lalonde, and S. Snudden, “Prospects for Global Current Account Rebalancing,” Bank of Canada Discussion Paper, forthcoming in 2010. 16  Countries do not make the necessary fiscal adjustments to stabilize their debt dynamics. There is no stabilization in debt-to-GDP ratios by 2015. In the “framework” scenario, debt/GDP in the United States stabilizes around 75 per cent of GDP. In this “do nothing” scenario, U.S. debt/GDP would reach about 95 per cent of GDP by 2015. 17  At 120 per cent for the United States, 130 per cent for Euro area. 
6 BIS Review 36/2010 In this scenario, there is deficient demand globally. With monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound, deflation emerges. As a consequence, real interest rates increase sharply, growth stalls, and fiscal consolidation becomes more difficult.  It is cold comfort that global imbalances are effectively eliminated. The cost is a prolonged global recession, with massive foregone output. If this scenario were to occur, the risk of protectionism would undoubtedly rise, potentially exacerbating the damage. Finally, consider a “framework scenario,” one that highlights the large gains that the G-20 process could – and should – produce (Chart 5). In this case, the fiscal consolidation of the second scenario is complemented by policies to increase domestic demand in emerging Asia and a modest real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar (across all major currencies).  In this case, current account imbalances stabilize at low levels and, more importantly, global growth rises to 3.7 per cent in 2010 and 4.5 per cent in 2011. Growth is strong, sustainable, and balanced. There is no doubt we would all be much better off with the last scenario (Table 1). By 2015, the difference in the level of global GDP between the deflation and framework scenarios is about 12 per cent (Chart 6).18 For Canada, the difference would be 10 per cent of Canadian GDP.19  The morality of global imbalances If the gains to rebalancing are so considerable, why isn’t it assured that countries will take the necessary steps? There are two issues: misdiagnosis and coordination. Regarding the former, some view global imbalances, not as a missed opportunity but, rather, a modern morality tale. To them, deficit countries are the profligate grasshoppers whiling away their hours in the sun, while the surplus countries are ants prudently husbanding resources in anticipation of winter.  The problem with this diagnosis is that it ignores the symbiotic nature of the global economy. Excess savings in some countries go hand-in-hand with excess dissavings in others. Taken to the extreme, the husbanding of resources makes the economic winter more likely. The thrift of the Swabian housewife or the obsessive self-insurance of the emerging giants is globally debilitating and self-defeating. Hegel’s observation that all societies die from the morbid intensification of their own first principles comes to mind.  The drivers of domestic demand cannot be concentrated in the same countries forever. As the Managing Director of the IMF has suggested, not all countries can simultaneously export their way to growth.20  The framework process does not appeal to a country’s altruism. As shown in Table 1, the framework scenario is pareto improving – every region is better off under it.  The second issue is coordination. To stimulate private domestic demand, surplus countries could enhance their social safety nets, reform financial systems to liberate trapped savings from small and medium-sized enterprises, and sharpen relative price signals (in part through greater exchange rate flexibility). While it is in their own interests to implement these policies,                                                  18  Or a total of $7 trillion. 19  According to the Bank’s rough calculations, the cumulative U.S.-dollar purchasing-power-parity income per citizen would increase by about US$3,000 by 2015. Five years later, in 2020, it would be about US$11,700. 20  Dominique Strauss-Kahn, as cited in C. Giles, “IMF warning over reliance on exports,” Financial Times, 30 January 2010. 
BIS Review 36/2010 7 surplus countries could be further encouraged by industrialised countries implementing the necessary complementary measures. In particular, industrialised countries must develop credible medium-term plans for fiscal consolidation and implement them once the recovery is firmly entrenched. Moreover, it is essential that industrialised countries, particularly those at the epicentre of the financial crisis, implement a series of financial reforms to increase the resilience of the global financial system. This means more and better bank capital, improved market infrastructure for derivatives and funding markets, and a series of initiatives to end “too-big-to-fail.”21  It will not be enough to propose. Measures must also be credibly implemented. That is why the peer review process of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and external reviews by the IMF are so important. Through these processes, financial reforms could increase actual and perceived systemic stability and thereby encourage mutually supportive policies in surplus countries. Finally, all countries will need to maintain their commitment to price stability. I will now turn to this issue in Canada before concluding.  Update on the inflation outlook The global economy has evolved largely as expected. Strong growth in many emerging-market economies has been accompanied by positive though uneven growth in most advanced countries. Although the level of economic activity is now somewhat higher than projected, the outlook for inflation and economic growth in the global economy over the near term remains essentially unchanged, with exceptional monetary and fiscal stimulus continuing to provide important support in many countries. Economic activity in Canada has surprised slightly on the upside in recent weeks relative to the projection in our January Monetary Policy Report. Growth has been driven mainly by domestic demand, but exports have also recovered further in response to improving external demand. Significant policy stimulus, combined with increased confidence, improved financial conditions, and higher terms of trade, are the main factors supporting growth in Canada’s domestic demand.  At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar and the low absolute level of U.S. demand in certain key sectors, such as autos and housing, will continue to act as significant drags on economic activity in Canada. Core inflation has been slightly firmer than projected, the result of both transitory factors and the higher level of economic activity. The outlook for inflation should continue to reflect the combined influences of stronger domestic demand, slowing wage growth, and overall excess supply. At its 2 March 2010 decision, the Bank reconfirmed that the target overnight rate can be expected to remain at its current level until the end of the second quarter of 2010 in order to achieve the inflation target. This commitment is expressly conditional on the outlook for inflation, which will be updated in the Bank’s next Monetary Policy Report, to be published on 22 April.                                                  21  For a more detailed discussion, see M. Carney, “Reforming the Global Financial System.” Speech to the Autorité des marchés financiers, Montréal, Québec, 26 October 2009. 
8 BIS Review 36/2010 Conclusion In conclusion, the twin challenges of boosting Canadian productivity and of implementing the G-20 framework globally are daunting. But the gains are considerable. Now is not the time to rest on our laurels or to take an open global economy for granted. The Bank is committed to tackling these important issues. We have a broad research agenda on productivity. We are working with our domestic and international partners to reform the global financial system. We are active participants in G-20 framework discussions, not merely because they offer the best outcome for the global economy but also because they are in Canada’s interests.  Finally, and most fundamentally, the Bank has an unwavering commitment to price stability. The single, most direct contribution that monetary policy can make to sound economic performance is to provide Canadians with confidence that their money will retain its purchasing power. That means keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. Price stability lowers uncertainty, minimizes the costs of inflation, reduces the cost of capital, and creates an environment in which households and firms can invest and plan for the future.

BIS Review 36/2010 1 Thomas Jordan: Bank regulation – what went wrong? What will improve? Summary of a speech by Mr Thomas Jordan, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Forum für Universität und Gesellschaft, Berne, 24 March 2010. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * The financial crisis has caused enormous damage. Massive losses were recorded in the global banking system. Many countries have gone through the worst recession since the Second World War. Government rescue measures had to be implemented to stabilise the financial system. Existing bank regulations were not able to prevent the crisis, nor were they able to at least contain the damage to such an extent that government rescue packages would not have become necessary.  While before the financial crisis, there was considerable uncertainty about possible shortcomings in bank regulation, these have now become apparent and will have to be tackled. In addition, the provision of implicit state guarantees has made the need for action even more urgent. Big banks – believing that they will receive government assistance if they run into problems – have even stronger incentives now to take on excessive risk. This increases the risk of another crisis and erodes the fundamental principle of the market economy – competition. Once again, in the future, banks will have to bear their own risks. The failure of a bank should no longer jeopardise the stability of our financial system. Only then, will our financial system become less prone to risk and will the extent of future crises clearly decrease. In order to achieve this goal, several measures have been decided on in Switzerland. First, new capital adequacy requirements were enacted in 2008. Big banks will have to double their risk-weighted capital. In addition, they will have to hold a minimum amount of equity capital, irrespective of the risk models they use internally. This is because the crisis has shown that internal risk models massively underestimated the risks taken. Second, new liquidity regulations will be adopted. In the future, big banks will have to hold a sufficient amount of high-quality liquid funds to be able to cover unexpected liquidity losses for a period of at least 30 days. The reason for this is that, in the financial crisis, even solvent banks had liquidity problems. Finally, measures to solve the “too big to fail” issue must be put into practice. No bank should be so systemically important that governments feel forced to rescue it from impending failure, fearing the economic costs such a failure would cause. Possible solutions to the “too big to fail” issue are the creation of incentives to encourage banks to reduce their size or change their organisational structure. 
BIS Review 36/2010 1 Donald L Kohn: Homework assignments for monetary policymakers Speech by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Cornelson Distinguished Lecture at Davidson College, Davidson, North Carolina, 24 March 2010. *      *      * The events of the past few years have raised many questions for central bankers. Although prompt and innovative actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped prevent a severe economic downturn from turning into something even worse, our experience also highlighted a number of areas we need to study further to see whether we can improve the conduct of monetary policy. I’ve titled my presentation “Homework Assignments” because I don’t think the answers are clear, though I will venture some tentative thoughts. I have four assignments on my list; I could easily have more. And others would have yet a different list. I recognize that the complexity of these questions could keep us profitably engaged for a whole semester, but let’s see if I can outline some of the challenges and possible responses in an evening. The first two assignments concern the policy actions the Federal Reserve and other central banks took during the financial crisis. A key part of the Federal Reserve’s response was to fulfill its traditional role of providing backup liquidity to sound institutions during times of financial turmoil. In a break with tradition, we had to provide that liquidity to nonbank financial institutions as well as to banks. One assignment is to evaluate the implications of the changing character of financial markets for the design of the liquidity tools the Federal Reserve has at its disposal when panic-driven runs on banks and other key financial intermediaries and markets threaten financial stability and the economy. In addition to providing liquidity on an unprecedented scale, we reduced our policy interest rate (the target for the rate on overnight loans between banks) effectively to zero, and then we continued to ease financial conditions and cushion the effect of the financial shock on the economy by making large-scale purchases of several types of securities. My second assignment involves improving our understanding of the effects of those purchases and the associated massive increase in bank reserves. The third and fourth assignments relate to whether changes to the conduct of monetary policy in normal times could make financial instability and its wrenching and costly economic consequences less likely. Number three involves considering whether central banks should use their conventional monetary policy tool – adjusting the level of a short-term interest rate – to try to rein in asset prices that seem to be moving well away from sustainable values, in addition to seeking to achieve the macroeconomic objectives of full employment and price stability. The fourth and final assignment concerns whether central banks should adjust their inflation targets to reduce the odds of getting into a situation again where the policy interest rate reaches zero.1  Changes in financial markets and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity tools Financial markets have evolved substantially in recent decades. The task of intermediating between investors and borrowers has shifted over time from banks, which take deposits and make loans, to securities markets, where borrowers and savers meet more directly, albeit with the assistance of investment banks that help borrowers issue securities and then make                                                  1  The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. William Nelson of the Board’s staff contributed to these remarks. 
2 BIS Review 36/2010 markets in those securities. An aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which loans that might have been on the books of banks are converted into securities and sold in markets. Serious deficiencies with these securitizations, the associated derivative instruments, and the structures that evolved to hold securitized debt were at the heart of the financial crisis. Among other things, the structures exposed the banking system to risks that neither participants in financial markets nor regulators fully appreciated. The implications of these changes are far reaching, but I want to concentrate on those that bear on the tools we use to supply liquidity to the financial system. Every central bank had to adapt its liquidity facilities to some degree, but the Federal Reserve had to adapt more than most. Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve adjusted the liquidity it provided to the financial system through daily operations with a relatively small set of broker-dealers against a very narrow set of collateral – Treasury debt, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Those transactions had the effect of changing the quantity of reserve balances that banks hold at Federal Reserve Banks, and that liquidity was distributed by interbank funding markets through the banking system in the United States and around the world. In addition, the Federal Reserve stood ready to lend directly to commercial banks and other depository institutions at the “discount window.” At their discretion, banks could borrow overnight at an above-market rate against a broad range of collateral when they had a need for very short-term funding. But this structure proved inadequate in the crisis. Interbank markets stopped functioning as effective means to distribute liquidity, increasing the importance of direct lending through the discount window. At the same time, however, banks became extremely reluctant to borrow from the Federal Reserve for fear that the borrowing would become known and thus cast doubt on their liquidity condition. Importantly, the crisis also involved major disruptions of important funding markets for other institutions. Commercial paper markets no longer served as sources of funds to lenders or to nonfinancial businesses; investment banks could not borrow for even a short term on a secured basis when lenders began to have doubts about some of the underlying collateral; banks overseas could not reliably exchange their currency in swap markets to fund their dollar assets beyond the very shortest terms; and investors pulled out from money market mutual funds. These disruptions posed the same threats to the availability of credit to households and businesses as did runs on banks in a more bank-centric financial system. Intermediaries unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the crisis; they were unwilling to make markets necessary to allow households and businesses to borrow; and households and businesses unable to borrow were unable to spend, deepening the recession. The Federal Reserve responded by providing funding when it became unavailable to banks and other intermediaries. We reduced the spread of the discount rate over the target interbank rate, lengthened the maximum maturity of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, and also provided discount window credit through regular auctions to overcome the reluctance to borrow. In addition, we created emergency liquidity facilities to meet the funding needs of key market participants, including primary securities dealers, money market mutual funds, and other users of short-term funding markets.2 We did so while generally adhering to time-honored central banking principles for countering a financial panic: Lend freely to solvent institutions at a penalty and against good collateral. We also lent dollars to other central banks so that they could help banks in their jurisdictions meet their dollar funding needs, thus easing pressures on U.S. money markets. Now that the financial markets are functioning much better, we have closed the emergency facilities that we created to lend to nonbanks. The homework assignment is to think about the                                                  2  Primary dealers are broker-dealers that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
BIS Review 36/2010 3 design of liquidity facilities going forward. I’ve tentatively concluded that the recent crisis has demonstrated that in a financial system so dependent on securities markets and not just banks, we need to retain the ability to lend against good collateral to certain groups of sound, regulated, nonbank financial firms. I’m not suggesting that we establish permanent contingency liquidity facilities, just that the Federal Reserve retain the authority to create the tools necessary to meet liquidity needs of groups of nonbank institutions should a panic impair the ability of securities markets, as well as banks, to function and the Board of Governors find that the absence of such functioning would threaten the economy.3 The collateral would have to be of good quality and the institutions sound to minimize any credit risk to the Federal Reserve. Holding open this possibility is not without cost. With credit potentially available from the Federal Reserve, institutions would have insufficient incentives to manage their liquidity to protect against unusual market events. Hence, the emergency credit would generally be provided only to groups of institutions that were regulated and supervised to limit such moral hazard. If the Federal Reserve did not directly supervise the institutions that would potentially receive emergency discount window credit, we would need an ongoing and collaborative relationship with the supervisor. The supervisor should ensure that any institution with implicit access to emergency discount window credit nevertheless maintained conservative liquidity policies. The supervisor would also provide critical insight into the financial condition of the borrower and the quality of the available collateral and more generally whether lending was necessary and appropriate. Large-scale asset purchases and the buildup of the reserve base The Federal Reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 2008 not only by opening new liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to close to zero. Such rapid and aggressive responses were expected to cushion the effects of the shock on the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, thereby encouraging them to keep spending. In addition, the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks have provided more guidance than usual about the likely future path of interest rates to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly uncertain economic and financial environment. In particular, we were concerned that market participants would not fully appreciate for how long we anticipated keeping interest rates low. If they hadn’t, intermediate- and longer-term rates would have declined by less, reducing the stimulative effect of the very low policy rates. Given the severity of the downturn, it became clear that lowering short-term policy rates alone would not be sufficient. We needed to go further to ease financial conditions and encourage spending. Thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, we purchased large quantities of longer-term securities, specifically Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt. Central banks have lots of experience guiding the economy by adjusting short-term policy rates and influencing expectations about future policy rates, and the underlying theory and practice behind those actions are well understood. However, the economic effects of purchasing large volumes of longer-term assets, and the accompanying expansion of the reserve base in the banking system, are much less well understood. So my second homework assignment for monetary policymakers and other interested economists is to study the effects of such balance sheet expansion; better understanding will help our                                                  3  I am not referring here to the loans we extended to individual troubled institutions like American International Group, whose disorderly failure would have had catastrophic consequences for the economy. That sort of lending is more appropriately done by the fiscal authorities and conducted only in association with the exercise of new authority to regulate and resolve systemically important institutions. 
4 BIS Review 36/2010 successors if, unfortunately, they should find themselves in a similar position, and it will help us as we unwind the unusual actions we took. One question involves the direct effects of the large-scale asset purchases themselves. The theory behind the Federal Reserve’s actions was fairly clear: Arbitrage between short- and long-term markets is not perfect even when markets are functioning smoothly; and arbitrage is especially impaired during panics when investors are putting an unusually large premium on the liquidity and safety of short-term instruments. In these circumstances, reducing the supply of long-term debt pushes up the prices of the securities, lowering their yields. But by how much? Uncertainty about the likely effect complicated our calibration of the purchases, and the symmetrical uncertainty about the effects of unwinding the actions – of reducing our portfolio – will be a factor in our decisions about the timing and sequencing of steps to return the portfolio to a more normal level and composition. Good studies of these sorts of actions are sparse. Currently, we are relying in large part on studies that examine how much interest rates dropped when purchases were announced in the United States or abroad. But such event studies may not be an ideal means to predict the consequences of reducing our portfolio, in part because the economic and financial environment will be very different, and also because event studies do not measure effects that develop or reverse over time. We are also uncertain about how, exactly, the purchases put downward pressure on interest rates. My presumption has been that the effect comes mainly from the total amount we purchase relative to the total stock of debt outstanding. However, others have argued that the market effect derives importantly from the flow of our purchases relative to the amount of new issuance in the market. Some evidence for the primacy of the stock channel has accumulated recently, as the prices of mortgage-backed securities appear to have changed little as the flow of our purchases has trended down. A second issue involves the effect of the large volume of reserves created as we buy assets. The Federal Reserve has funded its purchases by crediting the accounts that banks hold with us. Those deposits are called “reserve balances” and are part of bank reserves. In our explanations of our actions, we have concentrated, as I have just done, on the effects on the prices of the assets we have been purchasing and the spillover to the prices of related assets. The huge quantity of bank reserves that were created has been seen largely as a byproduct of the purchases that would be unlikely to have a significant independent effect on financial markets and the economy. This view is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to the money supply to economic activity and inflation. Other central banks and some of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have emphasized this channel in their discussions of the effect of policy at the zero lower bound. According to these types of theories, extra reserves should induce banks to diversify into additional lending and purchases of securities, reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, and so should spark an increase in the money supply and spending. To date, that channel does not seem to have been effective; interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks have continued to rise, the quantity of bank loans is still falling rapidly, and money supply growth has been subdued. Banks’ behavior appears more consistent with the standard Keynesian model of the liquidity trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates approach zero. But portfolio behavior of banks will shift as the economy and confidence recover, and we will need to watch and study this channel carefully. Another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale purchases of longer-term assets on expectations about monetary policy. The more we buy, the more reserves we will ultimately need to absorb and the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet can return completely to normal. As a consequence, these types of purchases can increase inflation expectations among some 
BIS Review 36/2010 5 observers who may see a risk that we will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion. In fact, longer-term inflation expectations generally have been quite well anchored over the past few years of unusual Federal Reserve actions. And we are developing and testing the tools we need to remove accommodative monetary policy when appropriate. I am confident the Federal Reserve can and will tighten policy well in advance of any threat to price stability, and successful execution of this exit will demonstrate that these emergency steps need not lead to higher inflation. Monetary policy and financial imbalances The past few years have illustrated two lessons about the relationship between macroeconomic stability and financial stability. First, macroeconomic stability doesn’t guarantee financial stability; indeed, in some circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster financial instability by lulling people into complacency about risks. And second, some shocks to the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by conventional monetary policy. Given the heavy costs of the financial crisis, the question naturally arises as to how it could have been avoided. My third assignment is to reexamine whether conventional monetary policy should be used to lean against financial imbalances as well as aim for the traditional medium-term macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability. One key question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the effects of policy adjustments on those misalignments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives. Obviously, reducing the odds of financial crises would be very beneficial, but we need to balance that important objective against the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that purpose. One type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument. Increases in interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be experiencing speculative activity. Moreover, small policy adjustments may not be very effective in reining in speculative excesses. Our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot-com stock speculation in the first episode or on house price increases in the second. And larger adjustments would incur greater incremental costs. As a consequence, using monetary policy to damp asset price movements could lead to more variability in output and inflation around their objectives, at least in the medium term. Among other things, greater variability in inflation could lead inflation expectations to become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations. We simply do not have good theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in using short-term interest rates to limit financial speculation. Given our current state of knowledge, my preference at this time would be to use regulation and supervision to strengthen the financial system and lean against developing problems. Monetary policy would be used only if imbalances were building and regulatory policies either were unavailable or had proven ineffective. The homework assignment is to improve our ability to identify incipient financial imbalances and understand their interactions with changes in policy interest rates. A related issue, which I’ll assign for extra credit, is critical for the conduct of policy in the future. Some observers have attributed the bubbles observed in some asset prices in recent years to a decades-long downward trend in real interest rates. In this view, the decline in interest rates has caused investors to reach for yield by purchasing riskier assets with higher returns, driving the prices on riskier assets above fundamental values. Many critics of central banks ascribe the drop in real rates to monetary policy decisions that kept rates unusually 
6 BIS Review 36/2010 low, on average, over the business cycle From my perspective, the decisions the central banks were making about their policy rates were shaped by the underlying determinants of the balance of saving and investment, including, in the past decade or so, the high saving propensities of the newly emerging Asian economies and the sluggish rebound in investment globally after the recession early last decade. Nonetheless, it is important that we understand the reasons for the decline in average real rates and whether low rates are likely to persist – and that very tough problem is the extra credit assignment. For one thing, as the economic expansion gains traction and central banks back off the current highly accommodative stance of policy, policymakers will need to understand how the longer-term trend in real rates has influenced the point at which the policy rate becomes restrictive. For another, if rates are going to continue to be low by historical standards, regulators will need to be especially alert to any signs that a reach for yield by investors is contributing to excessive risk-taking. Inflation objectives The final homework assignment concerns the inflation objectives of central banks. Central banks have widely chosen to target inflation rates near 2 percent. The Federal Reserve is required by law to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices. We haven’t announced an explicit inflation rate target consistent with that dual mandate, but the Federal Reserve governors and Reserve Bank presidents publish our individual forecasts for inflation over the longer run, conditional on our individual views of appropriate monetary policy. Those forecasts indicate that most of the FOMC participants believe that inflation should converge to 1–3/4 to 2 percent over time. Recently, some prominent economists have called for central banks to raise their inflation targets to about 4 percent. Shifting inflation targets up would tend to raise the average level of nominal interest rates and thus give central banks more room to lower interest rates in response to a bad shock to the economy before running against the zero bound. Although I agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, I do not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets. Central banks around the world have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by businesses and households when making decisions about the future. Moreover, inflation expectations are well anchored at those low levels. Increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse economic outcomes over time. First of all, inflation expectations would necessarily have to become unanchored as inflation moved up. I doubt households and businesses would immediately adjust their expectations up to the new targets and that expectations would then be well anchored at the new higher levels. Instead, I fear there could be a long learning process, just as there was as inflation trended down over recent decades. Second, 4 percent inflation may be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise transitory inflation would become more persistent. For both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other economic conditions. That greater sensitivity would reduce the ability of central banks to buffer the economy from bad shocks. It could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates. It is notable that while the economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis. Another approach to this problem is for central banks to target a gradually rising price level rather than a constant inflation rate. Imagine a plot of the consumer price index (CPI) from today onward increasing 2 percent each year. Central banks would commit to adjusting policy to keep the CPI near that line. 
BIS Review 36/2010 7 The advantage of this approach, in theory at least, is that when a negative shock drives prices below the target level, people will automatically expect the central bank to increase inflation for a while to get back to trend. In principle, that expectation would lower real interest rates without the central bank changing its inflation commitment, even if nominal interest rates were pinned at zero. It could also make it easier for people to make long-term economic decisions because they could anticipate that inflation misses would be reversed over time, reducing uncertainty about the future price level. While I appreciate the elegance of this price-level-targeting idea, I have serious doubts that it would work in practice. Central to the idea is that the Federal Reserve would be committing to hit a price level that was growing at a constant rate from a fixed point in the past. The specific inflation rate that could be expected in the future would change over time, depending on the inflation that had been realized up to that point. You could know what inflation rate to expect only if you knew both the current consumer price index and the Fed’s target for the index in the future. In addition, the inflation rate that you could expect would be different for different horizons. Moreover, central banks are able to control inflation only with a considerable lag and even then only imprecisely, so the process of hitting a target would likely involve frequent overshooting and correction and consequently frequently shifting inflation objectives. Contrast this approach with the communications required of central banks when targeting a specific inflation rate. For example, central banks targeting a 2 percent inflation rate typically put that target prominently on their webpage. If those banks were instead targeting a price level growing at 2 percent, their webpages would have to provide a table of inflation rate targets for a variety of horizons, and the targets would change each month. I fear that rather than anchoring people’s expectations about prices, it could leave them perplexed. As you can tell, I see compelling reasons why central banks should stick to their current inflation objectives. Those reasons relate most importantly to the effect of a central bank’s communications and behavior on its credibility and on the public’s expectations. More study leading to a better understanding of the linkage between central bank actions and expectation formation should improve the ability of central banks to achieve society’s inflation and output objectives more effectively under a variety of circumstances, including in a severe negative shock of the type we recently experienced. Conclusion Many central bankers and economists, myself included, were a little complacent coming into the crisis. We thought we knew enough about the basic structure of the markets and the economy to achieve economic and price stability with relatively minor perturbations. And we thought we had the tools necessary to deal with liquidity shortages and maldistributions. The reality is that we didn’t understand the economy as well as we thought we did. Central bankers, along with other policymakers, professional economists and the private sector failed to foresee or prevent a financial crisis that resulted in very serious unemployment and loss of wealth around the world. We must learn from our experience. The questions I’ve posed are tough, but addressing these issues successfully should enable central banks to reduce the odds of future crises and respond more effectively to any bouts of instability that still might arise. 
BIS Review 35/2010 1 Nils Bernstein: The Danish krone during the crisis Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, 22 March 2010. *      *      * It is now my turn to discuss how Denmark – as a non-euro area EU, ERM II member state – has navigated through the financial crisis. The really interesting question is, perhaps, what difference it would have made, if we had been part of the euro area. That is difficult to say, as other things might not have been equal. For example: who knows whether Denmark’s economic policy would have been the same, if we had not been governed by the fixed-exchange-rate policy? (Chart 1) Since the euro was rejected in a referendum in 2000, it has been a widespread view, that Danish membership of the euro area is first and foremost a political question. Combined with the other three opt-outs, the issue is whether Denmark wants to participate fully in the important political decisions on the future of Europe. From a purely economic point of view, Danish participation in the euro can be expected to lead to slightly lower interest rates, a small increase in foreign trade and lower transaction costs. In normal, calm periods, interest rates will only be marginally lower than under the current fixed-exchange rate regime. Over a longer horizon, adopting the euro will have a certain positive overall effect on growth in Denmark. But it is difficult to quantify this effect, which is hardly likely to be felt in the short term. Danmarks Nationalbank’s rough estimate is that, in the long term, euro area membership would permanently boost GDP by between 0.5 and 1 per cent.  Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, Denmark has performed well outside the euro area. This is due to our long-standing stability-oriented economic policy with a focus on medium-term objectives and structural reforms, not least in the labour market. It is important that Denmark continues along this path – even if we eventually join the euro. The current economic policy discussion should be viewed in that context.  All along, we have been aware that the advantages of euro area membership would be accentuated in periods of financial turmoil. The lessons from the financial crisis have more than confirmed this. The world before Lehman fell The seeds of the financial crisis were sown already in July 2007, when the rating agencies decided to downgrade bonds issued to finance sub-prime mortgages. This increased uncertainty in the markets. The effect soon spread to more creditworthy securities. In the money markets, the uncertainty was reflected in a widening spread between collateralised and uncollateralised money-market loans. The confidence crisis developed in stages over the latter part of 2007 and up to September 2008. In August 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank with a government guarantee and the Danish Contingency Association acquired Roskilde Bank on the brink of collapse. This was an important medium-sized bank, with a significant funding in foreign currencies. This should be seen in the light of a Danish banking sector with a total deposit deficit of 600 billion kr. Danmarks Nationalbank’s primary reason for stepping in was to avoid a systemic crisis. In that situation we couldn’t accept doubts that loans to Danish banks would be honoured. 
2 BIS Review 35/2010 Capital outflows from smaller areas The financial crisis intensified from mid-September 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Bros. Risky assets such as shares and credit bonds plummeted. The heightened uncertainty prompted investors to seek safe havens. This led to portfolios shifts towards more secure assets. There was a worldwide trend for foreign exchange to flow out of small capital areas and into larger ones. In other cases, portfolios were actually closed by investors who had bought assets, financed by short-term loans in foreign currency – such as dollars – that were subject to regular renewal. Investors who were unable to obtain renewed funding in early October 2008, when the international loan markets1 froze, were compelled to sell assets immediately, regardless of the price. The interest-rate increases by Danmarks Nationalbank, – which I will return to – did not have any impact on investors, who were forced to sell out, when the global loan markets contracted. Liquidity constraints – the need for euro and dollars Initially the money-market turmoil was strongest in the dollar market, and many financial institutions outside the USA experienced a shortage of dollar funding. As the crisis escalated, the euro market was eventually also affected.  In the spring of 2008, the ECB established a swap line with the Fed, with a view of lending dollars to euro area banks. The majority of the Danish banks did not have access to this facility. Many financial institutions in Europe already depended on short-term funding in both dollars and euro. As a result, most of them were on the same side of the order flow. Moreover, the usual dollar funding channels dried up, to a certain extent because the suppliers themselves had an increasing need for dollars, which in itself was partially due to mounting concerns about counterparty risk. This put pressure on both the demand and supply sides of the dollar market. Impact on the Danish krone The dysfunctional markets for, primarily, euro and dollars had a considerable impact on the market for Danish kroner. Danish banks needed access to funding in euro and dollars; a need that was to some extent satisfied by issuing CP and trading in the FX swap market. In principle, the use of FX swaps has no impact on the exchange rate of the krone. But as the crisis evolved, funding and hedging in the FX swap market became expensive, and the spot markets became a more attractive source of foreign exchange. As a result, the krone came under pressure. Developments in the euro area were particularly significant for the krone. In late September and early October 2008, extensive demand for euro liquidity meant that the average allotment rate, in the ECB’s weekly main refinancing operations, exceeded Danmarks Nationalbank’s lending rate. In other words, the interest-rate spread turned negative. Usually the spread is positive to compensate for the exchange-rate risk. In early October, just before the ECB began to offer unlimited liquidity at a fixed rate of interest (the lending rate), the ECB’s average allotment rate was observed to be a full 39 basis points higher than Danmarks Nationalbank’s lending rate. As a result, the krone came under pressure.                                                  1 The interbank market for uncollateralised lending, the CP market, and the FX swap market. 
BIS Review 35/2010 3 Speculation against the krone At the peak of the crisis, many market rumours were circulating, claiming that Danmarks Nationalbank was in difficulties. A large foreign bank wrote that Danmarks Nationalbank no longer had any reserves for intervention and that the exchange rate was approaching its limit, i.e. a deviation of 2.25 per cent from the central rate. If that situation does occur, the ECB has an obligation to intervene in support of the krone. So far this has never happened. The ERM II agreement includes a provision on unlimited intervention credit between the ECB and the participating central banks, including Danmarks Nationalbank. Such credit must be repaid within three months.  There was extensive market focus on the size of our foreign-exchange reserve. More specifically, a limit of DKK 100 billion was mentioned for Danmarks Nationalbank to be able to defend the krone.  The currency positions of the Danish banks in the market were, on the whole, not unfavourable to the krone (Chart 2). The banks reduced their market positions, to more or less neutral levels, but never held long currency positions, when Danmarks Nationalbank made intervention purchases to support the krone. This reflected some degree of confidence on the part of the Danish banks, that Danmarks Nationalbank would be able to observe the unofficial de facto band. There was anecdotal “evidence” that certain foreign investors were speculating against the krone (Chart 3). The first speculation rumours concerned options, with a strike price outside the implicit narrow band around the central rate. For example, a large hedge fund was reputed to have bought options against the krone weakening. The size of the financial backing behind this speculation is, however, uncertain. “Out-of-the-money” options involve little cost, but hedging by sellers of such options may have led to considerable sales of kroner. Generally speaking, international speculators had a certain interest in testing the strength of the support for the fixed-exchange-rate policy. This caused further uncertainty about the krone. Intervention The spring of 2008 saw gradual weakening of the krone, and Danmarks Nationalbank Danmarks responded by intervening – to a limited extent (Chart 4). As late as in July 2008, we mirrored the ECB when it raised its key interest rates. Danmarks Nationalbank took the usual course of action when the krone came under pressure. First, we sell foreign exchange for kroner. If this has not had the desired effect after some time, we raise interest rates. To counter the tensions in the dollar market, Danmarks Nationalbank intervened in the FX swap market on 18 September, i.e. before the crisis really erupted. Dollars were offered against kroner for a total of DKK 3 billion with a maturity of 7 days. Likewise, in early October, Danmarks Nationalbank intervened in the euro market, offering euro for a total of DKK 17 billion with maturities of 7 days and 1 month. Danmarks Nationalbank had not previously intervened in the FX swap market in recent times.  The intervention in the FX swap market turned out to have only a temporary impact on the market. The Danish market for euro and dollar liquidity is considerable, and intervention via the FX swap market also entails drawing substantial amounts on the foreign-exchange reserve.  Pressure on the krone prompted Danmarks Nationalbank to intervene heavily directly in the foreign-exchange market in late September and the first weeks of October. Intervention sales of foreign exchange totalled DKK 1 billion in September and reached a monthly all-time high 
4 BIS Review 35/2010 of DKK 64 billion in October. There were considerable day-to-day fluctuations. On some days, intervention purchases approached DKK 15 billion. Intervention by Danmarks Nationalbank was concentrated in the periods around 7 and 24 October, when we raised our interest rates. We could literally see our reserves pouring out of our coffers. I felt like driving a car without brakes.  Monetary-policy interest rates Sustained strong pressure on the krone led Danmarks Nationalbank to increase monetary-policy interest rates on several occasions in October (Chart 5). On 7 October, the lending rate was raised by 0.4 percentage point. The following day, the ECB reduced its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage point, thereby widening the interest-rate spread once more. It was very unpleasant to have to raise interest rates and accept a widening spread at a time when other central banks were lowering theirs to support the financial sector. The only way to interpret this was that something must be rotten in the state of Denmark! But we had no other choice. These interest-rate increases had no short-term impact on the krone. In the hours immediately after Danmarks Nationalbank’s announcements, the krone weakened further and intervention sales of foreign exchange were necessary. The interest-rate instrument did not have the desired effect. Few domestic counterparties bought kroner in response to the interest-rate increases.  On 15 October, the ECB introduced full allotment in its weekly main refinancing operations, and the pressure on the krone eased temporarily. Euro area banks were now able to obtain sufficient liquidity from the ECB, which was reflected in market spreads to the euro area. On 24 October, further capital outflows – driven by foreign investors – led Danmarks Nationalbank to raise interest rates further. Subsequently, the spread to the euro area was 1.75 percentage points, which was enough to make domestic insurance and pension companies in particular turn towards the Danish kroner once again. Issuance of CP The substantial intervention sales in October drained the foreign-exchange reserve. In previous crises, it had been possible immediately to increase the reserves by issuing short-term CP loans and later replacing these by longer-term loans if necessary. Experience from the autumn of 2008 showed that we, on the behalf of the government, could not issue sufficient CP at the peak of the crisis. Furthermore, it took quite a while before the government was able to raise longer-term foreign loans at an acceptable price. We did not want to borrow at a rate that signalled an urgent need for foreign exchange. The crisis confirmed the old saying that money is hardest to come by when you need it the most. By 15 October, the foreign-exchange reserve had been reduced to DKK 104 billion, the lowest level in ten years (Chart 6). How long would it take before the situation would begin to improve?  After 14 October, Danmarks Nationalbank was finally able to issue CP on behalf of the Danish government (Chart 7). This continued on an almost daily basis throughout the rest of 2008. Other initiatives We managed to keep our head above water, but this was not solely due to our own intervention and interest-rate increases. A number of other factors played an important role. 
BIS Review 35/2010 5 The shortage of euro and dollar liquidity, combined with dysfunctional financial markets  – notably the frozen interbank market – led the ECB and the Fed to establish swap lines with other central banks, including Danmarks Nationalbank. Via these swap lines, national central banks were able to offer euro and dollar liquidity to domestic banks.  Danmarks Nationalbank established a swap line with the Fed on 24 September 2008. The need for this facility was highlighted by the fact that volumes offered in our dollar auctions were drawn upon in full. The swap line with the Fed – totalling USD 15 billion – was fully exercised after three auctions. On 27 October 2008, Danmarks Nationalbank and the ECB established an equivalent swap line for 12 billion euro. Although this limit was not reached, the security of Danish banks in relation to euro funding was undoubtedly boosted. The swap facility has been very helpful in addressing the banks’ liquidity needs. It should be emphasised that this facility did not affect the foreign-exchange reserve or support the krone directly. It supported the krone indirectly by calming the market for FX swaps; and the ECB’s backing sent a strong positive signal to the market. Issuance of 30-year government bonds was another key factor. There was extensive demand in the Danish market for domestic bonds with longer maturities – particularly on the part of pension funds, which needed to hedge their long-term commitments. In November and December 2008, the Danish government took the extraordinary step of issuing 30-year bonds. As a result, Danish pension funds restructured their portfolios from foreign to domestic securities. This supported the krone. Last – but not least – it was equally important that the government, at short notice in early October 2008, decided to issue a guarantee for all deposits with and loans to Danish banks. It is impossible to say exactly what the impact of this measure, known as Bank Rescue Package I, was. Non-residents withdrew krone deposits totalling DKK 70 billion from Danish banks in October 2008. This package contributed strongly to keeping capital outflows during the crisis at a manageable level. Timing and determination were essential elements in terms of ensuring confidence in Danish banks. As I see it, the Danish banks would have been far worse off without this guarantee, and Danmarks Nationalbank’s ability to keep the krone stable might have been called into doubt. But while the government provided bank guarantees totalling around 2.5 times Denmark’s GDP, the potential claims on the foreign-exchange reserve increased. If a bank failed, the guarantee might be called in at short notice. If loans had been raised abroad, this would have affected the foreign exchange reserve. Therefore, the need to increase the reserve was even more important. The turning point in the krone crisis came in late October, when stabilisation of the krone market enabled us to buy back foreign exchange. Large scale buy-backs took place from 4 November 2008. Partial normalisation of the situation made it possible for us to follow suit when the ECB lowered its interest rates by 0.5 per cent on 6 November. In December, the monetary-policy spread gradually narrowed by a total of 0.75 percentage point. Conclusion (Chart 8) During 2009, Danmarks Nationalbank gradually reduced interest rates so that the spread to the euro area narrowed again. Today, the monetary- policy spread is only 5 basis points. But the actual money-market spread is around 50 basis points, mainly due to the substantial amount of excess liquidity in the Euro area. 
6 BIS Review 35/2010 Over the last year, Danmarks Nationalbank has built up the foreign exchange reserve to a much higher level than it used to be. It now exceeds DKK 400 billion. The dollar swap line with the Federal Reserve has expired.  So, in many ways the situation has normalised. But we have learnt what it means to be outside the euro area when you are a small economy with a fixed-exchange-rate regime. This should give food for thought.  We made it through. I will not ponder upon – at least not openly – what could have happened if speculation against the krone hadn’t subsided. We are still in a fixed exchange rate regime. As recent developments have shown, euro membership is not – and should not – be a guarantee for easy access to foreign borrowing. That depends on one’s ability to keep its own house in order. There is no substitute for sound economic policy inside or outside the euro. But when you are a small open economy and a storm of this magnitude sweeps through the markets – you would rather not have your own currency to worry about. Thank you for your attention.

BIS Review 35/2010 1 Philipp Hildebrand: The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy strategy in the financial crisis Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the University of St. Gallen, St. Gallen, 23 March 2010. The complete text in German can be found on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * To contain the financial crisis, central banks all over the world have chosen to take advantage of the room for manoeuvre afforded by their monetary policy strategy. The major central banks were only able to act in a flexible way – at least in part – due to their high degree of credibility with regard to their goal of pursuing price stability. The monetary policy strategy of the Swiss National Bank (SNB), too, has made it possible for the Governing Board to take conventional and unconventional measures to counter the crisis.  The SNB’s approach has proven viable in the crisis. But this does not mean that we can sit back now. We must first find ways to withdraw smoothly from the measures taken to contain the crisis. In addition, we need to be sure that the Swiss economy is back on a sustainable growth path. After all, the crisis has shown that imbalances in the global financial system can occur even in an environment of price stability and macroeconomic stability. The main way to counter imbalances in the financial system is through better regulation. Furthermore, central banks should seriously consider the question of whether they need to intervene when risks in the financial system increase as a result of strong credit growth and an easing of lending conditions. Credit aggregates are part of the SNB’s monetary policy strategy, and the National Bank monitors their development closely. However, the SNB’s main aim is and will continue to be the maintenance of price stability. 
Mario Draghi: “We need a European economic government” – interview in Handelsblatt Interview with Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, in Handelsblatt, Germany, conducted by Mr Hermann-Josef Knipper and Mrs Katharina Kort and published on 19 March 2010. *      *      * Handelsblatt: The whole Europe is worrying about the Greek crisis. What can Greeks do to sort out its financial problems ? Mr Draghi: I think the best and only thing they can do is to come out with a credible fiscal adjustment plan to be implemented promptly. The more delayed the commitments are, the less effective they are on reducing spreads on government bonds. The quicker they do it the better, and I should say they started doing. The Commission and the ECB, and the IMF to some extent, were involved as well. They must have been persuaded by the fiscal plan. Of course we have now to monitor its timely implementation because that is as important as designing it. Greeks have clearly seen there is a political price to pay and that it is unavoidable.  Handelsblatt: Are you confident in the Greek plans? Mr Draghi: Yes, but I would like to see its implementation. Handelsblatt: Do we need stricter rules? Mr Draghi: Yes, we obviously need stricter rules. It too early to specify which ones, but the Greek crisis has shown that this construction has to be made more resilient.  Handelsblatt: What have you in mind? Mr Draghi: My opinion does not differ from the one expressed by your Minister of Finance, Mr. Wolfgang Schäuble. The first thing to bear in mind is that we were able to create a pillar of stability with the euro and we have to do everything to preserve it. No matter what many critics say, we had low inflation, low financing costs and we have been amazingly protected by the world turbulence because we had the euro. So we have to preserve the stability and the credibility of this concept. the Greek crisis has shown that this construction has to be made more resilient because it has shown potential cracks. Handelsblatt: What can be done to make the euro stronger? Mr Draghi: First of all we should ask ourselves why are markets so nervous, not only with Greece but also with other countries. Incidentally the spreads have gone up also on AAA rated countries, not only on the A or AA rated countries. Markets are nervous because financial market conditions have enormously worsened, within the euro and outside the euro-area. But the other reason for markets to be nervous is that they do not see clear on how we collectively will get out of the exit strategies. The first thing we have to do is to have a clear, well defined, well-timed exit strategy from the high budget deficits. This is on top of our list of priorities. Handelsblatt: Which is the second priority? Mr Draghi: I think we have to extend the Stability and Growth Pact. So far, we have been able to have a monitoring mechanism and to some extent an enforcing mechanism of the balance sheet. We have to reinforce this concept and extend it to structural reforms. The reason why countries do not grow is because they have not undertaken structural reforms which facilitate growth. Handelsblatt: Do you have anything specific in mind? BIS Review 35/2010 1 
Mr Draghi: For the people who have been part of the creation of the stability and growth pact this discussion goes back to the late nineties and it was suggested at that time by several people, myself included, that we should do more in making pension reforms, market reforms, competition reforms and so forth. These are the reforms that make you grow in the end. At that time, some of the countries objected that these things were so engraved in their history and social texture that they would not accept to have the same discipline that they could accept in the budgetary area.  Handelsblatt: What are the implications in the present situation? Mr Draghi: I think it is now the time to make one step further. At least for the countries that are in the euro we need some mechanism that basically induces greater cooperation among governments and greater discipline. Ultimately, price stability, budgetary discipline and economic growth are the three pillars of financial stability. This refers to the medium term but we have to start working now because this will not be done in a month. Handelsblatt: What can be done in the short term? Mr Draghi: In the case of a fiscal crisis like the one in Greece, if we have a mechanism of identification and intervention that is clear, well-designed, markets will provide all the money that the countries want. What markets do not want is to be trapped in a confused muddled situation where they do not see clearly – a situation in which nobody would be ready to lend. If there is clarity and firmness of direction investors are there to lend the money. Only at the end of this, if we think we need some kind of emergency financial assistance like the one that Mr. Schäuble proposed, we can think about it. Handelsblatt: Do you agree with Minister Schäuble? Mr Draghi: The Minister rightly makes a point there. Now we have pooled monetary policy so it is considerably complex for the IFM dictate discipline to some country without saying anything on the monetary policy. Still, this is the other “macro-lever” of the IMF. Handelsblatt: Are you in favour of a European Monetary Fund? Mr Draghi: I think that if things are well done in laying out the monitoring and implementation mechanism probably you would not need a European monetary fund. We cannot think that the European fund would actually resolve the issue. I would not start from the financing of the crisis, but from the solution of the crisis. In the present market conditions, though, an emergency financing at rates higher than market rates, could only respond to temporary liquidity problems, but it would be wrong to make this mechanism the linchpin of our actions.  Handelsblatt: Do we need a new structure for the enforcement mechanism? If so, what kind of structure? Mr Draghi: Not so much a structure, but we need a concept very much along the way we had with the stability and growth pact, a concept to be endorsed by the governments.  Handelsblatt: Another Pact? Mr Draghi: Yes, another Pact. In the euro area we need a stronger economic governance providing for more coordinated structural reforms and more discipline.  Handelsblatt: Going back to the EMF, do you think it might send the wrong incentives? Mr Draghi: This danger exists and we must do whatever we can to consider it just an emergency measure exclusively for liquidity purposes. Nobody wants to think about the Fund as a mechanism that could resolve the crisis. Countries must not relay on the availability of a fund where we can draw on when having difficulties. I don’t think that Mr. Schäuble or anybody thinks this.  Handelsblatt: Would you recommend stricter rules for countries which do not respect the agreements? 2 BIS Review 35/2010 
Mr Draghi: Yes, we need stricter rules providing for an economic and political cost higher than it is the case today for any deviation from the rules or for the use of financial means not coming from the market.  Handelsblatt: Because of the financial crisis, rating agencies have been highly criticised. Do you think the Ecb should provide for its own ratings, as some have suggested? Mr Draghi: No, I do not think that would be right. The creation of an European rating agency could represent a solution if we have no trust in the American rating agencies or in any other. But this task should still not be entrusted to a central bank. Handelsblatt: Why have the experiences with credit rating agencies been so unsatisfying? Mr Draghi: Loopholes in regulations have allowed for conflicts of interest. One should wonder why the rating agencies did not see the big amount of dubious financial products being created between 2005 and 2008 and why they could not rate it properly. One of the answers is that the issuers were basically a few big investment banks. So, for some of these rating agencies it became clear that 90% of their business was done with these banks. This is exactly why they have been captured by the banks. Much has been done to change this, but there is still a lot do be done.  Handelsblatt: What are you thinking of? Mr Draghi: We have a project in the FSB now where we, as regulators, are looking for a way to reduce the importance of rating in regulation. We must look for alternatives and define other mechanisms.  Handelsblatt: But markets need ratings… Mr Draghi: Markets need rating. Investors want ratings. At the FSB we think there is the need for a better differentiation. One thing is a triple-A government bond, one other thing is a triple-A structured bond. It is always possible to have a structured bond in a way that it has a triple-A, even if the components are “junk”. So we must have ratings from the agencies which allow investors to distinguish one triple-A from another triple-A.  Handelsblatt: When are we going to find a solution? Which are the further steps in the reform of financial regulation? Mr Draghi: One of the two most important projects the FSB now has is the capital and liquidity regulation, the reform of Basel 2. Its implementation is scheduled at the end of 2012. Handelsblatt: Is it right to fear that Basel III might limit credit flows, prejudging economic recovery? Mr Draghi: First of all I hope that by then the recovery will be on its way. There is a risk but I think fears are exaggerated. Banks have done a lot already in raising capital. We should reach a globally accepted definition of capital. The Basel Committee and the FSB are working so that the timing chosen for the implementation of the new rules do not prejudge economic recovery. Handelsblatt: Are you confident that we will have a globally coordinated regulation? Lately we have seen a lot of tension between the EU and the US.  Mr Draghi: I think those tensions are being exaggerated. Many of the proposals now being publicly discussed, like the “Volcker rule” or a tax on banks in the US and the UK, have already been discussed by the FSB. Handelsblatt: You have been criticised for having worked at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank accused of having been involved in dubious transactions with Greece. What can you tell us about it? Mr Draghi: When I left the Italian Treasury, in 2001, we had no rules in Italy forbidding to take a position in an investment bank. Nevertheless, I went to Harvard and taught for six BIS Review 35/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 35/2010 months there. Then I entered Goldman Sachs. Since the beginning I made it clear that having worked 10 years with governments and government officials, it would be very embarrassing to ask them to do business with Goldman. I therefore insisted to develop my own clients in the private sector. And that’s what happened. I did that for about 3–4 years.  Handelsblatt: Any country among your clients? Mr Draghi: No, I have never made any transaction with any government. The reason is simple: I was too busy doing corporate investment banking with private clients. Handelsblatt: Have you ever been to Greece? Mr Draghi: I have never been to Greece for working reasons. Those transactions were done before my arrival at Goldman Sachs. There have been further transactions with Greece but I have never been involved. I would also like to point out that I was not deputy CEO, because that position does not exist at Goldman Sachs.  Handelsblatt: When you think now about Goldman Sachs and Greece, do you think it was a good idea for Goldman to help Greece mask its budget? Mr Draghi: That’s where the difference lies, the difference in purposes. One is debt management, the other one is debt concealment. That concealment is a very bad thing. If Greece had made a mess of their budget but not lied about the numbers, it would be much easier for them and for all of us. Handelsblatt: Which are the qualities of a good ECB president? Talking about monetary policy, do you consider yourself an “hawk”?  Mr Draghi: You should ask ECB observers if they think of me as a “dove”. You must always keep in mind price stability and monetary policy credibility and their crucial importance for growth.  
Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing before the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 22 March 2010. *      *      * Dear Madam Chair, Dear Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure to be with you today for the first regular hearing in 2010. Over the last few months, since our meeting in December 2009, the euro area economy as a whole has continued to gradually recover. But there are a number of issues, related to country and financial market developments, which have led to an intense discussion about the euro area and its functioning. This makes today’s discussion all the more timely. Wir sehen, welche großen Herausforderungen sich durch die Finanzkrise für die europäische Wirtschaftspolitik ergeben. Wir sehen auch, was es heißt, mit Wirtschafts- und Währungspolitik verantwortungsvoll umzugehen. Die Stabilität der gemeinsamen Währung ist die Verantwortung aller. Aujourd’hui, comme le veut la tradition, je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique, en portant une attention particulière à l’élimination progressive des mesures non conventionnelles prises lors de la période de crise. Ensuite, j’aborderai les deux sujets sur lesquels nous nous sommes mis d’accord concernant la politique budgétaire et les déséquilibres mondiaux. Economic and monetary developments As mentioned, since the previous hearing last December, economic and financial conditions have continued to improve, albeit only at a moderate pace. Economic activity is estimated to have increased by 0.1% from the third to the fourth quarter of last year. Recent information confirms that we can expect a moderate recovery in the current year. This is in line with the latest ECB staff projections. Also forecasts by other institutions confirm this expectation, with an annual growth rate round 1% in 2010, gaining pace in 2011. In the assessment by the Governing Council, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced, but as predicted already last year, the recovery is likely to be uneven across regions and sections and over time. High uncertainty continues to prevail. As regards price developments, we have continued to witness low inflation and low inflationary pressures over the recent months. Inflation in February 2010 stood at 0.9%. The outlook for inflation remains in line with price stability and risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced. Specifically, we expect inflation to stay around 1% in the near term, and to remain moderate over the policy-relevant horizon, in line with a relatively slow recovery in demand. Our monetary analysis continues to confirm the expectation of low inflationary pressures over the medium term, as reflected in weak expansion of money and credit. The growth of loans to enterprises in particular is anticipated to remain weak for some time ahead, while the annual growth rate of loans to households is positive and strengthening. These developments are still in line with regularities over past business cycles. We will monitor credit developments very closely in the months to come. While there is no clear evidence of credit constraints in the euro area as a whole, the situation differs across countries, sectors BIS Review 34/2010 1 
and company sizes. To a large extent, the weak growth of loans is due to the unprecedented severance of the 2009 recession. Indicators of inflation expectations over the medium to longer term remain firmly anchored in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. It is against this background that the Governing Council kept the level of key ECB interest rates unchanged earlier this month, regarding the current level as appropriate. The significant monetary impulse stemming from our interest rate reductions last year has spread to market interest rates, and the transmission to rates charged by banks to households and corporations has continued to perform well. This transmission needs to be seen in conjunction with the non-standard measures that the ECB has taken. These measures, notably the provision of full allotment of liquidity to banks with a one-year maturity against collateral, have been effective in providing funding to banks at favourable conditions, stabilising the money market, and fostering the pass-through of our interest rate reductions. Phasing out from non-standard measures In line with the above economic and monetary assessment, the Governing Council decided earlier this month to continue the gradual phasing out of some of the extraordinary measures. We do not wish to breed dependency. Banks are to take up their intermediation again and should have all appropriate incentives to do so. The 12-month operations have already been discontinued and the 6-month operation upcoming next week will be the last one. In addition, we now decided to re-introduce variable-rate tenders for the regular three-month operations as of late April. At the same time, we continue to provide the euro area banking system with unlimited access to central bank refinancing through shorter-term operations (with one-week and one-month maturity), for as long as needed and in any case until mid-October this year. This is to continue to support the credit provision to the euro area economy. Let me also say something on longer-term monetary policy issues , that I know is of interest to you, namely the relationship between monetary policy and asset prices. The financial crisis has revived the long-standing debate on the relationship between monetary policy and asset price bubbles. This debate is centred on a straightforward question: Should monetary policy aim to prevent the emergence of asset price bubbles? While this question has no simple answer, the ECB’s monetary policy strategy is an approach that is well suited to cope with the challenges brought about by unsustainable asset price developments. Our mandate is to maintain price stability over the medium term. Protracted, unsustainable financial trends or atypical swings in risk pricing in financial markets can pose risks to price stability down the road. The close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets implies that our monetary policy needs to detect such imbalances at an early stage and to respond to the implied, longer-term, risks to price stability in a timely and forward-looking manner, thereby contributing to financial stability. Our monetary analysis, which concentrates on the monitoring of money and credit, does just that. It is a strategic framework that embeds a degree of implicit “leaning against the wind” of excessive money, credit and asset price growth. Judgement is of course necessary in addressing asset price dynamics. The ECB has developed considerable expertise in the analysis of monetary and credit developments and their implications for risks to price stability, which has proved an invaluable asset also throughout the financial crisis. Fiscal policies in the euro area I would like to turn to fiscal policies now. As you know, financial sector support and the budgetary loosening in the context of the financial and economic crisis has – in most euro area countries – caused sizable fiscal imbalances. Meanwhile, most countries in the euro 2 BIS Review 34/2010 
area have exceeded the 3% reference value for the deficit ratio. Under these circumstances, the Stability and Growth Pact, which has been put in place to safeguard sound and sustainable fiscal positions, should be rigorously applied. The ECB calls to strengthen the governments’ commitment to strictly adhere to its provisions. National policy makers should give fiscal consolidation top priority in the context of ongoing economic recovery, and bring the deficit ratio to below 3% of GDP in line with the Ecofin recommendations. Based on the Stability Programme updates, governments appear to be on track this year, but further measures will be necessary in the coming years to correct excessive deficits within the set time horizon. As regards the composition of the fiscal adjustment, we welcome a focus on the expenditure side, because the size of the public sector has significantly increased in the crisis and because expenditure-based consolidation has proven to be more effective in the past. Governments can enhance the credibility of fiscal consolidation by strengthening national budgetary frameworks and implementing structural reforms to increase potential growth. In this context, I welcome the European Commission’s initiative for a Europe 2020 strategy and the stronger role of the Eurogroup in multilateral country surveillance which is overdue. At the same time, it is important that fiscal surveillance under the Pact remains a process of its own right and that the fundamental principles of the Treaty and the Pact are fully preserved. A successful exit from the strong fiscal expansion in the wake of the recent crisis will require ambitious measures and a strong political will regarding implementation. I am confident that European fiscal policy makers will succeed in restoring the sustainability of public finances. The adjustment efforts undertaken by the Irish government and more recently by the Greek government can be seen as promising first steps in the upcoming consolidation process. Policy responses to imbalances One of the main drivers of the financial crisis were the large global external imbalances. These imbalances implied massive capital inflows into deficit countries. Those inflows had partly been financed by the issuance of financial instruments, whose value was shattered in the turmoil. The imbalances reflected a lack of medium-term orientation towards stability and sustainability of macroeconomic policies in key deficit and surplus economies. The euro area did not contribute to the build-up in global imbalances. Its current account has remained close to balance over the years. The crisis has induced a partial reduction in global imbalances, but this correction appears to be largely cyclical. Some important structural factors that led to unsustainable imbalances remain largely in place. A risk that unsustainable global imbalances might re-emerge in the period ahead can therefore not be ruled out. Ruling it out would require rigorous policy adjustments in key deficit and surplus economies. The G20’s decision to create a process of mutual assessment of its members’ macroeconomic and structural policies is fundamental in this respect. To be successful, this process requires that peer surveillance is executed fairly and without complacency, and that the countries and economies concerned have the will and the operational capacity to change their domestic policies accordingly. These are necessary conditions to pave the way for a better functioning of the global economy. The euro area can enter this process from a positive standing, given its medium-term orientation in monetary, fiscal and macroeconomic policies. Let me conclude by recalling that macroeconomic imbalances are not only confined to the global level but also appear within the euro area. These imbalances remain a challenge, largely reflecting a lack of adjustment in a number of Member States. It remains indispensable that the countries concerned bring their monitoring of cost competitiveness indicators, their structural reforms, and their fiscal consolidation efforts more into line with the BIS Review 34/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 34/2010 principles and rules underlying the functioning of monetary union. This would allow euro area economies to reap fully the macroeconomic benefits of EMU. 
Axel A Weber: Challenges and opportunities for the competitiveness of EMU member states. The euro in the financial crisis – the German experience Presentation by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Copenhagen Business School, Copenhagen, 22 March 2010. *      *      * 1  Introduction Dear President Johann Ross (Copenhagen Business School),  dear Professor Peter Birch Sørensen (Chairman of the Economic Council, Denmark),  dear Gouverneur Christian Noyer and Governor Niels Bernstein,  ladies and gentlemen The global financial crisis that we have been experiencing since the autumn of 2007 has been a challenge for monetary and fiscal policy in nearly all industrialised countries. In addition, it called our regulatory regimes into question and caused a profound reform process to be initiated at the national, European and global level. With respect to European Monetary Union (EMU) the financial crisis has made clear just how important the euro is as a stabilising factor for the economies of its member states. Nonetheless, the challenges that lie ahead after the financial crisis and the economic downturn that accompanied it have not diminished. In particular, the financial crisis has led to a renewed debate about perceived imbalances in the euro area. This discussion is not new, as divergencies have been building up steadily since the launch of the euro. However, during the years preceding the financial crisis, the strong global economic expansion and the ongoing economic integration within the euro area partly masked the problems arising from these differential developments. As the financial crisis has called unsustainable business models into question and ruthlessly revealed the structural nature of the disparities, they have now moved centre stage. Taking the specific adjustment processes in a monetary union into account, we have to think about the conditions for sustainable growth in all euro-area economies and about how they can be achieved. In my following remarks, I will address these two aspects of the recent experiences within the euro area. First, the advantages of monetary union during the financial crisis. Second, the challenges that will have to be overcome in order to resolve the divergencies that have built up within the euro area. The current debate focuses on the differences in price competitiveness between EMU member states. However, in my view losses in competitiveness are not the root of the problem but rather a symptom of underlying unsustainable structural developments in some member states. Accordingly, the marked gains in price competitiveness the German economy has experienced have been a result of necessary structural reforms that were finally addressed in 2003 when domestic problems such as high structural unemployment, rising social security contributions and repeated excessive public deficits became more and more pressing. I will therefore take a closer look at this German experience trying to draw some conclusions for those countries that have lost competitiveness since the launch of the euro. 2  Euro – what have we gained? My positive assessment of the first ten years of monetary union results mainly from the fact that EMU clearly contributed to a favourable climate for economic growth within the euro area. Throughout the financial crisis, however, the euro proved to be far more than a growth factor for the euro area. In several respects it has stabilised the member economies. As market participants’ risk aversion increased, any additional risk would have depressed their BIS Review 34/2010 1 
propensity to invest. Therefore, the absence of exchange-rate risk within the euro area has represented an additional benefit during the crisis. More specifically, even though the effective exchange rate of the euro area rose sharply in the financial crisis – before falling again more recently – the euro prevented EMU member states from witnessing a scenario that Europe had experienced in former times, for example during the crisis of the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1992/93. At that time, the EMS had been exposed to a massive flight primarily into the D-Mark, which resulted in significant tensions among EMS currencies. This caused massive adjustment problems for those economies with appreciating currencies and inflationary pressure. Finally, the fact that banks within the euro area obtain short-term liquidity through the Eurosystem at the same terms and conditions has proved to be a great advantage during the financial crisis. It has significantly mitigated money market tensions and therefore served as a buffer against global financial market shocks. This has protected smaller economies especially. Otherwise some of them would probably have needed to make additional efforts to defend the credibility of their currencies, for example in the form of higher interest rates, interventions on the foreign exchange market or swap agreements with other central banks. 3  Economic divergencies – a challenge for EMU 3.1  Increasing intra-EMU heterogeneity The search for the causes of the financial crisis has intensified the discussion about global imbalances. What is often overlooked in this discussion is the fact that the euro area as a whole has an almost balanced current account. Consequently, the euro area has not contributed to the build-up of global imbalances. However, the economic divergencies within EMU do need addressing. One important reason for growing heterogeneity within the euro area is that the benefits of monetary union, in particular lower interest rates and the elimination of exchange rate risk, have not always been used wisely and have tempted some countries to live beyond their means: Too often inflowing capital did not reach the most productive sectors, and in some cases cheaper and easier access to funding led to excessive credit dynamics facilitating a rise in household and corporate debt and ultimately causing the real estate markets to overheat. In addition, fiscal policy often failed to use higher growth and lower interest rates to reduce deficits sufficiently. In economies with rigid or only partly flexible labour markets all these large expansionary stimuli resulted in accelerated wage increases that were well in excess of productivity growth, reducing price competitiveness and exports of domestic firms. Consequently, price competitiveness has diverged significantly from one euro-area member state to another since the introduction of the euro. Whereas a small group of countries, led by Germany, has achieved gains in price competitiveness, a larger group suffered significant losses, amongst others Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal. These underlying economic divergencies within the euro area are also reflected in persistent discrepancies in the current account positions of EMU member states. As long as a flourishing world economy and the growth dynamics within the euro area masked the associated problems, those developments were neglected. However, the financial crisis has revealed the unsustainability of this state and therefore increased awareness of the risks it involves. These risks imply depressed future growth prospects, disturbances in capital flows if markets doubt the sustainability of large external borrowing requirements as well as difficulties for monetary policy as a result of the growing heterogeneity of euro-area member states. Hence, correcting the structural problems that are at the root of the economic divergencies is one of the major challenges for the future: For example, domestic firms have to become more competitive by increasing productivity and keeping costs in check, labour market flexibility has to be increased in order to mobilise a larger share of the working age population and to facilitate reallocation of 2 BIS Review 34/2010 
workers to more profitable sectors. And structural deficits have to be brought down to sustainable levels by broadening the tax base or, preferably, cutting expenditure on government consumption and certain transfers.  Taking the current account as one indicator of the extent of these divergencies, one could get the impression that the financial crisis has halted the trend of growing heterogeneity within the monetary union, since current account positions have narrowed significantly in the years 2008 and 2009 (except for Italy and France). However, a closer look at the developments that underlie the changes in current account deficits shows that the reductions are still largely cyclical as they have been driven mainly by sharply falling imports rather than increasing export market shares. Hence, more profound and far-reaching changes have to be undertaken in countries that have lived beyond their means and thereby driven the divergencies within the euro area. In order to sketch how structural reforms can initiate the necessary adjustments and bring back heterogeneity within the euro area to a natural and sustainable level, I will now turn to the experience of Germany which has just undergone such an adjustment process.  3.2  The German experience This adjustment process is often perceived and portrayed as a significant improvement in price competitiveness due to ongoing wage moderation and major reforms on labour markets and in the social security system. However, this perception misses the point of what actually occurred in past years. The price competitiveness of the German economy had indeed declined dramatically in the years 1990 to 1995. During the reunification process, a number of domestic imbalances had built up and became apparent as of the mid-1990s. The most prominent were an oversized construction sector and strong wage and price increases despite a decline in average labour productivity owing to the inclusion of the eastern German economy. The German corporate sector reacted to this extremely unfavourable position on domestic and international markets by a painful, but eventually successful restructuring process including innovation, outsourcing, wage moderation as well as a balance sheet clean-up. It should be noted that these were market-based adjustments neither initiated nor managed by policy makers. However, what actually forced the German government to undertake a set of major reforms was a couple of intensifying domestic problems which depressed growth and increasingly constrained policy makers’ scope of action. In the economic downturn following the burst of the “New Economy” bubble in the early 2000s, persistently high unemployment peaking at more than 5 million people in 2005 as well as overburdened social security systems led to high fiscal deficits and a protracted period of only meagre GDP growth. Thus, adjustments in the areas of economic and social policy had become inevitable. Finally, in 2003, bold labour market reforms were introduced, which modernised the labour market structure and lowered the high employment threshold of economic growth. They were accompanied by fiscal consolidation and adjustments in the social security systems, in particular the pension system. These structural reforms have paved the way for further necessary market-based corrections, for example in wage setting and intra-plant working-time flexibility, to take place. They have been painful, but the economy was in much better shape afterwards. In my view, this is the core lesson that can be drawn from Germany’s experience. It is true that economic growth in Germany was unusually dependent on foreign trade during the last upswing between mid-2003 and early 2008, but we would be ill-advised to deduce from this experience the need for actively propping-up domestic demand, for example via encouraging higher negotiated wages. Rather, German exports were boosted by strong, but ultimately unsustainable global economic growth, whereas a pick-up in private demand once high unemployment started to decline was repeatedly burdened by exogenous forces. For BIS Review 34/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 34/2010 example, the need to cut excessive public deficits required a more restrictive stance of fiscal policy and the rapid rise in energy prices in 2008 absorbed the sizeable pick-up in nominal disposable income as the upswing was about to broaden to the domestic economy. What is therefore often neglected is that Germany was able to serve as an important buffer for world demand at the height of the financial crisis via its still robust private consumption as well as large fiscal stimulus packages. Looking ahead and bearing in mind the prospects for global economic growth as well as its regional breakdown, the German economy is unlikely to replicate the growth profile of the most recent upswing. In an external environment characterised by a less steep but hopefully healthier expansion, German enterprises will naturally have to focus more on the domestic market than before. Political coordination of this process which goes beyond the purpose of setting a framework for a market-induced, smooth reallocation of resources is neither necessary nor helpful. 4  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen,  the adjustment process the German economy underwent after reunification and during the first years of monetary union has shown that a market-based correction even of severe domestic structural problems is possible if the necessary reforms are addressed. In addition, the effort and inconvenience associated with those adjustments will pay off as they lead to strengthened economic conditions in the individual economies and the euro area as a whole. The EMU urgently needs such market-based adjustments as they are a prerequisite for economic divergencies to come to a halt, for sustainable economic growth within the euro area and thereby for the continuing success of the euro. 
Jean-Pierre Danthine: Calmer waters after the storm? Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event, Zurich, 18 March 2010. *      *      * I. Looking back We are emerging from a financial and economic crisis of major proportions. The extent of value destruction during the last two and a half years may well match the losses registered during the Great Depression. The lessons we will draw from this historical episode should leave us wiser. They will alter, in some fundamental ways, our understanding of finance and macroeconomics and hopefully, as well, the behaviour of economic participants – with a better designed economic system. Today I will begin by looking back and reviewing some of the main events that have occurred since the last Money Market Event which happened to coincide with the turning point of the financial crisis. I will then look forward and describe how the SNB perceives the immediate future. Finally I will briefly address two of the most pressing challenges confronting us – exiting from unconventional monetary policy measures and rethinking financial regulation.  Let me turn my attention to where it all started, that is, the US real estate sector. During a long period of low interest rates, low risk premia, subdued volatilities and general economic optimism, US house prices increased in an unprecedented wave to the end of 2006, at which point the bubble burst. The loss in housing-related wealth from cycle peak to trough is staggering, something of the order of USD 7 trillion.1 Part of these losses are paper losses, since not everyone entered the market at its peak and a portion of these losses have been absorbed by households themselves; the rest must be borne by financial intermediaries. To this day the worldwide write-downs by the financial sector, including, but not limited to recognised losses from the housing sector, are estimated at USD 1.7 trillion.2 However, we are still counting, as the latest results published by some of the world’s major financial institutes reveal. There have been many examples of real estate crises in the recent past, including one in Switzerland in the early nineties. What distinguishes the current crisis is its breadth and international character. These two characteristics are intimately related: the rapid expansion of subprime mortgages and the internationalisation of the mortgage-based financial instruments brought international capital to the US real estate sector. This capital helped inflate the property bubble in the first place; it also explains why the subsequent crisis turned into an international financial market event and then into a global economic crisis! A quick back-of-the-envelope calculation comes up with a figure for lost flow income of at least 10% of world GDP. We have escaped a new Great Depression, but in the end worldwide income losses have probably exceeded the income losses associated with the Great Depression.  Since the last Money Market Event a year ago, the international financial system has emerged from the brink of collapse, financial conditions have improved on a broad front and a hesitant economic recovery has been initiated. By and large, the trough on the financial front was reached in Q1 2009 while the economic low point was probably attained one or two quarters later. Exceptional fiscal and monetary policy measures contributed without doubt to these developments. Representative charts for last year show a strong recovery in equity markets, a return to calmer money markets, a decrease in credit spreads, and a return to                                                  1 Source: Fed Flow of Funds Statistics, Datastream. 2 Source: Bloomberg. BIS Review 33/2010 1 
more activity in corporate bond issuances. Noteworthy is the fact that, in contrast to developments in other countries, there was no credit crunch in Switzerland. In our country, as elsewhere, a very expansionary monetary policy has been a key element of the response to the crisis. From October 2008 to March 2009, the SNB carried out a massive reduction in the Libor target range, pursuing a de facto zero interest rate policy. As of March 2009, the SNB adopted measures termed “unconventional” in order to loosen the monetary reins further when there was no more room for interest rate reduction. These measures took three main distinct forms: longer-term repo transactions, purchases of bonds issued by domestic borrowers, and purchases of foreign currencies.  Today, viewed from an international perspective, the Swiss economy is in a relatively favourable position. GDP has been growing for two consecutive quarters. Inflation is back in positive territory but without excessive upward pressure. Fears of deflation, which constituted one of the major risks of the past year, have not yet disappeared but are receding. Employment is no longer falling and unemployment may be stabilising. The Swiss export sector was strongly hit by the crisis and is still fragile. Economic activity has been sustained by domestic consumption (both private and public) and by construction activity. Last year’s GDP growth, at –1.5%, constituted the worst performance for the Swiss economy since 1975. Yet this figure is considerably better than the corresponding figure for most developed economies. Let us spend a moment examining the remarkable fact that private consumption growth in Switzerland has remained positive throughout practically all stages of the downturn. Immigration and precaution are the two key words that explain this exceptional result (with a third contributing factor being the fact that disposable incomes have stayed high in real terms, owing to a strong pre-crisis growth performance and a job market more robust than might have been feared). The recent immigration has been a positive contribution to consumption. But even the per capita figure for consumption has not decreased during the crisis. This has been possible because, very much in a textbook fashion, Swiss consumers have been able, during times of crisis, to draw on savings that had been comfortably replenished before the storm arrived. This is not only exemplary, it is an important lesson we can learn from the crisis for use in the future, and it holds true not only for households but for companies and public entities as well. There are many ways to express this message, but allow me to refer to French classical literature and recall for you Jean de la Fontaine’s celebrated fable about the cricket and the ant: “La cigale et la fourmi”. In the fable, the cricket who had not accumulated surpluses during the plenteous summer days preceding the crisis, found herself “fort dépourvue quand la bise fut venue”, that is, she “found when the winter winds blew free, her cupboard bare as bare could be”. The fact that, in this situation, the ant of the fable was not eager to lend to the singing cricket lends further realism to the analogy.  II. Current environment and short-term prospects What now? We are not yet ashore and the relatively positive assessment of the previous paragraph does not reflect a definitive evaluation. First, private consumption could be less robust should conditions on the labour market improve less than currently anticipated or even deteriorate again. Here the main worry is the ability of the Swiss economy to quickly reabsorb the 60,000 individuals working on a short-time basis. Recently, developments have been encouraging. In turn, the situation of the labour market depends on the continued recovery of the 60% share of the economy that is geared to international markets. This view is confirmed by the apparent difference between the ongoing recoveries in the US and Switzerland. While in the case of the US economy, the recovery is at the moment essentially focused on larger firms with smaller ones probably suffering from restricted access to credit, in the Swiss case, any diverging trend between big and small firms is not of major importance. Rather, the difference is more accentuated for firms that are predominantly export-oriented as opposed to those oriented towards the internal market. On the export side, the ability of Swiss exporters to continue redirecting their efforts towards the more 2 BIS Review 33/2010 
dynamic regions of the world economy, in particular Emerging Asia may be a crucial test. This region is leading the world in terms of economic recovery from the crisis. It is clear here that the proponents of a reasonable version of the decoupling hypothesis are on the winning side of the intellectual debate.  On a global level, inflation pressures are expected to remain subdued in most economies. In advanced economies, headline inflation is expected to pick up from near neutral levels in 2009, but remain low in 2010. For Switzerland, the path of inflation in the short term will be largely dictated by recent movements in oil prices and associated base effects. Inflation will nevertheless remain positive throughout 2010. This follows a negative rate of 0.5% in 2009. Assuming that monetary policy remains unchanged, the SNB’s forecast show that inflation will reach 0.7% this year. The SNB’s forecasts also show that inflation will begin to increase again from the beginning of 2011, to reach 2% in the first half of 2012.  III. Policy challenges for the future 1. Exit strategies For the SNB, the return to normality does not pose any difficult conceptual problem. The unconventional measures developed to combat the current crisis have in part modified the nature of the liquidity created. Liquidity resulting from repos and currency swaps is temporary: it flows back automatically when transactions are not renewed. Liquidity created by acquiring foreign exchange and Swiss franc bonds is more permanent. The issuance of SNB Bills routinely practiced since October 2008 has given the SNB a tool that can play a central role in liquidity absorption. The next speaker, my colleague Dewet Moser, will concentrate on the more technical aspects of the exit strategy. Suffice it to say that the toolbox is available. It is not a question of how, only of when. On the timing issue, because of the long and variable lags between monetary policy decisions and their impact on inflation, the decision to start tightening is a difficult one. It is necessary to balance the risk of moving too soon, when the economy may not yet be fully able to withstand the move, against tightening too late and giving too much room to potential inflationary pressures. There is no magic recipe. All the more so because we are reasoning at the level of the aggregate economy, that is, in terms of an average. This means, in particular, that for some parts of the economy even being too late will feel as though it is too soon. What is certain is that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely without incurring inflation risks. Therefore, households and firms should prepare themselves for a return, sometime in the future, to a world of higher interest rates, with exchange rates being guided by market forces. This is the normal state of affairs, and all concerned should shake off bad habits learned in extraordinary times and remember that they are ultimately responsible for the long-run viability of their decisions and operations.  2. Safer financial system: regulation It is here that we have most to learn from recent events, and here that we must adapt. There is a lot that could be said. However, I will be modest and confine myself to putting forward three simple ideas that are becoming part of the general consensus, as outlined in the G20 and FSB agendas.  Firstly, it should not be a game of us (the central banks, the regulators, the government) versus them (the banks or their managers, the financial sector). What is at stake is the design of an economic system that is efficient, compatible with the rules of a market economy and favourable to value creation. One essential lesson of the financial crisis is that the system was not properly designed. There is nothing bad per se about speculation, high risk taking or even high levels of remuneration, provided the principals fully assume the consequences of their actions, and provided, in particular, that the tax payer remains out of the picture. It is clear that our financial system did not satisfy this requirement. In the BIS Review 33/2010 3 
advanced G20 countries, public-sector capital injections to the banking sector so far have been estimated at 3.4% of GDP!3 This is a lower bound for the risks assumed by the public sector; the latter may have been closer to 25% of GDP for the major western economies, according to a recent estimate by J.C. Trichet.4 There is absolutely no economic, let alone moral, justification for situations where individuals enjoy high levels of remuneration or high returns when times are good, while the public sector has to come to the rescue when times are bad. In an ideal world, it should now be the responsibility of the financial sector – rather than regulators – to come up with credible proposals for change. These proposals must inevitably imply that all the main players, in particular managers and creditors, have much more at stake than in the past. Depending on how creative we are in finding solutions, financial institutions will have to be smaller and less prone to risk taking. For managers, at the very least, this must mean bonuses being tied to the long-run performance of their firm. Logically, one could envisage going further. The first real source of asymmetry is the very principle of limited liability. Beyond a certain level of remuneration and risk taking, one should ideally envisage a system which mimics that of partnerships or full personal liability. The fact that this is probably too ambitious justifies more ad-hoc complementary forms of regulation. Shareholders have by and large paid their dues in the crisis, but creditors typically have not. This is the level at which there is most to gain in both correcting the incentives (ultra-high leverage should worry creditors first, and regulators only afterwards) and protecting tax payers. By definition banks rely a great deal on credit; it is conceptually clear that creditors should come into play before taxpayers when something goes wrong. This would naturally be the case via bankruptcy proceedings. If we cannot go that far because of the crucial role of banks and certain financial institutions, we must find other ways for creditors to step in before taxpayers are involved. This can be achieved through ways of anticipating part of bankruptcy outcomes (living wills) or/and through some form of automatic conversion of a significant proportion of bank debt into equity.  Secondly, these considerations address the financial stability issue only through the lens of individual institutions. We now know that this is not enough. Microprudence must be supplemented by macroprudence, i.e., a system design that encourages well-managed individual institutions to act, in particular at times of crisis, in ways that do not make life harder for other institutions under stress. The issue is clear, the perfect solution less obvious. At the moment, regulators are talking about dynamic provisioning or capital requirements conditional on the cycle phase. The key idea is that regulators may want to be more lenient in bad times so that individual institutions have more breathing room. If this is the case, the logical consequence is that the overall requirements (e.g. capital adequacy rules) should be tougher in good times. Of course Jean de la Fontaine would argue that this is simply good management and that regulation should be superfluous! Thirdly, it is important to realise that there is no perfect solution and no perfect design. This means that we need to be pragmatic and attack the problem from various angles. Some of the new regulation proposals are elegant and attractive because they go straight to the heart of the problem (convertible debt or contingent capital), others are less pretty (e.g. size requirements), but we should accept this state of affairs until we have a clearer intellectual picture of this major issue.  A final note on the issue of remuneration. There may or may not be some truth to the idea (not very popular at the moment) that the financial sector is a high contributor to national value creation, and that this explains the high level of remuneration in that sector. But bankers have some convincing to do and doing so requires being honest about the source of income: is it truly high productivity or is it leverage? It is my view that return and profit                                                  3 Source: IMF (2010), “Lessons and Policy Implications from the Global Financial Crisis “, IMF Working Paper No. 10/44. 4 Source: Jean-Claude Trichet, Interview with The Wall Street Journal, January 2010. 4 BIS Review 33/2010 
calculations should be made over the medium to long run and properly adjusted for risk and leverage. As an example: When returns-to-equity figures are used to boast about the efficiency of an institution they should be adjusted for leverage if the speaker does not want to be guilty of intellectual fraud.  IV. Conclusion We have lived through several months of intense turbulence in the national and international financial markets. The more violent storms that raged in 2008 and the first part of 2009 receded a little in the second half of 2009. A certain degree of calm has returned but the wind has not died down completely yet. The years ahead will be ones of transformation. A priority for fiscal as well as monetary policy will be a return to normality. Equally important will be to learn the right lessons from these turbulent times and to act firmly to address the shortcomings identified in the financial system.     BIS Review 33/2010 5

Andrew Sentance: Prospects for global economic recovery Speech by Mr Andrew Sentance, Member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, at the British Chambers of Commerce Annual Convention, London, 18 March 2010. *      *      * I would like to thank Michael Hume and Abi Hughes for research assistance and I am also grateful for helpful comments from other colleagues. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Bank of England or other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Over the three-and-a-half years I have spent so far on the Monetary Policy Committee, one of the things that has struck me most forcefully is the way in which the UK economy is so heavily influenced by international developments. The global financial crisis and the recession which resulted from it have highlighted that very clearly. But even before we felt the full force of the crisis in late 2008 and early 2009, UK inflation was pushed up to over 5% by a surge in global energy and commodity prices. And looking back over the whole history of the MPC since 1997, most of the shocks to UK growth and inflation that the Committee has had to worry about have had a significant international or global dimension.1 These global influences on the UK economy partly reflect our economic history. Flows of overseas trade, investment and finance have played a major part in shaping the development of the British economy, creating a highly international business and financial environment here in the UK. But links to the global economy have also been strengthened by globalisation, which has reinforced international linkages across the world economy as the global economic system has become more integrated and interdependent.2                                                   1  Key global economic disturbances over this period include the Asian crisis (1997/8), the bursting of the “dotcom” bubble followed by the impact of 9/11 and war in Afghanistan and Iraq (2001–3), and oil and commodity price volatility in the mid-2000s. 2  I have discussed the impact of globalisation in more detail in earlier speeches. See, for example,  “Monetary Policy in Turbulent Times” (21 April 2009) and “Energy and Environmental Challenges in the  New Global Economy” (21 September 2009), both available on the Bank of England website: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/speaker.htm#sentance. BIS Review 33/2010 1 
The performance of the global economy is therefore critical to the prospects for UK recovery. And it is therefore very encouraging that the global economy has bounced back strongly following the sharp contraction in output and trade in late 2008 and early 2009. As Chart 1 shows, the growth of world GDP in the second half of last year has returned to around its prerecession growth rate and world trade has also bounced back strongly. This recovery in the world economy appears to have continued into the early months of this year. For example, the volume of international air traffic, which is highly sensitive to world growth trends, was 6.4% up on a year ago in January 2010.3 Despite the gloomy headlines surrounding the release of the latest UK trade figures last week, the UK economy is benefiting from this revival in world trade and activity. The latest trade data show that since the second quarter of last year, the volume of UK goods exports, excluding oil and erratics, have risen 8.5%.4 This is equivalent to an annual growth rate of 15% – around three times the trend rate of UK export growth since the early 1990s.5 But imports have bounced back too, which is why the trade deficit is not shrinking at present. In the short-term that should not be a source of concern – rising imports at this stage of the cycle are usually a sign of a recovery in demand and a turnaround in the stock cycle. But over time, we should see rising exports helping to close the UK’s trade deficit. The very positive responses on export orders and confidence shown by a range of recent business surveys suggest that there is a significant further boost to our international trade performance on the way – supported by the competitiveness benefits of sterling’s depreciation since mid-2007. This bounceback in the world economy is much stronger than we might have expected a year ago.6 So what has been driving it? And how resilient might it prove to be? In my view, three main factors have been driving the recovery over the last year – a bounce back in business and consumer confidence, strong growth in Asia and other emerging markets, and the impact of policy stimulus. These three factors will also have a key bearing on future global economic prospects, and I will discuss them briefly in turn.  Recovery in confidence A key factor which plunged the world economy into recession was the massive shock to business and consumer confidence across all the major economies of the world when the global financial system appeared to be rocking and reeling in late 2008 and early 2009. Since then, confidence has gradually recovered as the financial system has stabilised and the shock waves from the traumatic events of eighteen months ago have subsided.                                                  3  See http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/economics/ for data compiled by the International Air Traffic Association (IATA). 4  The 8.5% increase relates to the seven-month period Q2 2009 to Nov–Jan 2010. 5  UK exports of goods and services grew in volume terms by 5.4% per annum from 1992 to 2007; exports of goods excluding oil and erratics increased by 4.5% over the same period. 6  This has been reflected in an upgrading of world growth forecasts for 2010. For example, the IMF forecast of GDP growth across the world economy this year has risen from 1.9% in April 2009 to 3.9% in its latest World Economic Outlook (January 2010). 2 BIS Review 33/2010 
 One indicator of this recovery in confidence is the performance of stock markets, reflecting an improving assessment of business prospects. As Chart 2 shows, equity markets in the UK and US have recovered by around 60% from their troughs about a year ago. Alongside this improvement in financial market confidence, business survey indicators have also been improving across the global economy. Chart 3 shows a composite measure of surveys of purchasing managers from the major world economies. The very negative readings of around a year ago have given way to responses which are consistent with rising activity and the expectation of future growth.  BIS Review 33/2010 3 
The natural momentum of a recovery is that, as growth continues and memories of the recession fade, both consumer and business confidence will continue to build. Over time, cutbacks in investment by firms and the deferral of major consumer purchases will begin to reverse. As a result, we should expect both consumer and investment demand to gradually strengthen as long as new shocks to confidence do not emerge.  Growth in Asia and emerging markets Alongside this general recovery in confidence, a key engine of the world recovery has been a strong rebound in Asia and many other emerging market economies. As Chart 4 shows, forecasts for growth this year and next in the major Asian markets – and in developing and emerging market economies as a whole – are for a continuation of the healthy growth rates seen in these economies throughout the past decade. There are good grounds for believing that this strong performance in Asia and other emerging markets will continue to be an engine of world economic growth as the recovery continues. First, there are healthy supply-side fundamentals in the economies of Asia – a large potential labour supply, with the region accounting for about half of the world’s population, and scope for continuing productivity catch-up with the more advanced economies. Second, governments in Asia and many other emerging market economies remain committed to market-oriented policies and continued integration into the world trading system, which has proved an important underpinning for rapid growth and development in the past.7 Third, public and private finances are generally in good shape. The banks and other financial institutions in the major Asian economies were not directly affected by the crisis in the same way as the financial sector in the US and Europe. Government finances have also started from a stronger position, which means that fiscal policies can continue to support private sector demand and there is much less need for serious fiscal retrenchment as a result.                                                  7  See, for example, The East Asian Miracle: Economic Growth and Public Policy, World Bank, 1993. 4 BIS Review 33/2010 
These strong demand and supply-side fundamentals help to mitigate concerns that the impetus from Asia and emerging markets will quickly fizzle out, or that it will be undermined by the re-emergence of global imbalances. And the increasing importance of Asia in the world economy means it is now a material influence on the growth of the world economy. As Chart 5 shows, the seven largest economies in the Asia-Pacific region, including India, China, Japan and Australia, now account for close to a quarter of world GDP – not far short of the contribution to world GDP from the United States and the European Union.  Indeed, there is a worry that growth in Asia and other emerging markets may prove too strong, fuelling the growth of asset prices and putting upward pressure on global energy and commodity prices. As Chart 6 shows – the strong growth in developing economies and emerging markets in the mid-2000s was associated with significant upward pressure and volatility of oil, food and metal prices.  BIS Review 33/2010 5 
Recent movements of the oil price have been very sensitive to news about the pace of global growth, and commodity prices have picked up more generally as growth has returned to the world economy. If the momentum of the global recovery is sustained, there is a risk of further upward price pressure from this direction, with a knock-on impact on broader measures of inflation around the world. The role of economic policy The third engine of growth in the world economy at present is the stimulus provided by a range of policy measures. Economic policies have played a role in stabilising world economic and financial conditions in three ways: first, by direct interventions to underpin the stability of banks and the financial system more generally in many economies; second, through stimulatory fiscal policies; and third, through supportive monetary policies – very low interest rates and direct injections of money to support demand in a low interest rate climate, such as the MPC’s policy of “Quantitative Easing”. However, the current level of stimulus from monetary and fiscal policy was designed to turn around economies in the wake of the traumas we experienced 12–18 months ago. As confidence builds and private spending recovers, it is likely to be appropriate to gradually withdraw at least some of this policy support for demand, without jeopardising growth prospects. The need to re-adjust economic policy is most obvious on the fiscal side, where deficits are very high by historical standards, particularly in the US, Europe and Japan – as Chart 7 shows. These large deficits reflect the important role that public spending and tax policies have played worldwide in stabilising economic conditions during the recession. But to ensure sustainable public finances over the medium-term, these budget gaps will need to be closed over the recovery.  In many countries, policy-makers are rightly concerned about the negative consequences for demand of tightening fiscal policy too quickly and abruptly while the recovery is still fragile. But a tightening of fiscal policy which is pursued as part of a longer-term, credible and well worked-out plan is much less likely to have such negative demand-side effects, and may have offsetting benefits for the supply-side performance of the economy. 6 BIS Review 33/2010 
Progress in putting public finances on a sounder footing can increase confidence and reduce uncertainty about future economic prospects, providing a much better climate for a recovery in private sector demand. It can also support the supply-side performance of the economy by helping firms and individuals plan for the longer term. The effects of deficit reduction on financial markets should also be positive for private sector demand. Long-term interest rates are likely to be lower in a world in which government deficits are being reined in, and the risk of destabilising financial market movements is also reduced. Again, this is likely to provide a much better climate for private sector investment and long-term spending and planning more generally. An additional mechanism through which the negative demand-side consequences of fiscal tightening can be offset is by maintaining a relatively loose or relaxed monetary policy. So the other arm of withdrawing policy stimulus – a tightening of monetary policy – needs to take into account the potential impact of deficit reductions on demand, activity and inflation. What this implies for the monetary stance and the level of interest rates will inevitably vary between countries and regions as different monetary authorities make their own judgements about the pace and extent of tightening appropriate to their own circumstances. Indeed, some monetary authorities in the Asia-Pacific region, where growth has been stronger and inflationary worries greater, have already begun to tighten policy. Elsewhere, in the UK and many other major economies, the current settings of monetary policy still reflect the aggressive loosening of policy to counter the severe downside risks of the recession a year ago. As these downside risks recede and recovery becomes more firmly established, it will be important to reassess how much of that stimulus is still needed to keep the economy on a steady course consistent with low inflation. Conclusion The turnaround in the global economy over the last year has been quite impressive, given the scale of the shocks from the financial crisis. That should give us grounds for encouragement that continued growth in the global economy will provide a supportive backdrop for recovery in the UK – even if some of our important markets, such as the economies of the euro area, may be turning around more slowly. Indeed, the IMF’s medium-term forecasts for the world economy over the next five years point to stronger global growth than we experienced in previous recoveries from the major recessions in the 1980s and 1990s, as Chart 8 shows.  BIS Review 33/2010 7 
8 BIS Review 33/2010 But there are also many uncertainties affecting the current outlook for the global economy and I would highlight four key influences which will shape the recovery which does unfold over the next few years. First, I have argued that an improvement in business and consumer confidence has been a key ingredient in the economic turnaround so far. And in the absence of further shocks to the global economic system, we should expect confidence among firms and households to continue to recover, supporting the growth of private sector spending and helping the recovery to build momentum. But given our experience in recent times, we cannot rule out new shocks which could set back recovery. Second, a major financial adjustment is taking place in the major economies of Europe and the United States as banks adjust their lending behaviour and seek to rebuild their balance sheets. This adjustment will continue to dampen the recovery in demand on both sides of the Atlantic too some degree, though its impact should lessen as the process of financial repair and rebuilding progresses. Third, world growth in the recovery so far has been particularly strongly driven by the performance of Asia and other emerging markets, and their dynamism has to a large extent offset slower growth elsewhere. In my view this is not a flash in the pan, but a structural feature of the world economy that we are now living in, and we should expect a continuing impetus to global growth from this direction. However, as we saw in the mid-2000s, there is also the associated risk of upward pressure on inflation from global energy and other commodity prices, if the momentum of world growth becomes too strong. Fourth, the high degree of stimulus provided by fiscal and monetary policy to combat the recession will need to be withdrawn over a period of time. Returning budget deficits to a more sustainable level will require a prolonged tightening of fiscal policy in many countries, including the UK. Monetary policy can provide an offset by continuing to support the growth of private spending – though the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus will need to be continually reassessed in the light of the progress of the recovery at home and abroad and its impact on inflationary pressures. Given the turbulence we have seen in the major economies of the world over the last two years, it is very natural to worry about setbacks to the recovery, both in the UK and overseas. In the past, economic recoveries have not been smooth and linear. So we should expect to see some variability in growth rates, both at home and abroad, as this recovery develops. However, looking through this data volatility, there are also good grounds for expecting the growth of the world economy to continue to provide a healthy support to the UK’s economic recovery over the years ahead. And, over time, that is likely to bring a different set of policy challenges to the ones we have been facing over the course of the recession. 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Strengthening the European Union’s framework for crisis management Opening statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the European Commission Conference “Building a Crisis Management Framework for the Internal Market”, Brussels, 19 March 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission for inviting me to today’s conference. I trust that the discussion will help to identify avenues that will strengthen the European Union’s framework for crisis management and resolution for the years to come. The evolving crisis Reflecting on the crisis from today’s perspective, I would say that what is now called “the crisis” is a deeply evolving phenomenon. It evolved from a crisis of liquidity into a full-scale crisis of banking and finance, and then into a global financial and economic crisis. And as we are all well aware, a great deal of attention is currently focused on fiscal policy and public finances. At the same time, policy-makers around the world have so far fended off a number of threats: a global meltdown of finance, a downward spiralling of the economy and a massive increase in global levels of unemployment. Fundamentally, this is a crisis of valuation. But it is also a crisis that has led us, and continues to lead us, to fundamental re-evaluation. We have had to re-evaluate our understanding of the nature of risk of major market disruptions. We have had to re-evaluate the potential responses in terms of the implementation of monetary policy and the effectiveness of fiscal policy. And as citizens and policy-makers, we have to re-evaluate our understanding of the role of finance in our economies and our societies. In particular, we must consider fundamental questions about the relative importance and limits of the pure financial “game” in markets, about the potential abuse of market power, and, most importantly, about the function of the financial sector in the broader economy. In my view there is a clear litmus test for this function: whether or not finance serves the real economy. Financial reform therefore must ensure that finance is properly reconnected with the real economy. Reform needs to go beyond the banking sector on which so much attention has been focused. We also have to look very closely at non-bank financial institutions and at the set-up and functioning of financial markets. Financial markets are not always efficient. They are also not always broad, liquid and representing a fair competition of views and positions. Quite often, specific market segments can be oligopolistic, dominated by a few large actors. In such oligopolistic markets, information handling is particularly problematic, as views by dominant actors can evolve into fashions and set off trends that, through herding, move valuations out of line with what is warranted by medium-term fundamentals. As we now all recognise, if left on its own, finance has the potential to spiral out of control, for example through leverage cycles, triggering financial disruption, wealth destruction and economic hardship for our people. BIS Review 33/2010 1 
Therefore, one of the greatest challenges for economics and public policy at this time is to restore financial and economic stability, to rebuild confidence in the prospects for our economies and to improve the future functioning of financial systems. * * * The main agenda for today is what progress we can make in building a crisis management framework for our financial system at the European level. I will make some remarks on that key issue in a moment. But first I would like to reflect on what we have learned from the crisis in terms of the fundamental issue of systemic risk. Systemic risk A pre-condition for meeting the challenges of crisis prevention and crisis management is a deep understanding of the nature of systemic risk. The financial crisis has been revealing in many respects. It has revealed the scale of the potential fallout from the failure of large financial institutions. It has revealed the fragility of the financial system to features and trends that cut across institutions, markets and infrastructures. And it has illustrated the amplitude of the consequences of the adverse feedback loop between the financial system and the real economy. All three elements I have just described are key features of systemic risk: first, contagion; second, the build-up of financial imbalances and unsustainable trends within and across the financial system; and third, the close links with the real economy and the potential for strong feedback effects. To identify sources of systemic risk and recommend remedial action will be the task of macroprudential supervision in the EU, and the cross-border crisis management framework will help to handle large and complex financial intermediaries whose disorderly failure could pose systemic risks. A crisis management framework The national legal and institutional arrangements in a number of Member States have sought to improve the framework for prudential supervision and financial stability. We at the European Central Bank have supported such improvements. One key remaining issue is to accompany the greater interdependencies between national financial systems and thereby bolster the process of EU financial integration that is so desirable from a welfare point of view. This requires appropriate action at EU level to address the possible systemic impact of failing cross-border financial institutions. The ECB therefore fully supports the Commission in its initiatives to develop an EU-wide resolution framework and remove obstacles to effective crisis management pertaining to EU cross-border financial institutions. The Commission has suggested a very useful classification of the main issues under discussion into three areas: early intervention by supervisors; bank resolution; and insolvency proceedings. Let me devote a few words to each of them. First, in the area of early intervention the enhancement of cooperation among supervisory authorities is important, when they address an ailing cross-border financial institution. It can be improved by achieving convergence as regards a minimum set of tools available to the supervisory authorities involved. This may require also a common terminology as regards for instance the types of reorganisation measures to be used for financial institutions. 2 BIS Review 33/2010 
Second, as regards bank resolution, a priority is to pursue an enhanced and more coherent framework for the action of supervisory and resolution authorities. To avoid moral hazard, authorities should be ready to intervene with appropriate actions to contain the possible impact on financial stability and, where appropriate, ensure an orderly winding-up of the affected financial institution. In the Single Market, efforts should be made to facilitate coordination of the actions of national authorities involved in the resolution of a cross-border banking or financial group. Over the medium term, it would be helpful to achieve closer institutional convergence, with an enhanced role for the authorities within the resolution process, by recognising in particular their leading role in the administration of ailing financial institutions, in full respect of the due role of the judicial system. Third, as regards insolvency proceedings, new initiatives are required to promote further harmonization at the EU level. Today, national legal regimes are still diverse in terms of the rules and procedures that apply. It is recognised that harmonization at EU level may be difficult to achieve, but it should be underlined that it is key in any crisis resolution. Therefore, utmost efforts should be devoted to assessing outstanding problems and identifying possible ways forward. The ECB strongly supports the recent establishment by the Commission of a group of experts to pursue this aim. There is one central challenge to all crisis management frameworks and this is speed. The rapidity of unfolding developments is one of the greatest challenges for policy makers. And even though financial crises are by no means new phenomena, the speed of their transmission has accelerated tremendously over the past few decades. The unfolding of the sovereign debt crises in the 1980’s occurred over the course of years, the Asian Financial crisis developed, at its peak, over months. And last intensification of the present crisis, starting in September 2008, has spread around the globe in the course of half-days. Many factors have contributed to this acceleration, including the process of global financial integration, the increasing leverage in institutions, the technological advancements that allow for an instantaneous transmission of information world-wide and the accumulation over a long period of time of unsustainable global imbalances. Hence, a key message for all crisis management frameworks is that they need to be able to cope with the speed of which financial developments can unfold. The role of infrastructures  Policy action should not concern only banks but also the system as a whole, in particular addressing market functioning, including those of CDS. The current reflections at international level include also initiatives aimed at strengthening the core financial infrastructures and markets. Indeed, it is essential that conditions are in place to ensure that the financial system is able to withstand any possible shock and that financial infrastructures are strengthened to reduce the risk of contagion. Moreover, regulators have to ensure that financial market participants are behaving in full compliance with the rules and that no additional source of risks would derive from improper behaviour. In this context, attention has been attracted at the current juncture by the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) market. I would like to highlight the importance that certain financial instruments, which were introduced in consideration of their positive effects for the hedging of risks, should not be misused in a speculative manner. I share the consensus at global level that regulators should be equipped with appropriate tools to be able to investigate and act in an effective and coordinated manner. We need more transparency in CDS markets, and so do investors. BIS Review 33/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 33/2010 Transparency of markets is a public good. Authorities must be able to gather information, to assess possible risks for financial stability and detect possible improper conduct. In this respect, a key priority in terms of enhancing the resilience of the CDS markets is the establishment of central counterparty facilities. Such CCPs will help, in particular, to diversify and share risk exposures and their margining procedures will reduce the incentive to take excessive risks. Moreover, CCPs will deliver more of the much needed transparency for all parties involved. Conclusions The defining characteristic of any financial crisis is a collapse of confidence. The defining characteristic of the current crisis was a loss of confidence that seemed to permeate the whole world and almost instantaneously. At the height of the crisis – when irrational exuberance had turned into excessive pessimism – I repeatedly stated that regaining confidence was of the essence. Since then, confidence in the short term has been restored, not least because of bold and courageous policy actions around the globe. Going forward, we need to strengthen longer-term confidence, and that requires policy frameworks that will be robust against future challenges. That is the agenda on which I know we all plan to make some progress today. Thank you for your attention. 
Petar Goshev: Alleviating the negative effects of the financial crisis Welcome address by Mr Petar Goshev, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the World Bank event, Skopje, 15 March 2010. *      *      * Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, It is my honor to give a welcome address at this important World Bank event that it is taking place at a critical transitional stage when it seems that the strongest impact of the severest crisis since the Great Depression is behind us and the global economy is beginning to grow again. Still, although we believe the worst is behind us, the global crisis has had strong negative effects that will continue to be felt in the years to come. Because of that, the efforts of the national authorities and international financial institutions for mitigating the negative effects have to continue. In this regard, the enhanced role of the international financial institutions, including the World Bank, is vital. The economic, social and human implications of the global crisis have further emphasized the World Bank’s mission of eliminating poverty, enhancing growth and providing inclusive and sustainable development. Achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as a set of priorities for the World Bank, is becoming more challenging. As stated in the World Bank Annual Report 2009 “targets that it would have been difficult to reach even before the crisis are now considered implausible, and a real risks exists that the financial and economic crisis that begun in United States may develop into a humanitarian, political, and security catastrophe in the world’s most vulnerable regions.” The ECA Region was the hardest hit region by the global crisis. The decline of external demand, unfavorable terms of trade, decline in capital flows, as well as spillover effects to the domestic demand resulted in a fall of region’s GDP in 2009 of about 6%. With the real sector of the economy contracting and financial flows being constrained, unemployment and poverty have risen. Although all countries in the region faced with challenges during this turbulent time, still the crisis has had a disproportionate impact on the vulnerable in the less developed countries calling for bigger assistance to mitigate social impact.  The World Banks’ assistance was of a paramount importance in the past and will continue to be. It is not only about the financial support, but the support and guidance in implementing structural reforms. The mix of the World Bank programs aimed at creating broader based growth, efficient public sector and social protection, has yielded in decrease of the poor or vulnerable population in the region (18% of the total population has exited this group, since 1999).1 The region has grown quite rapidly, reaping the benefits of increased productivity, to a large extent being explained by the restructuring of the enterprises, technological improvements, enhanced infrastructure and investments in human resources. The cross regional comparison indicates that the ECA region is a leader in terms of the GNI per capita. What is even more important is the sharp growth of the GNI per capita from 6.265 current international $ in 2000 to 12.229 current international $ in 2008, thus giving the region a feature of a leader in improving living standards. However, the region is quite a diverse with GNI per capita ranging from 1860 current international $ in Tajikistan to 18420 current international $ in Croatia. This points to the fact that there are big disparities that need to be tackled to speed up the process of convergence which will mean less political and social tensions, less poor and homeless people, and less desperate migrations conducive to expression to different sorts of                                                  1  The World Bank Annual Report, 2009.

prejudices and frustrations. For many subregions the role of the World Bank is of a crucial importance, in particular for the Western Balkan, which is heavily lagging behind the leading countries in the region, faced with the problems of undeveloped infrastructure, poor health care systems, high unemployment and socially desperate people, i.e., faced with different forms of dehumanization of the living standards, including problems of climate change. Some parts of the subregion sometimes have problems with floods, but in many parts there is permanent lack of even drinking water.  Macedonia’s track record within the relations with the World Bank, can be assessed as quite successful. The World Bank has been one of the most important partners in the process of designing and implementing important structural reforms. The strong focus of the World Bank programs on the financial and the enterprise sectors, public administration, and business environment, has proved to be an important trigger and contributor to the productivity gains and real convergence of the economy.  Personally, I am deeply grateful to the World Bank and the IMF for the contribution they have made in overcoming our existential problems. It is my personal opinion, however, that our need for the cooperation with and support of the World Bank is more than necessary. We have made some progress, but we have also encountered a lot of problems. The global crisis emphasized a number of structural issues that are bottleneck for the growth of the Macedonian economy. A comparative analysis shows that Macedonia has pretty low level of investments (on average about 15% of GDP during 1997–2007). Thus, further support which will lead to higher investments and higher stock of capital will play an important role for the long-term growth. We substantially lag behind those we want to keep up with. The unemployment rate is still staggering (32.4%). Income per capita is only half of the highest GNI in the group, or only 33% of the average GDP per capita (PPP terms) of the 27 EU countries. We have a strong need of funds and permanent technical assistance in order to continue with and accelerate our structural reforms. The Greek example is a newest lesson. European and other funds, without all the painful and grave structural reforms, could not protect the country from facing the present crisis. However, it seems that, without structural reforms, they just boost the illusion.  The recent crisis has highlighted the need for the international financial institutions to have adequate level of resources and flexible, innovative and swift technical infrastructure. It is a prerequisite for a well targeted, timely, coordinated and efficient response to global shocks. The strong increase of IBRD disbursements, policy based lending and advisory services in 2009, the dominance of social protections programs, on the background of the social implications of the crisis, pinpoint the rapid and well targeted adjustments in the lending policy and expertise provided by the World Bank. The share of the World Bank financial support to the region in the total WB financing in 2009 rose to 20% (compared to the average of 16% for the previous three years). Significant weight was put on the enhanced social protection, regulation adjustment for the purpose of trade promotion, financial sector reforms and improved governance. Dear guests, Let me once more repeat that looking forward, the role of the World Bank becomes even more pronounced. Unprecedented policy support has yielded in tangible results reflected in improved global financial conditions and improved economic prospects. However, financial conditions are far from normal and growth prospects are highly uncertain and dependent on a policy support. The fiscal room has substantially narrowed and access to private financing is uncertain amidst high budget deficits and rising public debt.   To be able to respond to the demand for its services a capital increase and reconsidering priorities in the region seems inevitable. Although current situation calls for immediate assistance to protect poor and vulnerable people from the hardship they are faced with, the support in implementing structural reforms is of a vital importance. Structural reforms should not stall as they are crucial for paving a way for long-term sustainable growth 2 BIS Review 32/2010 
BIS Review 32/2010 3 and higher living standards, which is one of the main missions of the World Bank. Financial and technical assistance by the World Bank will play a key role in this process. Rising unemployment and growth in poverty asks for more “aggressive” role when it comes to social issues. But, also supporting reforms aimed at improving competitiveness, as well as addressing the issue of “climate change” should be priority on the agenda. Given the diversity of ECA region, assistance tailored to the specifics of the different groups within the region, remains important.   It is my personal opinion that the World Bank should increase its contribution to the accomplishment of global financial stability. It is rare to find another institution with such an experience. Preservation of global financial stability proved to be an issue of utmost importance to both the growth and the fight against poverty. Basel II has been definitively transforming into Basel III. There is a lot of work to be done to promote the micro-prudent and the macro-prudent frameworks. World Bank’s contribution through its participation in FSB and other international bodies and its cooperation with countries which use its financial and technical assistance is indispensable.  I will finish my address with quoting the leaders of the Group of Twenty from the meeting in London, 2009: “We start from the belief that prosperity is indivisible; that growth to be sustained, has to be shared; and that our global plan for recovery must have at its heart the needs and jobs of hard-working families, not just in developed countries but in emerging markets and the poorest countries of the world, too; and must reflect the interest not just of today’s population, but of future generations, too.” Thank you for your attention and I wish you a fruitful discussion and a pleasant stay in Skopje. 
Lars E O Svensson: Assessment of monetary policy in Sweden in 2009 Speech by Prof Lars E O Svensson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Centre for Business and Policy Studies (SNS), Stockholm, 18 March 2010. *      *      * Carl Andreas Claussen and Gabriela Guibourg have contributed to this speech. Assessments of monetary policy are important for several reasons. First, because the Riksbank has had an independent position in relation to the Riksdag and the government since 1999. This means, for instance, that the Executive Board makes the monetary policy decisions without seeking or taking instructions. The Riksbank’s independence gives its governors a great deal of power. It is therefore also important that the activities of the Riksbank can be monitored and assessed and that the governors can be called to account. A high level of transparency and regular assessments are also necessary to maintain the legitimacy of the Riksbank’s activities. Second, regular assessments also help to ensure that the Riksbank can develop its monetary policy analysis in the best possible way.  Every year, the Riksdag Committee on Finance examines and assesses the monetary policy conducted by the Riksbank during the preceding years. The Riksbank compiles and publishes material for this assessment. We published such material just a few days ago. The main message in this material is that the Riksbank responded to the crisis by taking forceful measures. The repo rate was cut to almost zero and the Riksbank announced its intention to let the repo rate remain at this level for a relatively long period of time. The turbulence on the financial markets also meant that monetary policy had less of an impact than normal. The Riksbank responded to this by complementing monetary policy with extensive lending to the banks. In this way, monetary policy has helped to dampen the fall in production and employment. It has also helped to keep inflation in line with the target in the longer term.  This is what I intend to talk about today. First, however, I would like to say a few words about some of the principles that are important when assessing monetary policy.  What should we consider when we assess monetary policy?  When can one say that the monetary policy conducted over the past year has been good? The answer to this question naturally depends on what the target for monetary policy is.  The Riksbank has an explicit inflation target according to which the annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) should be 2 per cent. As monetary policy acts with a time lag, it should be based on forecasts. The Riksbank’s forecasts are based on the assumption that the repo rate – the Riksbank’s policy rate – will develop in such a way that monetary policy can be regarded as well-balanced. In the normal case, a well-balanced monetary policy means that the inflation forecast is close to the inflation target a couple of years ahead at the same time as the forecast for inflation and the real economy (production, employment and unemployment) does not fluctuate excessively. It thus a question of finding an appropriate balance between stabilising inflation and stabilising the real economy and resource utilisation. The Riksbank therefore conducts what is generally referred to as flexible inflation targeting.  One might think that it should be enough to simply compare the outcome for inflation with the inflation target when assessing monetary policy. But it is not that simple, for two reasons. The first is that it takes time for changes in the repo rate to have an effect on inflation and the real economy. During this period of time, shocks may occur that can push the economy in a different direction than was forecast. The monetary policy adopted may have been right, but the Riksbank is unlucky and unforeseen shocks lead to inflation deviating from the target. BIS Review 32/2010 1 
The monetary policy adopted may have been wrong, but the Riksbank is lucky and unforeseen shocks nevertheless lead to inflation hitting the target.  The second is that flexible inflation targeting means that the Riksbank strives not only to stabilise inflation around the inflation target but also to stabilise resource utilisation around a normal level. This can sometimes entail a difficult balancing act. Shocks may, for example, occur that make it difficult to quickly bring inflation to the target without creating major fluctuations in the real economy. One may then choose to let the outcome for inflation deviate from the target. This deviation is then deliberate and represents part of a compromise between stabilising inflation and stabilising resource utilisation.  So, how should one assess monetary policy? Two approaches can be used. The first is to assess monetary policy a couple of years after the monetary decisions concerned, so that inflation and the real economy have had time to react to the monetary policy measures, and to use all the information available at the time of the assessment, that is including the information that has become available after the decision was made. This is, in other words, an assessment after the fact, or what can be called an assessment ex post. Although it may be very interesting to analyse the shocks that occurred after the monetary policy decisions were made, it is practically self-evident that monetary policy could have been better if the shocks that occurred later had been known at the time the decisions were made. An assessment after the fact is not therefore necessarily the most relevant form of assessment.  A more relevant approach is to put ourselves in the position of the decision makers at the time the decision was made and to try to assess the decision given the information that was then available. In other words. perform an assessment based on the information available to the decision makers, or what can be called an assessment ex ante. The question that should then be answered is whether the analysis and the interest rate decision were reasonable given the information and the forecasts available at the time. Did the Riksbank, for example, arrive at a reasonable balance between stabilising inflation and stabilising resource utilisation?  An assessment based on the information available to the decision maker also has the great advantage that it can be conducted in real time immediately after the publication of the monetary policy decision and the information and analysis on which the decision is based. One does not thus need to wait for a couple years to see what the outcomes for inflation and the real economy will be. The decisions of the Riksbank can therefore be assessed and debated on an ongoing basis.  An important part of the assessment of a flexible inflation targeting policy is to assess how credible the inflation target is, measured in terms of the extent to which various economic agents’ inflation expectations correspond to the inflation target. If inflation expectations are stable close to the inflation target then the target is credible and it will therefore be easier for the Riksbank to stabilise both inflation and resource utilisation.  As I have already said, it takes time for monetary policy to have an impact on inflation and the real economy. Monetary policy is therefore governed by forecasts. It is a question of choosing a repo-rate path so that the forecast for inflation and resource utilisation entails the best possible stabilisation of inflation and resource utilisation. As the forecasts play such a central role in the monetary policy decisions, it is of course important that the Riksbank employs good forecasting methods and uses all the relevant information available when the forecasts are produced so that they are as accurate as possible. An important step in the assessment of monetary policy is therefore to investigate whether the forecasts are reasonably accurate. One way to do this is to compare the Riksbank’s forecasts with those of other forecasters. The Riksbank makes such comparisons every year.  Another component of the assessment of monetary policy is to analyse how predictable monetary policy is and what impact it has on market rates. Monetary policy mainly acts by influencing expectations regarding interest rates, inflation and the real economy in the future. Expectations regarding the repo rate in the years immediately ahead affect interest rates with 2 BIS Review 32/2010 
longer maturities, and therefore inflation and the real economy, more than the repo rate in the period up to the next monetary policy decision. The predictability of monetary policy can be measured in terms of how well the market predicts the next repo-rate path. How effectively monetary policy steers market expectations and market rates can be measured in terms of how closely the market expectations regarding future repo rates correspond to the repo-rate path after it is published.  The Riksbank’s material for the assessment of monetary policy in Sweden in 2009 is based on the principles I have just described and this entails a certain renewal compared to the assessments of previous years.1 I now intend to present the material for assessing monetary policy in 2009 that the Riksbank published a few days ago. As you probably know, from and including the meeting held in April 2009 I have entered reservations against the monetary policy decisions and advocated a lower repo-rate path, on the grounds that this would better stabilise both CPIF inflation and resource utilisation without leading to problems for financial stability or the functioning of the financial markets.2 However, in my speech today I will focus on the policy conducted by the majority of the Executive Board.  2009 – an extraordinary year for monetary policy  In 2009, the Riksbank continued to conduct an increasingly expansionary monetary policy. The aim was to attain the inflation target and to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis on the real economy. From February to the beginning of July, the Riksbank cut the repo rate from 2.0 per cent to the all-time low of 0.25 per cent. The repo-rate path, that is the Riksbank’s forecast of the development of the repo rate in the years ahead, was also revised downwards at every monetary policy meeting during this period. During the rest of the year, the repo rate and the repo-rate path were left unchanged. As a result of the turbulence on the financial markets, however, the impact of monetary policy was weaker than normal in 2009. The Riksbank responded to these problems by complementing monetary policy with extensive lending to the banks.  So, what was the nature of the forecasts and assessments that formed the basis for the monetary policy decisions?  The repo rate was cut to 1 percent and the repo-rate path was adjusted downwards in February  In February, it appeared that the downturn in economic activity, in Sweden and abroad, would be more severe and would happen much more quickly than previously assessed by the Riksbank. At the monetary policy meeting on 10 February, the Riksbank therefore decided to cut the repo rate by a whole percentage point to one percent. The repo-rate path was adjusted downwards and a further repo-rate cut during 2009 was indicated (see Figure 1).                                                   1  For a more detailed description of how one can assess monetary policy see Lars E.0. Svensson, “Assessing monetary policy”, speech at Uppsala University, 13 March 2009. 2  For a more detailed description of the arguments behind my reservations see Lars E. O. Svensson: “Why a lower repo-rate path?”, speech at Umeå University, 24 February 2010. BIS Review 32/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 32/2010  The Monetary Policy Report from February 2009 presented forecasts based on the Report’s main scenario and alternative forecasts based on the repo-rate path adopted at the meeting in December 2008.3 These are shown in Figure 2.a, where the higher repo rate path (the blue broken curve) represents the forecast from December 2008. The lower repo rate path (the red broken curve) represents the Riksbank’s main scenario from February 2009.  The Riksbank’s inflation targets are expressed in terms of CPI inflation. However, this varied strongly during the later part of 2008 and in 2009, due to the major changes in the repo rate. This is because the CPI includes mortgage costs. In such a situation, it is reasonable instead to look at inflation measured in terms of the CPIF, which excludes interest rate changes. Figure 2.b illustrates the Riksbank’s forecasts for CPIF inflation, based on the two repo-rate paths. The lower repo-rate path, as proposed in the main scenario, gave an inflation forecast, measured in terms of the CPIF, approaching 2 per cent two years ahead. The higher repo rate path instead gave an inflation forecast that fell widely short of the target during the entire forecast period. Equivalent forecasts for CPI inflation are shown in Figure 2.c.  The Riksbank uses a number of measures and indicators to measure resource utilisation in the economy. One of these measures is the output gap, calculated as the percentage difference between GDP and an estimated trend.4 If the gap is positive, this signifies that the level of activity in the economy is high and that GDP is above its trend level. The opposite                                                  3  Alternative forecasts for the repo rate are published in the Monetary Policy Reports, three times per year. Alternative forecasts for the repo rate are also discussed ahead of the remaining monetary policy meetings, but these are not published in the Monetary Policy Updates. 4  The trend is estimated using a so-called Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP filter). This is a statistical method for dividing the movements of a variable into trend and cyclical components. The method can be described as a weighted double-sided moving average where greater weight is placed on observations close at hand and gradually decreasing weight on more distant observations. The output gap according to the HP method should not necessarily be interpreted as the Riksbank’s overall assessment of resource utilisation. 
applies when the gap is negative. Figure 2.d illustrates the output gap based on the two repo rate paths. Both paths resulted in negative output gaps during the forecast period, that is to say resource utilisation below the normal level. However, using the repo rate path in the main scenario gave a less negative output gap, using this measurement method, than using the repo rate path from December 2008. The lower repo-rate path thus stabilised both CPIF inflation and resource utilisation better than the higher repo rate path.  Further repo-rate cuts in April and July  GDP continued to fall dramatically during the first quarter of the year, in Sweden as well as abroad, and the GDP forecast for 2009 was revised further downwards compared to the Riksbank’s assessment in February. The Riksbank also assessed that CPI inflation would fall very rapidly during 2009, which was largely due to the rapid interest rate cuts implemented at the end of 2008 and start of 2009. At the monetary policy meeting on 20 April, the repo rate was cut by 0.5 percentage points to 0.5 per cent. The repo rate was expected to remain at a low level until the beginning of 2011 (see Figure 1).  In July, the assessment was that the decline in economic activity during 2009 would be slightly deeper than the assessment made by the Riksbank in April. The Riksbank’s assessment was that the repo rate and the repo-rate path needed to be even lower. The repo rate was cut by 0.25 percentage points to 0.25 per cent at the monetary policy meeting on 1 July. The repo rate was expected to remain at this low level until the autumn of 2010 (see Figure 1). The Riksbank also assessed that the cut did not represent a threat to the functioning of the financial markets. Furthermore, the Riksbank deemed that, following the cut to 0.25 per cent, the repo rate had in practice reached its lower bound.  BIS Review 32/2010 5 
The alternative repo-rate paths published in the Monetary Policy Report in July and the associated forecasts for CPIF inflation and the output gap are shown in Figure 3. The majority of the Executive Board adopted the repo-rate path marked as the main scenario.   The situation on the financial markets in Sweden and abroad started to show signs of improvement during the spring, but was still highly uncertain. Major divergences between the market’s repo rate expectations and the Riksbank’s repo-rate path also arose during the year (see Figure 4). This resulted in monetary policy having less impact than intended. Partly for this reason, the Riksbank decided to lend up to SEK 100 million to the banks in the form of fixed-rate loans at a maturity of 12 months. It was deemed that this measure could contribute to lower interest rates on loans to companies and households. 6 BIS Review 32/2010 
 The repo rate and the repo-rate path were left unchanged during the rest of the year Following the decision in July, there were an increasing number of signs of a turnaround in economic activity in Sweden and abroad. At the monetary policy meetings on 2 September and 22 October, it was decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 0.25 per cent. The forecast for the repo rate was also held unchanged on both occasions (see Figure 1). Figure 5 illustrates the alternative forecasts for the repo rate, inflation and resource utilisation discussed at the monetary policy meeting in October. BIS Review 32/2010 7 
8 BIS Review 32/2010  As a complementary monetary policy measure, the Riksbank decided, on both occasions, to make further fixed-rate loans of up to SEK 100 billion available to the banks for twelve months.  The recovery from the deep recession continued during the autumn. At the Monetary Policy Meeting on 15 December, the Riksbank resolved to leave the repo rate unchanged, at 0.25 per cent. The forecast for the repo rate was also held unchanged. How can different monetary policy alternatives be assessed? In connection with every monetary policy decision, the Executive Board makes an assessment of the repo-rate path needed for monetary policy to be considered to be well-balanced. One natural way of assessing which repo-rate path is best in a given situation is to compare the forecasts for inflation and resource utilisation for alternative repo-rate paths. Such a comparison can be found in Chapter 2 of the Monetary Policy Report and in the material for the assessment of monetary policy in 2009 that was recently published by the Riksbank.5 The alternative scenarios are usually presented in the form of figures that show the forecast for inflation and various measures of resource utilisation that a particular repo-rate path is expected to give rise to.                                                  5  See "Material for assessing monetary policy in 2009", Sveriges Riksbank. 
A box in the material for assessing monetary policy in 2009 describes a method for summarising the information in the alternative forecasts. This method uses an easily-grasped measure, a so-called mean squared gap, of how effectively an interest rate path can stabilise inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around a normal level.6  Allow me to illustrate the method by using an example from the Monetary Policy Report published in October 2009, in which a box presented the method. Figure 6 shows the forecast development of inflation measured in terms of the CPIF and resource utilisation measured in terms of the output gap for the various repo-rate paths discussed in the Monetary Policy Report of October 2009. The various repo-rate paths are shown in Figure 6.a. The path in the middle is that of the main scenario, the repo rate path that the majority of the Executive Board chose at the meeting in October. The lower path is the one I advocated. Figure 6.b shows the forecasts for CPIF inflation that each repo-rate path was expected to give rise to.7 The output gap, which is shown in Figure 6.d, is calculated in the same way as in the figures I presented earlier. Figure 6.c shows the mean squared gap. A lower mean squared gap for inflation entails a better acquisition of the inflation target; that is a better stabilisation of inflation around the inflation target. A lower mean squared gap for resource utilisation entails a better stabilisation of resource utilisation around a normal level. Consequently, the closer a point lies to origo, or “south-west” in the figure, the smaller are the total deviations of inflation from the inflation target and of resource utilisation from a normal level. From Figure 6.c, it can be seen that the lower repo-rate path from the alternative scenario in the Monetary Policy Report of October 2009 was closer to origo in both dimensions when inflation is measured in terms of the CPIF. It thus stabilises both inflation and resource utilisation better.                                                  6  The mean squared gap for inflation measures the gap between the inflation forecast and the inflation target or, more precisely, the mean squared deviation between the inflation forecast and the inflation target during the forecast period. The mean squared gap for resource utilisation, measured as the output gap, measures the deviation between the forecast for resource utilisation and normal resource utilisation – more precisely, as the average squared gap during the forecast period. For more discussion of this see Lars E.O. Svensson, “Evaluating Monetary Policy,” forthcoming in Koenig, Evan, and Robert Leeson, eds., From the Great Moderation to the Great Deviation: A Round-Trip Journey Based on the Work of John B. Taylor (revision and update of a speech at Uppsala University on 13 March 2009). 7  One may ask why the focus should be on the CPIF and not the CPI. In a situation in which extensive repo-rate changes have very large direct effects on the CPI, I consider it to be more appropriate to focus on stabilising the CPIF around the inflation target, instead of the CPI. BIS Review 32/2010 9 
  However, the assessment of the majority of the Executive Board was that the lower repo-rate path was not appropriate. At the monetary policy meetings held during the course of the year, the view of several members of the Executive Board was that the effects of the very low repo-rate levels on the economy and the financial markets were uncertain and that there was therefore reason to be cautious about reducing the repo rate below 0.25 per cent.  It is not easy to make reliable estimates and forecasts of potential production and resource utilisation. The Riksbank’s estimates and forecasts for potential production and hours worked are in need of improvement and development. Such development work is currently underway. In 2009, the financial crisis reduced potential production so that resource utilisation in the economy is not as low for a given level of production as before. There is no doubt, however, that resource utilisation is very low and will remain lower than normal during the forecast period (see Figure 7). 10 BIS Review 32/2010 
 The numerical inflation target has entailed great progress for practical monetary policy and made it possible to measure and evaluate the target fulfilment of monetary policy in a much more efficient manner than before. However, the fact that monetary policy is not just directed towards stabilising inflation, but also towards stabilising resource utilisation has, in the absence of quantitative measures of stability in these variables, made it difficult to measure and evaluate target fulfilment in this stability dimension. Quantitative measures such as the mean squared gaps make it possible to measure and evaluate this target fulfilment, however. Work is now underway at the Riksbank to determine how such measures can be used. The results of this work will be successively reported in the Monetary Policy Report and in other documents published by the Riksbank. How did the outcome for 2009 compare to our forecasts? Inflation far below the target and a record fall in GDP The rate of inflation, measured as the change in the CPI, averaged –0.3 per cent in 2009; it was thus far below the inflation target of 2 per cent. This is explained – as I have already mentioned – by the Riksbank’s substantial repo-rate cuts, which began in the autumn of 2008. The Riksbank’s repo-rate cuts led to lower mortgage rates and mortgage rates are included in the CPI. Measured in terms of the CPIF, which is the CPI with a fixed mortgage rate, inflation was more stable and averaged 1.9 per cent in 2009.  The repo-rate cuts in 2008 and 2009 were made in the full realisation that CPI inflation would be low. In the longer term, however, the repo-rate cuts will help to keep CPI inflation up in line with the target. The fact that CPI inflation was far below the target can thus be seen as the result of a deliberate monetary policy from the autumn of 2008. GDP fell by 4.9 per cent in 2009. This is the largest fall in Swedish GDP in a single year in modern times. Average unemployment increased by approximately 2.2 percentage points during the year and amounted to 8.4 per cent in 2009. Both employment and the number of BIS Review 32/2010 11 
12 BIS Review 32/2010 hours worked fell significantly. The reason that Sweden was so hard hit by the global crisis is that the Swedish economy is highly dependent on exports. The effect on GDP was reinforced by the fact that the households increased their saving. Companies also sold from stock to a great extent during the year, thus reducing investments in stock and contributing to the fall in GDP. The impact of the financial crisis surprised all the forecasters The turmoil on the financial markets has been part of the picture and has influenced monetary policy and the forecasts since 2007. It nevertheless came as a surprise that the situation would deteriorate as dramatically as it did in the autumn of 2008 and result in such a dramatic fall in production around the world. Neither the Riksbank nor other analysts predicted the strength of the global financial crisis and how much it would affect inflation and the development of the real economy. Figure 8 shows the forecasts for average CPI inflation in 2009 made by various forecasters during 2008 and 2009.8 The figure shows that the pattern over time is roughly the same for all the forecasters. During the first half of 2008, most forecasters expected that inflation would be between 2 and just below 3 per cent in 2009, while the actual outcome was  –0.3 per cent. The explanation for this overestimation is that the forecasters did not foresee that the financial crisis would take such a dramatic turn in the autumn and, consequently, that inflation would fall so quickly as a result of the Riksbank’s repo-rate cuts. Once the financial crisis was upon us and the dramatic downturn in economic activity that followed in its wake had begun, all of the forecasters revised their forecasts downwards quickly and substantially. From the beginning of 2009, the forecasts were gathered around the actual outcome.                                                  8  The analysis is based on data gathered by the National Institute of Economic Research. One advantage of these data is that they show exactly when the forecasts were made. The forecast comparison covers ten forecasting institutions and their whole-year forecasts for GDP growth, the CPI and the percentage of unemployed. The ten forecasting institutions are: the Swedish Ministry of Finance, the Swedish Retail Institute, the National Institute of Economic Research, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), Nordea, SEB, Svenska Handelsbanken, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, Swedbank and the Riksbank. The figure is interpreted as follows: Each mark represents a particular inflation forecast. The red marks show the Riksbank’s forecasts, while the blue marks show the forecasts made by a number of other forecasters. It is possible to see how high an inflation rate a forecaster has predicted by looking at the vertical axel, while the horizontal axel shows when the forecast was made. The dotted line in the figure shows the actual outcome for CPI inflation in 2009. 
    Figure 9 shows the forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 made by various forecasters in 2008 and 2009. In this case, too, it is clear that the forecasts follow a common pattern. Initially, the forecasters tended to overestimate GDP growth in 2009 During the first half of 2008, they estimated on average that growth in 2009 would be approximately 2 per cent. As it appeared BIS Review 32/2010 13 
14 BIS Review 32/2010 that the financial turmoil would dampen growth in both Sweden and abroad, the GDP forecasts were gradually revised downwards. After April 2009, many of the forecasts were gathered around the actual outcome for GDP growth, which was –4.9 per cent. However, most of the forecasters revised their forecasts upwards towards the end of the year and were thus surprised by the lower outcome. All in all, it can be noted that the Riksbank overestimated the outcome for inflation in 2009 to approximately the same extent as the average for other forecasters, although with the exception of July and September 2008 when the Riksbank’s forecasts overestimated the prospects for inflation to a higher degree than other forecasters (see Figure 8). This was because energy prices increased more than expected during the spring, which led to inflation reaching over 4 per cent in the summer of 2008. The Riksbank thus saw a risk that the substantial increases in the prices of food and oil would also lead to rapid increases in other prices. Unusually high inflation expectations also contributed to this assessment.  With regard to the outcome for GDP growth, the Riksbank’s overestimation was approximately the same as the average of the other forecasters. All of the forecasters continued to overestimate GDP growth for 2009 even during the first quarter of 2009. In other words, no forecaster predicted the economic downturn sooner than any other. How accurate are the Riksbank’s forecasts? As monetary policy is based on forecasts it is important that the Riksbank’s forecasts are acceptably accurate. However, it is not possible to assess accuracy by analysing the forecasts for a single year. Even forecasters with a good average accuracy may be less successful in an individual year. A fairer assessment requires a longer observation period. A fair comparison of the accuracy of different forecasts should take into account the fact that the forecasts are made at different points in time and that different forecasters therefore do not have the same information available to them. In the comparison of forecasts made in the material for the assessment of monetary policy, a method is used that takes such differences into account.9 Figure 10 shows an adjusted absolute average error for the inflation forecasts for the period 1999–2009, that is the absolute forecasting error for CPI inflation adjusting for differences in the forecast horizon.10 The shorter the bar, the smaller the forecasting error and the higher the accuracy of the forecast.                                                   9  See M. Andersson and T. Aranki, “A comparison of different forecasters’ ability given the publication date effect”, Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review, No.1, 2009. 10  The average error is calculated as the mean value of the forecaster's forecasting errors during the forecast period. The absolute average error means that the sign of the individual forecast deviations is not taken into account. 
  The major forecasters – the Swedish Ministry of Finance, the National Institute of Economic Research and the Riksbank – are reported individually, while the others are reported as an average. It may be worth noting that the Riksbank’s forecasts up to the third Inflation Report of 2005 were based on the assumption of an unchanged repo rate during the forecasting period. This may have hampered the accuracy.  The differences between different forecasters are small and it is hard to find significant variations. The forecasts of different forecasters tend to follow each other relatively closely, as indicated in Figure 8. In the material for the assessment of monetary policy there are similar figures for the forecasts for GDP growth and unemployment (see Figure 11 and Figure 12). Taken together, these figures show that the Riksbank, just like other forecasters, tended to overestimate CPI inflation and GDP growth and to underestimate unemployment during the period 1999–2009. BIS Review 32/2010 15 
 With regard to forecasts of the repo rate it is still too soon to compare the forecasting performance of various forecasters as the Riksbank has only published repo rate forecasts for three years. With such a short assessment period, chance plays too large a role to make it meaningful to draw any general conclusions about forecasting performance. Figure 13 nevertheless shows the accuracy of the forecasts for the repo rate in the period 2007–2009 for those forecasters that publish such forecasts. 16 BIS Review 32/2010 
 On average for the three years, all of the forecasters have tended to overestimate the repo rate, but the Riksbank has the largest forecasting error of the five forecasters. The main reason for the Riksbank’s relatively larger forecasting error during this period is the previously mentioned overestimation in the forecasts for CPI inflation in July and September 2008. On these occasions, the Riksbank’s forecasts overestimated the prospects for inflation to a greater degree than those of other forecasters. As I said earlier, the overestimations were due to concern on the part of the Riksbank that significant increases in the prices of oil and food during the spring, in combination with unusually high inflation expectations, would lead to an increase in inflation. The credibility of the inflation target Confidence in the inflation target in the form of stable inflation expectations close to the target is fundamental to the Riksbank’s efforts to achieve price stability and stable resource utilisation. This is because inflation expectations affect wage formation and pricing. Stable inflation expectations thus contribute to stable inflation.  A high level of credibility for the inflation target also increases the possibility of the Riksbank to stabilise resource utilisation. If an increase in inflation was rapidly reflected in higher inflation expectations, the Riksbank would be forced to act more quickly and more forcefully than would otherwise have been necessary to dampen demand and prevent the inflationary impulse gaining a lasting foothold. The fluctuations in the real economy would thereby be greater than if inflation expectations were better anchored. Establishing credibility for the belief that inflation will be keep low and stable is therefore important in the effort to increase macroeconomic stability. If inflation expectations as indicated in various surveys are stable and close to the inflation target a few years ahead, this can be interpreted to mean that the public is confident that the Riksbank will achieve its target. The surveys that TNS Sifo Prospera has carried out of inflation expectations among money market agents, employer and employee organisations and purchasing managers in the retail sector and the manufacturing industry show that this is the case. Figure 14 shows average expectations regarding CPI inflation for one, two and five BIS Review 32/2010 17 
18 BIS Review 32/2010 years ahead among all of the participants in the Prospera survey. Inflation expectations five years ahead are close to 2 per cent, which shows that the credibility of the inflation target is high.    Inflation expectations for shorter horizons are based to a greater degree on current actual inflation.11 The exceptional circumstances for monetary policy that have followed in the wake of the financial crisis, with substantial and rapid cuts in the repo rate, have pushed down CPI inflation to unusually low levels. This, together with the severe downturn and the uncertainty that prevails concerning the recovery of the economy, means that it is hardly surprising that short-term inflation expectations are now below the target. How well did the market’s expectations regarding the repo rate match the Riksbank’s repo-rate path?  Since February 2007, the Riksbank has published its own forecast of the development of the repo rate in the period ahead. A published repo-rate path makes it easier to explain the Riksbank’s view of developments and its reasoning to the public and the financial markets when the monetary policy decisions are made. The aim is to improve the Riksbank’s ability to steer expectations regarding the monetary policy that will be conducted in the future. Expectations regarding the repo rate influence the more long-term interest rates which in turn are important to the economic decisions of the households and companies. The Riksbank updates its repo rate paths at the monetary policy meetings, which are held approximately every other month. During this two-month period, new information on the development of the economy may emerge. If the Riksbank is successful in communicating the principles for monetary policy, the market participants should be able to predict rather                                                  11  See T. Jonsson and P. Österholm, “The Properties of Survey-Based Inflation Expectations in Sweden”, Working paper no. 114, 2009, National Institute of Economic Research.   
well how new information will affect the Riksbank’s repo rate path. This should then help to ensure that there will be only small deviations between the market’s expectations on the day before the publication of a repo-rate path and the repo-rate path that the Riksbank actually publishes.  The Riksbank’s repo-rate paths in 2007 and 2008 were, by and large, well predicted by the market. In four cases out of six, expectations were already in line with the Riksbank’s repo-rate path before publication, which can be interpreted as indicating that the market’s ability to predict and understand monetary policy was strong. When there were significant deviations, the market in most cases adjusted its expectations towards the repo-rate path after publication, which also indicates that in general it has not been so difficult to understand the Riksbank’s reasoning.  Despite the fact that the economic situation was highly uncertain in February 2009 and that the repo-rate path was significantly lowered, the new repo-rate path was predicted relatively well by the market and the market’s expectations also shifted closer to the new repo-rate path after publication (see Figure 15). From April 2009, however, relatively large differences between the market’s expectations and the Riksbank’s repo-rate path appeared. In advance of the monetary policy meeting in April, the market expected that the forecast for the repo rate over the next year would be lowered again. However, the Riksbank’s new forecast entailed a considerably lower repo rate in 2010 and 2011 than the market had expected. Even so, the Riksbank’s new forecast did not significantly affect market expectations (see Figure 16).   BIS Review 32/2010 19 
20 BIS Review 32/2010   In the period leading up to December, market expectations of the development of the repo rate changed relatively little, even though the Riksbank cut its repo rate forecast further in July and then held to this forecast during the entire autumn. However, from December, market expectations have approached the Riksbank’s forecasts (see Figure 4).  So how can the gap between market expectations and the Riksbank’s repo rate forecasts in 2009 be explained? Some of the deviations may be explained, for example, by the possibility that statements on the lower bound of the repo rate were interpreted to mean that there were only upside risks for the repo rate, but this does not explain them all. A major part of the deviations thus remain to be explained. One possible explanation may be that money market participants have taken a more positive view of economic development. For example, they may have expected GDP growth and inflation to be higher in the future than stated in the Riksbank’s forecasts, and thus require a tighter monetary policy. However, this hypothesis is not supported by surveys of the expected economic development. These show that the money market participants expected both lower inflation and lower GDP growth in the period ahead than the Riksbank.12 The market participants seem to have believed in a different reaction pattern from the Riksbank than that expressed in the repo-rate path. The disagreement among the members of the Executive Board may have contributed to this. At the monetary policy meetings in July, September, October and December, reservations against the published repo rate path were entered by members who considered that the repo rate path in 2010 should be slightly higher.                                                  12  See TNS SIFO Prospera’s surveys of expectations of inflation and GDP growth among money market participants in 2009. See also Lars E.O. Svensson (2010), “Policy expectations and policy evaluations: the role of transparency and communication” Sveriges Riksbank Economic Review, No. 1, 2010. 
BIS Review 32/2010 21 Monetary policy has mitigated the effects of the crisis The Riksbank has reacted forcefully and successfully to the major shocks that have occurred since the autumn of 2008 – even if I personally, as revealed by my reservations during the course of 2009, would have liked to have seen the Riksbank react even more forcefully and thus stabilise inflation and resource utilisation even better. The global recession that followed in the wake of the financial crisis surprised us all and was met by a marked shift in monetary policy that entailed rapid and repeated cuts in the repo rate up to the summer of 2009. The repo-rate cuts led to lower mortgage rates, which in turn pushed down CPI inflation. However, the cuts helped to keep CPIF inflation close to the target. The series of repo-rate cuts that began in the autumn of 2008 was necessary in order to mitigate the effects of the financial crisis on the real economy and to achieve a better attainment of the inflation target. Without these substantial reductions in the repo rate, GDP would have fallen even more. Monetary policy was also complemented by extensive lending to the banks. These complementary measures have helped the financial markets to function more effectively, eased the supply of credit and increased the impact of monetary policy. 
Ben S Bernanke: The Federal Reserve’s role in bank supervision Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 17 March 2010. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the Committee, I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve’s role in bank supervision and the actions that we are taking to strengthen our supervisory oversight.  The Federal Reserve’s role in supervision Like many central banks around the world, the Federal Reserve cooperates with other agencies in regulating and supervising the banking system.1 Our specific responsibilities include the oversight of about 5,000 bank holding companies, including the umbrella supervision of large, complex financial firms; the supervision of about 850 banks nationwide that are both state-chartered and members of the Federal Reserve System (state member banks); and the oversight of foreign banking organizations operating in the United States.  The Federal Reserve’s involvement in regulation and supervision confers two broad sets of benefits to the country. First, because of its wide range of expertise, the Federal Reserve is uniquely suited to supervise large, complex financial organizations and to address both safety and soundness risks and risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole. Second, the Federal Reserve’s participation in the oversight of banks of all sizes significantly improves its ability to carry out its central banking functions, including making monetary policy, lending through the discount window, and fostering financial stability.2  The financial crisis has made clear that all financial institutions that are so large and interconnected that their failure could threaten the stability of the financial system and the economy must be subject to strong consolidated supervision. Promoting the safety and soundness of individual banking organizations requires the traditional skills of bank supervisors, such as expertise in examinations of risk-management practices; the Federal Reserve has developed such expertise in its long experience supervising banks of all sizes, including community banks and regional banks. But the supervision of large, complex financial institutions and the analysis of potential risks to the financial system as a whole require not only traditional examination skills, but also a number of other forms of expertise, including macroeconomic analysis and forecasting; insight into sectoral, regional, and global                                                  1  In the aftermath of the crisis, the view that the involvement of central banks in bank supervision strongly complements their roles as lender of last resort, guardian of financial stability, and monetary policymaker has received increasing international support. For example, following the problems at Northern Rock in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England was given statutory responsibilities in the area of financial stability, its powers to collect information from banks were augmented, and many have called for it to be given increased supervisory authority. In Germany, plans to shift bank supervisory powers from the financial services regulator to the Bundesbank have received significant attention. In the European Union, a new European Systemic Risk Board is being established under which national central banks and the European Central Bank will play a key role in efforts to protect the financial system from systemic risk. More broadly, in most industrial countries today the central bank has substantial bank supervisory authorities, is responsible for broad financial stability, or both. 2  See Ben S. Bernanke (2010), letter to Christopher J. Dodd and Richard C. Shelby (with enclosure, “The Public Policy Case for a Role for the Federal Reserve in Bank Supervision and Regulation”), January 13. BIS Review 31/2010 1 
economic developments; knowledge of a range of domestic and international financial markets, including money markets, capital markets, and foreign exchange and derivatives markets; and a close working knowledge of the financial infrastructure, including payment systems and systems for clearing and settlement of financial instruments.  In the course of carrying out its central banking duties, the Federal Reserve has developed extensive knowledge and experience in each of these areas critical for effective consolidated supervision. For example, Federal Reserve staff members have expertise in macroeconomic forecasting for the making of monetary policy, which is important for helping to identify economic risks to institutions and markets. In addition, they acquire in-depth market knowledge through daily participation in financial markets to implement monetary policy and to execute financial transactions on behalf of the U.S. Treasury. Similarly, the Federal Reserve’s extensive knowledge of payment and settlement systems has been developed through its operation of some of the world’s largest such systems, its supervision of key providers of payment and settlement services, and its long-standing leadership in the international Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems. No other agency can, or is likely to be able to, replicate the breadth and depth of relevant expertise that the Federal Reserve brings to the supervision of large, complex banking organizations and the identification and analysis of systemic risks.  Even as the Federal Reserve’s central banking functions enhance its supervisory expertise, its involvement in supervising banks of all sizes across the country significantly improves the Federal Reserve’s ability to effectively carry out its central-bank responsibilities. Perhaps most important, as this crisis has once again demonstrated, the Federal Reserve’s ability to identify and address diverse and hard-to-predict threats to financial stability depends critically on the information, expertise, and powers that it has as both a bank supervisor and a central bank. Not only in this crisis, but also in episodes such as the 1987 stock market crash and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory role was essential for it to contain threats to financial stability.3  The Federal Reserve’s making of monetary policy and its management of the discount window also benefit from its supervisory experience.4 Notably, the Federal Reserve’s role as a supervisor of state member banks of all sizes, including community banks, offers insights about conditions and prospects across the full range of financial institutions, not just the very largest, and provides useful information about the economy and financial conditions throughout the nation. Such information greatly assists in the making of monetary policy. The legislation passed by the House last December would preserve the supervisory authority that the Federal Reserve needs to carry out its central banking functions effectively.  Improving the Federal Reserve’s supervision of banking organizations The Federal Reserve strongly supports ongoing efforts in the Congress to reform financial regulation and close existing gaps in the regulatory framework.5 While we await passage of                                                  3  For further discussion, see the Bernanke letter to Dodd and Shelby in note 2. 4  Our ability to monitor key payment and settlement systems also depends critically on our supervisory powers, as several key institutions involved in payments and settlements have state member bank or Edge charters. Without bank supervisory authority, the Federal Reserve would have no ability to examine or regulate such institutions. 5  Lack of strong consolidated supervision of systemically critical firms not organized as bank holding companies proved to be the most serious regulatory gap. In addition, under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the Federal Reserve’s consolidated supervision of bank holding companies was both narrowly focused on the safety and soundness of their bank subsidiaries and heavily reliant on functional supervisors of the bank and regulated nonbank subsidiaries of these companies; in turn, the functional supervisors themselves were statutorily focused only on the safety and soundness of the specific entities they regulated. None of the federal regulators had sufficient authority to focus on the systemic risk that large banking organizations posed. 2 BIS Review 31/2010 
comprehensive reform legislation, we have been conducting an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory performance and have been actively implementing improvements.  On the regulatory side, we have played a key role in international efforts to ensure that systemically critical financial institutions hold more and higher-quality capital, have enough liquidity to survive highly stressed conditions, and meet demanding standards for company-wide risk management. We have also been taking the lead in addressing flawed compensation practices by issuing proposed guidance to help ensure that compensation structures at banking organizations provide appropriate incentives without encouraging excessive risk-taking.6 Less formally, but equally important, since 2005 the Federal Reserve has been leading cooperative efforts by market participants and regulators to strengthen the infrastructure of a number of key markets, including the market for securities repurchase agreements and the markets for credit derivatives and other over-the-counter derivative instruments.  To improve both our consolidated supervision and our ability to identify potential risks to the financial system, we have made substantial changes to our supervisory framework. So that we can better understand linkages among firms and markets that have the potential to undermine the stability of the financial system, we have adopted a more explicitly multidisciplinary approach, making use of the Federal Reserve’s broad expertise in economics, financial markets, payment systems, and bank supervision to which I alluded earlier. We are also augmenting our traditional supervisory approach that focuses on firm-by-firm examinations with greater use of horizontal reviews that look across a group of firms to identify common sources of risks and best practices for managing those risks. To supplement information from examiners in the field, we are developing an off-site, enhanced quantitative surveillance program for large bank holding companies that will use data analysis and formal modeling to help identify vulnerabilities at both the firm level and for the financial sector as a whole. This analysis will be supported by the collection of more timely, detailed, and consistent data from regulated firms.  Many of these changes draw on the successful experience of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP), also known as the banking stress test, which the Federal Reserve led last year. As in the SCAP, representatives of primary and functional supervisors will be fully integrated in the process, participating in the planning and execution of horizontal exams and consolidated supervisory activities.  Improvements in the supervisory framework will lead to better outcomes only if day-to-day supervision is well executed, with risks identified early and promptly remediated. Our internal reviews have identified a number of directions for improvement. In the future, to facilitate swifter, more-effective supervisory responses, the oversight and control of our supervisory function will be more centralized, with shared accountability by senior Board and Reserve Bank supervisory staff and active oversight by the Board of Governors. Supervisory concerns will be communicated to firms promptly and at a high level, with more-frequent involvement of senior bank managers and boards of directors and senior Federal Reserve officials. Greater involvement of senior Federal Reserve officials and strong, systematic follow-through will facilitate more vigorous remediation by firms. Where necessary, we will increase the use of formal and informal enforcement actions to ensure prompt and effective remediation of serious issues.  In summary, the Federal Reserve’s wide range of expertise makes it uniquely suited to supervise large, complex financial institutions and to help identify risks to the financial system                                                  6  For additional information, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Issues Proposed Guidance on Incentive Compensation,” press release, October 22. We are currently conducting a horizontal review of compensation practices at the largest firms. BIS Review 31/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 31/2010 as a whole. Moreover, the insights provided by our role in supervising a range of banks, including community banks, significantly increases our effectiveness in making monetary policy and fostering financial stability. While we await enactment of comprehensive financial reform legislation, we have undertaken an intensive self-examination of our regulatory and supervisory performance. We are strengthening regulation and overhauling our supervisory framework to improve consolidated supervision as well as our ability to identify potential threats to the stability of the financial system. And we are taking steps to strengthen the oversight and effectiveness of our supervisory activities.  Thank you. I’d be pleased to respond to your questions.  
BIS Review 38/2010 1 Svein Gjedrem: Prospects for the Norwegian economy Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at Sparebank 1 SR-Bank Stavanger, Stavanger, 26 March 2010. The text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The speech is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 24 March and Monetary Policy Report 1/10. *      *      * The most acute phase of the global economic crisis appears to have passed. Output growth has resumed in most parts of the world and the recovery has been strongest in emerging market economies in Asia.  The crisis has given rise to new imbalances that will dampen the recovery. Fiscal deficits are substantial in many countries and government debt is rising rapidly. Deficits have increased markedly because of reduced tax revenues and stimulus measures to underpin activity, but also due to government support measures for banks. The interest rates at which governments borrow reflect to a large extent their financial position. Reducing government debt in the US and many European countries will probably take several years. Fiscal tightening is expected to commence among our main trading partners as from next year, with the exception of Sweden. This will curb growth in overall demand for goods and services. Even with substantial tax cuts, strong growth in public spending and low interest rates, unemployment has risen considerably in both the US and Europe. In many countries, unemployment has grown by 3–4 percentage points. There is a risk that unemployment will become entrenched, perhaps particularly in Europe.  It appears that the upturn in advanced economies will only be moderate. The economies of many countries will continue to be marked by considerable spare output capacity. Spare capacity and high unemployment will contribute to low inflation among trading partners in the coming years.  Oil prices are just below USD 80 per barrel. Our projections are based on an oil price in line futures prices. Futures prices indicate that oil prices will rise ahead. Emerging market economies are making a growing contribution to global oil demand. These economies are expected to continue to record solid growth. In addition, OPEC is steadily gaining market power because growth in oil supply from non-OPEC countries is gradually stagnating. Oil prices may nevertheless edge down if the recovery in the world economy loses momentum, particularly since OECD oil stocks are still at elevated levels and OPEC spare production capacity is relatively high. Gas prices are under pressure owing to increased availability of shale gas in the US, a higher supply of LNG and low demand in Europe. Futures prices indicate some rise in other commodity prices. Metal prices have risen as a result of improved global growth prospects, but they are still somewhat lower than in summer 2008.  Key rates are close to zero in many countries. A number of central banks have signalled that key rates will be kept low for an extended period, and key rate expectations abroad fell through autumn and winter. Market participants do not anticipate a rise in key rates in the US, the euro area and the UK until the end of 2010. The interest rate differential between Norway and trading partners has increased. The krone exchange rate has remained fairly stable through winter, although it is somewhat stronger than projected in October. The krone is expected to remain at about the current level to the end of the third quarter and then gradually depreciate somewhat thereafter. 
2 BIS Review 38/2010 Growth in the Norwegian economy came to a halt in autumn 2008, and Norway entered a downturn in early 2009. The decline appears to have ended in the second quarter of 2009. Capacity utilisation is lower than normal, but the downturn seems to be relatively mild. Activity has been underpinned by substantial interest rate cuts combined with higher public spending and high oil investment.  Fiscal policy was very expansionary in 2009. Petroleum revenue spending increased sharply, and by close to 3 per cent of mainland GDP. Revenue spending will rise further this year. Our projections are based on information from the final budget and the projections in the National Budget for 2010. In line with this, the level of the structural, non-oil budget deficit is maintained at this level to the end of the projection period.  According to the fiscal rule, the fiscal deficit should be reduced to about 4 per cent of the capital in the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) when the economy resumes a normal level of activity. If economic developments are broadly in line with projections, a fiscal stance in line with the fiscal rule could result in a lower interest rate and a weaker krone than projected. The Government has estimated that the annual return on the fund will be around 4 per cent over time. The average real return since the management of the fund began is now 2.7 per cent, up from just 1 per cent a year ago. The figure reflects the recent recovery from the sharpest deterioration in capital markets since World War II. With an unchanged risk profile, the average return will most probably move back towards 4 per cent after a period. The investment strategy of the fund is built on its long-term investment horizon and substantial size. In 2009, we benefited from the long-term investment horizon. The return on the fund was 25.6 per cent in 2009, which is the highest return ever recorded. The fund’s long-term investment horizon enabled it to buy equities and maintain its positions in corporate bonds when other investors were forced to sell assets at low prices during the financial crisis.  In June 2007, the Ministry of Finance decided to increase the allocation to equities from 40 to 60 per cent. This was achieved over the two following years when equities for more than NOK 1 trillion were purchased. The long period of phasing in purchases was profitable as the fund was able to exploit falling equity prices during the financial crisis. The fund’s global equity holdings doubled in the same period.  Petroleum investment has increased substantially in recent years. Investment increased between 2008 and 2009 in spite of postponements and cancellations of a number of projects after the financial crisis unfolded in autumn 2008. This reflects that investment projects in 2009 were to a large extent determined by contracts that were concluded prior to the financial crisis. Petroleum investment still showed a substantial decline through 2009. The volume of petroleum investment is expected to drop further this year and next, followed by a pick-up in 2012 and 2013. The investment decline this year and next reflects postponements of projects and the near completion of large investment projects.  Exports have picked up after world trade showed a faster and somewhat stronger increase than expected. Export companies in our regional network report that new orders have increased and that production is expected to rise over the next six months. A further increase in world trade will contribute to underpinning growth in exports.  Measured by relative labour costs, Norwegian labour has never been as costly as it is now. As a result, the Norwegian export industry may lose market shares ahead. There are no prospects of another rise in export prices as sharp as in the 2000s, when Norway’s terms of trade improved considerably. Norges Bank raised the key policy rate on two occasions by a total of 0.50 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2009. The feed-through to bank lending rates has so far been somewhat smaller. The average private lending rate increased by 0.09 percentage point from 
BIS Review 38/2010 3 the third to the fourth quarter, but the December interest rate increase will probably only feed through in 2010. Weighted mortgage lending rates have increased by a quarter percentage point since the key rate was raised for the first time in October. The fall in business investment seems to be nearing an end. Information from the regional network indicates that investment in private services will pick up this year. Manufacturing enterprises in the regional network report that investment will fall between 2009 and 2010. Corporate credit growth is still on the decline, but Norges Bank’s fourth-quarter survey of bank lending showed that banks have eased credit standards for the corporate sector. Commercial building starts have picked up slightly since summer.  Housing investment fell sharply between 2007 and 2009. Turnover of new homes has increased and house prices have risen markedly. Housing starts are expected to increase ahead. Household credit growth has been stable in recent months. Growth in private consumption increased through 2009 and growth is expected to continue. In spite of a lower interest rate level, the household saving ratio increased to a record-high level in 2009. This probably reflected high household debt levels with a need for some households to consolidate, and a large degree of uncertainty owing to prospects of higher unemployment and a fall in the value of housing wealth. At the same time, household real disposable income increased. Almost half the increase is attributable to a lower interest rate level.  Debt burdens are still high, but the stabilisation of employment at a relatively low level has contributed to reducing uncertainty. The interest rate level remains low. In addition, house prices have increased. The saving ratio is therefore expected to fall, and growth in private consumption is projected at 5 per cent in 2010.  Reports from Norges Bank’s regional network in February suggested that output growth will remain relatively weak in the coming quarters, but with wide variations across industries. Suppliers to the offshore sector expect activity to continue to shrink. The building and construction industry also expects a further fall in output, while reports from household suppliers and exporters suggest and increase in output ahead. There are still few regional network enterprises reporting that capacity constraints will make it difficult to accommodate higher demand. Since autumn 2009, it seems that capacity utilisation has increase somewhat in coastal regions from the southwest to the north. Many of the industries that are faring well are located in these regions, such as fish farming, fisheries, parts of the metal industry and suppliers of operating services to the oil sector.  Employment stopped falling in the fourth quarter of 2009. Total mainland employment had then declined by about 30 000 since autumn 2008. The fall in employment has been smaller than the decline in output might imply. Productivity has fallen markedly. During the downturn, the number of hours worked has decreased somewhat more than the number employed. According to the Bank’s regional network, reduced use of overtime hours, partial lay-offs and reduced working hours among part-timers have resulted in lower average working hours. Moreover, increased sickness absence has made a contribution. Output growth is expected to increase gradually through 2010, while growth in the number of hours worked shows a relatively small increase. As a result, employment will gradually become more consistent with the level of output, and productivity will rise further through 2010. Compared with previous downturns, productivity growth remains weak.  Owing to a fall in labour force participation, labour force figures were lower at the end of 2009 than at the beginning of the year in spite of underlying growth in the working-age population. Some people exit the labour force or choose not to enter the labour force when labour demand falls. Unemployment continued to rise in the latter half of 2009, but at a far slower pace than earlier in the downturn. Registered unemployment is projected to remain at about today’s level to the end of the year. The Technical Reporting Committee on Income 
4 BIS Review 38/2010 Settlements estimates annual wage growth at 4.1 per cent in 2009. We expect wage growth to show a further decline in 2010.  The uncertainty facing exposed industries is still considerable and wage growth among trading partners is low. A reserve of foreign labour and persons who have temporarily exited the labour force, and who may rapidly return, is probably pulling down wage growth. Wage earners’ share of income in the mainland economy is at a high level, after rising from 62 per cent in 2005 to 65 per cent in 2009. On the other hand, unemployment will probably level off at a lower level than in previous downturns, and in some sectors of the economy unemployment is still low. Wage growth is expected to move up towards the end of the projection period.  The operational target of monetary policy is low and stable inflation with annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. Over the past 10 years, inflation has on average been somewhat below, but close to 2.5 per cent. From 2003 consumer price inflation was consistently somewhat lower than the target and monetary policy was then oriented towards bringing up inflation. In 2007 and 2008, inflation edged up and exceeded the target somewhat. The key policy rate was gradually raised to a more normal level. When the outlook for the Norwegian economy abruptly changed in autumn 2008, inflation was close to target and inflation expectations were firmly anchored. The key policy rate was reduced from autumn 2008 to summer 2009 to prevent inflation from falling too far below target and to mitigate the effects of the global downturn on the Norwegian economy. The interest reduction brought the real interest rate down to a level far below normal. At the same time, households and firms could remain confident that the expansionary monetary stance would not contribute to price and wage spirals in the longer term.  In Norway, various measures of underlying inflation have been close to 2.5 per cent in recent months. Lower wage growth, reduced capacity utilisation and low global inflation have counterbalanced the effects of higher energy prices and the krone depreciation in autumn 2008. Consumer price inflation is expected to fall to somewhat below 2 per cent in 2010 following the krone appreciation over the past year.  The interest rate is set with a view to stabilising inflation close to 2.5 per cent over time and bringing capacity utilisation gradually back to a normal level. Growth in the Norwegian economy is expected to gradually pick up through the remainder of this year and next. Capacity utilisation is expected to be close to a normal level in 2011 and to reach this level in the course of 2012. In our projections, inflation gradually moves up towards 2.5 per cent around the end of the projection period as capacity utilisation reaches a normal level and the effects of the krone appreciation unwind. Wage growth shows a gradual increase. The projections are based on a gradual rise in productivity. Improved productivity will ease cost pressures for firms. The projections are also based on increased scope for firms to strengthen profitability by raising prices.  Activity in the Norwegian economy picked up towards the end of 2009. The interest rate was raised by 0.50 percentage point towards the end of the year with a view to maintaining inflation at 2.5 per cent over time. New information suggests that the recovery in the Norwegian economy is continuing, but that capacity utilisation is probably somewhat lower than anticipated in autumn 2009. Combined with lower interest rates abroad, a stronger krone and lower wage growth suggest that the interest rate forecast should be revised down somewhat in relation to the October Report.  Interest rates in Norway are low. The effect on private consumption of the substantial interest rate cuts in 2008 and 2009 has probably not been exhausted and high consumption growth is expected to continue in 2010. House prices have risen. The new guidelines for prudent residential mortgage lending issued by Finanstilsynet (the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway) may curb household debt accumulation. Over time, household borrowing may nevertheless increase considerably and saving may fall. The aim of guarding against the risk 
BIS Review 38/2010 5 of future imbalances, which may disturb activity and inflation somewhat further ahead, suggests that the interest rate should be gradually brought closer to a more normal level.  On the other hand, a marked interest rate increase in Norway and a wider interest rate differential between Norway and other countries may entail a risk of a considerably stronger-than-projected krone, resulting in inflation that is too low. This will make it difficult to bring inflation up to target within a reasonable time horizon. A strong krone may also lead to lower activity in exposed industries and thereby lower capacity utilisation in the Norwegian economy. This suggests that the interest rate should not be raised too rapidly.  Monetary policy cannot fine-tune developments in the economy, but it can mitigate the most severe effects when the economy is exposed to shocks. Overall, the outlook and the balance of risks suggest that the key rate should be gradually increased ahead, although somewhat later than we envisaged in October 2009. On 24 March, the Executive Board decided that the key policy rate should be in the interval 1½–2½ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Report on 23 June 2010 unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new major shocks. The interest rate was kept unchanged at this meeting. This is based on the assessment that inflation and capacity utilisation may for a period be slightly lower than previously projected and that the interest rate should be increased somewhat later than expected in autumn 2009.  Thank you for your attention

BIS Review 38/2010 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: Bank regulation reforms in Africa: enhancing bank competition and intermediation efficiency Keynote address by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the 12th Seminar by African Economic Research Consortium, Mombasa, 22 March 2010. *      *      * Prof. William Lyakurwa, Executive Director, African Economic Research Consortium; Senior Policymakers here present; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen; I am delighted to be with all of you here in Mombasa and to speak on Bank Regulatory Reforms in Africa: Enhancing Bank Competition and Intermediation. But before I make my remarks, let me take this opportunity to thank the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) for their invitation to give the keynote address at this seminar. This is indeed a timely topic as we continue to assess the effects of the global financial crisis and find long term solutions to mitigate and prevent recurrence. I am informed that approximately 70 senior policymakers from over 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are in attendance. This signals the importance of this seminar and the policy spin-offs it will generate. At the outset, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to recognize the important role that AERC has played in strengthening local capacity for managing economies within Sub Saharan Africa. The Consortium has contributed to advanced policy research and graduate training in economics. Most institutions of policy in Sub-Saharan Africa today are led by AERC alumni. I am happy to be part of this group myself. Ladies and Gentlemen; this seminar is taking place at a time when countries in Africa are taking stock of the second and third round effects of the global financial crisis. You will agree with me that the crisis which initially hit African countries with stronger financial linkages to international capital markets; significant trade relations with the Western world and rich natural resource countries set the stage for challenging times in policy making and implementation.  Africa’s prospects in the post-crisis period are contingent on the behaviour of policymakers. Indeed, there is need for better regulation that can readily identify emerging vulnerabilities; properly price risks; and strengthen incentives for prudent behaviour. It is tempting after the crisis to call for more regulation – but we should emphasize better regulation. Second, we should emphasize building strong institutions. Globally, the remedial actions taken by governments to deal with the crisis have borne fruit and the green shoots of recovery are beginning to sprout. For us here in Kenya, we remain committed to fostering a stable market-based financial system as mandated by law. An efficient financial system collects and collates deposits from micro-savers and channels them to investors. This is the intermediation process. This process allows economic agents to evaluate the risks and prices in the market and align their investment portfolio and investment gestation. The Kenyan case is both interesting as well as a policy strategy. It reflects a case of segmented markets. But the cost of credit and interest rates spread remains high. The spread is a major challenge in the banking sector because it acts as an impediment to expansion of credit and development of financial intermediation and signals inefficiency in the sector. The challenge for a policymaker is to develop a financial sector that answers to the challenges of the economy. In order to address market inefficiencies, the Central Bank and 
2 BIS Review 38/2010 other stakeholders have undertaken significant reforms for the banking sector. These reforms include the operationalisation of the credit reference bureaus, payment systems improvements, opening of new currency centres, automation of trading system for treasury bonds, and the activation of horizontal repos. I will spend the next few minutes to highlight these initiatives.  Operationalisation of credit referencing mechanism: The Banking (Credit Reference Bureau) Regulations were operationalised on 2nd February 2009. This will facilitate the sharing of credit information by institutions licensed under the Banking Act. This link will allow the industry to build information capital that is critical in the credit market. It will also enhance access to credit by SMEs and individuals that have been constrained by lack of physical collateral. Further, the Banking Sector will be able to address the problem of non-performing loans at the origination point as credit history of applicants will be taken into account during the credit appraisal process. Licensing of deposit taking microfinance institutions: The Microfinance Act was operationalised effective May 2008. Currently, one institution has been licensed and eight applications for license are being processed. With the unique business models of microfinance institutions mainly targeted at the lower end of the market, bringing them under the purview of the Central Bank will not only give them a legal basis in dealing with depositors but will also boost access to formal financial services by the populace. Deposit Taking Microfinance Institutions are free to be community-based or nationwide. The national payments system sits at the centre of the financial system. It is imperative that payments systems are secure and efficient. The Central Bank continues with its initiatives to modernize the national payments system. Accordingly, from 1 October 2009, value capping was effected with all payments above Kshs.1 million being made through the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS). This initiative enhanced the security and efficiency of high value payments.  The celebrated MPESA falls under this category of reforms. As we have seen this market unfolding, MPESA account holders have soared to 9 million, total transactions surpassed Ksh.48 billion a month (or averaging Ksh.1.6 billion a day) and agents increased to 17,000 in the last 3 years. Ladies and Gentlemen; on the monetary policy front, the CBK has observed that despite signalling efforts by the Monetary Policy Committee to bring down the rates of interest by lowering the Central Bank Rate (CBR), banks have not responded accordingly. Further, the failure of the banking system to extend the maturity of their loan products is a consequence of the characteristic nature of their deposits which are largely short term, but also their assessment and pricing of risk. To support economic development, there is need for the development of banking products that support long term lending. These development banking products will play a significant role in influencing a downward trend in commercial banks lending rates. The Central Bank will therefore explore how development banking products can be introduced into the market to enhance the monetary policy transmission mechanism and lengthen the maturity profile of commercial bank term loans. Developments in the bond market: The Central Bank has successfully raised funds for infrastructure development for the Government through infrastructure bonds. These infrastructure bonds have not only facilitated financing of the Government’s infrastructure program but also set the pace for the issuance of similar bonds by corporate entities such as KENGEN and Safaricom. This, coupled with automated trading in the Nairobi Stock Exchange will be important for a vibrant bond market. In addition, to deepen and widen the bond market, the Central Bank implemented the following measures:  Issuance of benchmark bonds: The Bank together with Market Leaders Forum adopted 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 year maturities as benchmark bonds. This move has not 
BIS Review 38/2010 3 only firmed up the yield curve, but has improved pricing, reflected through improved secondary market trading.  Reopening of benchmark bonds: This has increased trading activities in the secondary market.  The shape and position of the yield: The vibrant bond market has led to a downward shift in the Yield Curve with an upward gentle slope reflecting stability. This has created reliable pricing benchmark for corporates, many of who raised required capital via issuance of corporate bonds in 2009/10. It is also a useful tool in pricing credit facilities as it signals the direction of interest rates. You will recall that the Central Bank of Kenya, the Nairobi Stock Exchange and the Capital Markets Authority collaborated in the automation of trading of Treasury Bonds through the NSE. The main objective of this initiative was to make bonds trading secure, efficient and to create a vibrant market. The expected improvement in market activity will also improve market liquidity and encourage more investors to participate in the bond market. Operationalisation of the horizontal repos: We have introduced the Interbank Master Repurchase Agreement otherwise known as the Horizontal repo which is aimed at deepening the capital and money markets and enhancing the intermediation process. I am happy to note that the horizontal repo as a tool of redistributing liquidity in the market has also provided a useful barometer on the status of liquidity in the banking sector. The horizontal repo is an additional facility for commercial banks to use alongside the vertical repo which is an instrument between commercial banks and CBK. Other initiatives: The changing market dynamics in the Kenyan Banking Sector has necessitated the Central Bank to reinvent itself and become proactive in detecting opportunities and threats to financial sector stability. With a view to not only enhance intermediation and competitiveness of the banking sector but also to increase efficiency and access, the Central Bank has been in the forefront in encouraging various financial services providers e.g.  mobile phone money transfer providers such as M-PESA and ZAP  SACCOs and Agency Banking models  Shariah compliant banking products – we have seen the introduction of two Shariah compliant banks and growing interest in a number of institutions seeking to offer Shariah compliant products.  Ladies and Gentlemen; we have now started to realize the dividends of the reforms we have undertaken in the financial sector. Kenya now has a healthy, sound and strong banking system. The size of the banking system has been enhanced both in terms of deposits mobilised, credit growth and competition. Specifically:  Deposit accounts have increased from 2.6 million (end 2005) to 8.4 million (end 2009) and deposits have doubled from Ksh.545 billion (US$7.2 billion) to Ksh.1,065 billion (US$14 billion) in the same period.   Lowering barriers to entry – via removal of minimum balances has supported financial reach.  Banks have taken their services to the customers due to increasing competition and improvements in the delivery channels. Banks are opening and re-opening branches in areas with none or few branches.  Efficiency is achieved when there are strong institutions with requisite capacity to satisfy market needs while complying with statutory and prudential requirements.  Ladies and Gentlemen: One of the main challenges of monetary policy has been the presence of currency outside banks. In March 2008, it was Ksh.9 billion above the Central 
4 BIS Review 38/2010 Bank target. However, in March 2010 it was Ksh.4.9 billion below CBK target as a result of banks increased coverage of rural and low income areas.  Ladies and Gentlemen; Financial sector reforms are far from being accomplished. Given the changing dynamics of the economy and its growing complexities, the financial industry has to remain responsive and supportive of the broader economic ambitions and agenda. All the major players and stakeholders in the banking system will have to strive for continuity, broadening and deepening of reforms; build and sustain the already implemented reforms and fill the remaining gaps. The growing competition along with increasingly diversified services both across the regions and sectors, as well as improved access to customer-base on the back of progressive reliance on technology, are the harbingers of the changing and efficient intermediation role of banks in the days ahead.  The Central Bank is committed to reforms in the banking industry towards enhanced competitiveness. In line with this, the Central Bank has earmarked amendments to the Banking Act and Microfinance Act going forward. The amendments to the Banking Act and Microfinance Act are expected to further enhance efficiency and competitiveness of our financial sector. CBK in collaboration with the Government and the market players will enhance its efforts in addressing other structural rigidities that contribute to market inefficiencies to take stock of developments as well as other emerging constraints.  Before I conclude, Ladies and Gentlemen, let me once again take this opportunity to reiterate the critical role of the financial sector in Africa’s economic development. This potential can only be realized when African policymakers implement reforms to remove binding constraints in the sector. I am sure that in this gathering we have the capacity to identify those constraints to unleash Africa’s potential. Finally, I do hope that you will find time in your busy schedules to enjoy our world renown beaches. I wish you fruitful deliberations. Thank you! 
BIS Review 37/2010 1 Ben S Bernanke: Federal Reserve’s exit strategy Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 25 March 2010. *      *      * Chairmen Frank and Watt, Ranking Members Bachus and Paul, and other members of the Committee and Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve’s strategy for exiting from the extraordinary lending and monetary policies that it implemented to combat the financial crisis and support economic activity. As you know, I previously submitted prepared testimony for a hearing on this topic that was canceled because of weather conditions. I request that that testimony be included in the record of this hearing. This morning, in lieu of repeating my previous prepared statement, I would like to summarize some key points from the earlier testimony and update the Committee on recent developments. Broadly speaking, the Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis and the recession can be divided into two parts. First, our financial system during the past 2–1/2 years experienced periods of intense panic and dysfunction, during which private short-term funding became difficult or impossible to obtain for many borrowers. The pulling back of private liquidity at times threatened the stability of financial institutions and markets and severely disrupted normal channels of credit. In its role as liquidity provider of last resort, the Federal Reserve developed a number of programs to provide well-secured, mostly short-term credit to the financial system. These programs, which imposed no cost on taxpayers, were a critical part of the government’s efforts to stabilize the financial system and restart the flow of credit to American families and businesses. Besides ensuring that a range of financial institutions  – including depository institutions, primary dealers, and money market mutual funds – had access to adequate liquidity in an extremely stressed environment, the Federal Reserve’s lending helped to restore normal functioning and support credit extension in a number of key financial markets, including the interbank lending market, the commercial paper market, and the market for asset-backed securities. As financial conditions have improved, the Federal Reserve has substantially phased out these lending programs. Some facilities were closed over the course of 2009, and most others expired on February 1.1 The Term Auction Facility, under which fixed amounts of discount window credit were auctioned to depository institutions, was discontinued in the past few weeks. As of today, the only facility still in operation that offers credit to multiple institutions, other than the regular discount window, is the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which has supported the market for asset-backed securities, such as those backed by auto loans, credit card loans, small business loans, and student loans. Reflecting notably better conditions in many markets for asset-backed securities, the TALF is scheduled to close on March 31 for loans backed by all types of collateral except newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and on June 30 for loans backed by newly issued CMBS.2                                                   1  The exit from these programs is substantially complete: Total credit outstanding under all programs, including the regular discount window, has fallen sharply from a peak of $1–1/2 trillion around year-end 2008 to about $71 billion last week. 2  The TALF extends three- and five-year loans, which will remain outstanding after the facility closes for new loans. The later scheduled closing of the CMBS portion of the facility reflects the Board’s assessment that conditions in that sector remain highly stressed, as well as the fact that CMBS securitizations are more complex and take longer to arrange than other types. 
2 BIS Review 37/2010 In addition, the Federal Reserve has been normalizing the terms of regular discount window loans. We have reduced the maximum maturity of discount window loans from 90 days to overnight for nearly all loans, restoring the pre-crisis practice. In mid-February the Federal Reserve also increased the spread between the discount rate and the upper limit of our target range for the federal funds rate from 25 basis points to 50 basis points. We have emphasized that both the closure of our emergency lending facilities and the adjustments to the terms of discount window loans are responses to the improving conditions in financial markets. They are not expected to lead to tighter financial conditions for households and businesses and hence do not constitute a tightening of monetary policy, nor should they be interpreted as signaling any change in the outlook for monetary policy. The second part of the Federal Reserve’s response to the crisis and recession, besides the provision of liquidity to the financial system, involves both standard and less conventional forms of monetary policy. After reducing short-term interest rates nearly to zero, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) provided additional monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency debt. All told, the Federal Reserve purchased $300 billion of Treasury securities and will conclude purchases of $1.25 trillion of agency MBS and about $175 billion of agency debt at the end of this month. The Federal Reserve’s purchases have had the effect of leaving the banking system highly liquid, with U.S. banks now holding more than $1.1 trillion of reserves with Federal Reserve Banks. A range of evidence suggests that these purchases and the associated creation of bank reserves have helped improve conditions in mortgage markets and other private credit markets and put downward pressure on longer-term private borrowing rates and spreads. At its meeting last week, the FOMC maintained its target range for the federal funds rate at  0 to 1/4 percent and indicated that it continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. In due course, however, as the expansion matures, the Federal Reserve will need to begin to tighten monetary conditions to prevent the development of inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve has a number of tools that will enable it to firm the stance of policy at the appropriate time. Most importantly, in October 2008 the Congress gave the Federal Reserve statutory authority to pay interest on balances that banks hold at the Federal Reserve Banks. By increasing the interest rate on banks’ reserves, the Federal Reserve will be able to put significant upward pressure on all short-term interest rates, as banks will not supply short-term funds to the money markets at rates significantly below what they can earn by holding reserves at the Federal Reserve Banks. Actual and prospective increases in short-term interest rates will be reflected in turn in higher longer-term interest rates and in tighter financial conditions more generally. The Federal Reserve has also been developing a number of additional tools it will be able to use to reduce the large quantity of reserves currently held by the banking system. Reducing the quantity of reserves will lower the net supply of funds to the money markets, which will improve the Federal Reserve’s control of financial conditions by leading to a tighter relationship between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term interest rates. Notably, to build the capability to drain large quantities of reserves, the Federal Reserve has been working to expand its range of counterparties for reverse repurchase operations beyond the primary dealers and to develop the infrastructure necessary to use agency MBS as collateral in such transactions.3 In this regard, the Federal Reserve recently announced                                                  3  Primary dealers are broker-dealers that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
BIS Review 37/2010 3 the criteria that it will apply in determining the eligibility of money market mutual funds to serve as counterparties in reverse repurchase agreements. As an additional means of draining reserves, the Federal Reserve is also developing plans to offer to depository institutions term deposits, which are roughly analogous to certificates of deposit that the institutions offer to their customers. A proposal describing a term deposit facility was recently published in the Federal Register, and the Federal Reserve is finalizing a revised proposal in light of the public comments that have been received. After a revised proposal is reviewed by the Board, we expect to be able to conduct test transactions this spring and to have the facility available if necessary thereafter. The use of reverse repos and the deposit facility would together allow the Federal Reserve to drain hundreds of billions of dollars of reserves from the banking system quite quickly, should it choose to do so. When these tools are used to drain reserves from the banking system, they do so by replacing bank reserves with other liabilities; the asset side and the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet remain unchanged. If necessary, as a means of applying monetary restraint, the Federal Reserve also has the option of redeeming or selling securities. The redemption or sale of securities would have the effect of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as well as further reducing the quantity of reserves in the banking system. Restoring the size and composition of the balance sheet to a more normal configuration is a longer-term objective of our policies. In any case, the sequencing of steps and the combination of tools that the Federal Reserve uses as it exits from its currently very accommodative policy stance will depend on economic and financial developments and on our best judgments about how to meet the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. In sum, in response to severe threats to our economy, the Federal Reserve created a series of special lending facilities to stabilize the financial system and encourage the resumption of private credit flows to American families and businesses. As market conditions and the economic outlook have improved, these programs have been terminated or are being phased out. The Federal Reserve also promoted economic recovery through sharp reductions in its target for the federal funds rate and through large-scale purchases of securities. The economy continues to require the support of accommodative monetary policies. However, we have been working to ensure that we have the tools to reverse, at the appropriate time, the currently very high degree of monetary stimulus. We have full confidence that, when the time comes, we will be ready to do so. 
BIS Review 37/2010 1 Nils Bernstein: Recovering of the Danish economy and housing market developments Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Governor of the National Bank of Denmark, at the annual meeting of the Danish Mortgage Banks’ Federation, Copenhagen, 24 March 2010. *      *      * The global economy is on the mend. The upswing is fragile, and though the direction of economic indicators are not clear, the recovery seems slightly stronger than expected in the autumn. The recovery is strongest in the emerging and developing economies, while it remains slightly more subdued in Europe. The overall picture is that the economic setback has been most pronounced in regions where the financial sector has been particularly exposed to inflated asset values. The development has not yet led to a reversal in labour markets in the USA and Europe. The rebound in the international economy is primarily the result of many countries’ still very expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. The extraordinary monetary policy measures are slowly being phased out. But few central banks have begun to raise interest rates. Public finances have deteriorated across industrial countries. And most EU member states are expected to run budget deficits exceeding 3 per cent of GDP this year. This means that they hold prospects of being included in the excessive deficit procedure that focuses on consolidation and leaves little room for manoeuvre in supporting the economic upswing further, if it turns out not to be self-sustaining. The situation in Greece is in a category of its own. Lack of confidence in Greece’s ability to get its public finances on track unaided has boosted the premium on loans to the Greek government. Ireland and Latvia are examples that illustrate the scale of the measures needed to restore confidence. The recovery of the Danish economy is also expected to be slow and hesitant. The road ahead is likely to be bumpy. This year’s growth will be insufficient to halt the increase in unemployment. The corporate sector has considerable spare capacity, and unemployment is expected to rise for yet another year. Denmark is a small open economy, and about one job in four is related to exports, directly or indirectly. Wage competitiveness therefore plays an important role in the Danish economy, and the crisis has resulted in weak export markets and hence weak selling opportunities. Erosion of wage competitiveness has led to loss of market shares. The loss has been quite substantial relative to those of many comparable countries. There is a clear tendency that countries whose competitiveness has deteriorated the worst also fare worst in export markets. Collective bargaining has been finalised in a climate of rising unemployment and considerable uncertainty about the economic development. There are prospects of lower wage inflation than in previous years. Which we welcome. But there are hardly prospects of a change in the competitive environment. Changing real wage expectations after a period with a strong labour market is an uphill struggle. And it also clearly highlights the problems arising when demand reaches unsustainably high levels. *** Financial conditions are very expansionary amid historically low short-term interest rates. Adjusted for tax and inflation, the real interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is currently very low. This supports the housing market. In our judgement, the housing market 
2 BIS Review 37/2010 is slowly recovering, and price adjustments are done at the current low interest rate level. Budding optimism is seen among potential buyers. I usually refrain from official predictions of interest-rate developments. But today, I will make an exception. I am quite sure that rates on 1-year adjustable rate mortgages cannot be sustained at the current low level. I will not try to predict when it will rise. But I advise homeowners and others against stretching their budgets so tight that they can only make ends meet at the current very low interest rate level. Normalisation of interest rates and rising unemployment may present a certain risk to the development. If the low growth continues in the euro area in the coming period, the normalisation of interest rates will be postponed. By contrast, stronger economic growth could cause interest rates to rise, but in that case, unemployment will stabilise and perhaps begin to fall. Housing market developments and rising equity prices have caused household wealth to rise again. Combined with continued handsome growth in disposable incomes and more upbeat consumer expectations, this means that we take a more positive view on the outlook for private consumption. The decline in consumption during the crisis has been sharper in Denmark than in most other countries. Despite a fairly good rise in incomes. The consumption ratio has thus dipped and now stands at a very low level. This, together with general stabilisation of the economic development and the slightly positive sentiment, paves the way for the return of confidence and for households to spend the increase in disposable incomes on consumption and residential investments. However, indications for the first months of the year do not suggest a strong reversal. The low interest rates will gradually stimulate the economy over a number of years. Therefore, interest rates will have an underlying expansionary effect on the economy in the years ahead. This also applies to fiscal policy as the expansionary stance of the past years has not yet fully shown through. Initial fiscal consolidation is thus unlikely to change the picture of an economy on a slow recovery path. The fiscal challenges are now so daunting that consolidation is necessary in the coming years if we are to avoid an untenable increase in government debt. There is no avoiding it – even if there is still a great deal of spare capacity in the economy. Add to this the erosion of wage competitiveness, strong pressures on expenditure, a heavy tax burden, low productivity increases and a limited job supply. The Danish economy is facing serious challenges far beyond cyclical factors. And now over to mortgage credit. The international financial crisis has demonstrated that there is a need for financial institutions having bigger capital buffers and larger and more stable liquidity reserves. Events deemed very unlikely by risk management models did actually occur. International work is going on in order to formulate and agree on new rules addressing the problems unveiled by the crisis. It is important to reach agreement across national borders and continents, so that the conditions for financial business are largely the same irrespective of the location. For Denmark, it seems that our unique mortgage credit system can be facing challenges that we will have to deal with more or less on our own. It is therefore important that we carefully consider where to concentrate our efforts to have the new rules adjusted to our special conditions. Here I will focus on the most essential aspects as we see them today. 
BIS Review 37/2010 3 The liquidity regulation proposals include a classification of assets based on how liquid they are. Government bonds and claims on central banks, international organisations etc. are considered fully liquid, while corporate bonds and mortgage-credit bonds can only be included up to a maximum of 50 per cent. Finally, there are some assets that cannot be included. Denmark will seek to have mortgage-credit bonds included in the stock of fully liquid assets, provided their liquidity is comparable with that of government bonds. Liquidity – also in stressful situations – should be the crucial point. We believe that we can prove that Danish mortgage-credit bonds are highly comparable with government bonds. And that’s what we intend to do. Another aspect concerns adjustable-rate mortgages specifically. During the financial crisis, financial institutions generally saw their funding sources in the market drying up. This was the reason why many governments found it necessary to issue state guarantees to financial institutions. The rules now on the drawing board therefore pose requirements on stable funding. The definition of stable funding implies that Danish mortgage-credit bonds with a remaining term to maturity of less than one year cannot be included. Moreover, lending with a maturity of more than one year must be covered by stable funding. Such a rule highlights the risk associated with Danish adjustable-rate mortgages. These are 30-year loans funded via short-term bonds, primarily with maturities of one year. Every year the issuing institute will have to refinance the loan. At first, the risk can be passed on to borrowers, if they can bear it. If not, it will invariably return to the lender. We cannot ignore that there is a real risk inherent in the design of the Danish adjustable-rate mortgages. A design that implies that loans worth more than kr. 500 billion must be refinanced every year to finance 30-year loans. I will not today try to guess whether the final formulation of the Basel rules will make it impossible to maintain the adjustable-rate mortgages as we know them today. In such a situation, I find that it will be constructive if the sector itself seeks other solutions more in line with traditional mortgage-credit lending. Finally, I will make a few remarks on the Danish discussions. I understand that work is going on to ease the requirements for Danish covered bonds, if the loan exceeds 80 per cent of the property value due to declines in property prices. The so-called LTV rule. Today, the rule is that if the value of the property declines, and the covered bond loan then exceeds 80 per cent of the property value, the issuing mortgage-credit institute has to find additional collateral for the mortgage. I see little likelihood that it will be possible to requirement. And I doubt that it would benefit Danish mortgage credit in the longer run. We should not introduce the slightest doubt about the quality of Danish covered bonds. The legislation on covered bonds has provided the banks with the possibility of allowing investors in covered bonds to be secured creditors in respect of a number of assets in the banks’ balance sheets. This arrangement makes covered bonds a much safer asset than senior debt issued by a bank. The banks can therefore use covered bonds for long-term funding without this becoming prohibitively expensive. The banks can use covered bonds as a tool for better matching maturities on the asset and the liability side and thus reduce their liquidity risk. Covered bonds are therefore a funding tool, which can for example help banks comply with future liquidity regulation. Against this background, Danmarks Nationalbank does not support the idea of abolishing this possibility. On behalf of Danmarks Nationalbank, I hereby thank the Danish Mortgage Banks’ Federation for our successful cooperation during the past year.

BIS Review 37/2010 1 Thomas M Hoenig: The financial foundation for Main Street Speech by Mr Thomas M Hoenig, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, at the Capital Markets Summit: “Getting Main Street Back to Work”, US Chamber of Commerce Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, Washington DC, 24 March 2010. *      *      * The views expressed by the author do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives.  History tells us that for a country to succeed and endure economically it must adhere to a simple set of principles. No matter the market’s complexity, these principles anchor both its financial system and overall economy. And the most fundamental of these principles is a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the institutions within the system. This commitment provides a culture of sound business ethics, a confidence in the rule of law, the reliability of contracts, and a culture of fair play on a level field.  How the individual firms compete on this field is up to them. There is almost always a diversity of firms within a highly competitive and appropriately regulated commercial system. Some firms are large, many are small and all are dynamic. Those who relax, resist change, or cheat know that such lapses result in failure, which is determined by the market.  If we stray from our core principles of fairness or ignore the rule of law, we distort the playing field and inevitably cultivate a crisis. When the markets are no longer competitive, firms become a monopoly or an oligopoly and it matters more who you know than what you know. Then, the economy loses its ability to innovate and succeed. When the market perceives an unfair advantage of some over others, the very foundation of the economic system is compromised.  In these instances, for example, bonuses will far exceed the economic value provided, because the bonus is what we economists call an economic rent. It is not earned, it is only received. The protected will act as if they are protected, they will retain their status independent of performance, and the public will suffer. I like to say, “If you give someone a monopoly, they will act like a monopolist every time.”  I open with these comments because our nation today is reacting to a financial crisis and an interruption in the flow of capital. It is also now in the process of addressing its causes in an effort to prevent its recurrence. While calling for action myself, I have been uneasy with what I have seen so far. The attempts to address capital markets and their role as the “Financial Foundation for Main Street,” appear to place a much higher value on rhetoric than on substance and necessary reform.  As a nation, we have violated the central tenants of any successful system. We have seen the formation of a powerful group of financial firms. We have inadvertently granted them implied guarantees and favors, and we have suffered the consequences. We must correct these violations. We must reinvigorate fair competition within our system in a culture of business ethics that operates under the rule of law. When we do this, we will not eliminate the small businesses’ need for capital, but we will make access to capital once again earned, as it should be.  The inevitable crisis  The banking system has gone through an unprecedented era of change starting in the 1980s when lawmakers began removing the roadblocks to interstate banking. This evolution continued to pick up speed in the years that followed through a number of legislative moves that validated the creation of ever larger banks. The scope of activities continued to grow 
2 BIS Review 37/2010 through the 1990s and by the end of the decade we saw the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group. That merger required the divestiture of certain activities, but this became unnecessary with the passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The legislation allowed a single financial company to engage in commercial banking, investment banking, insurance underwriting and brokerage.  This expansion of activities, some argued, created a stronger system overall because the institutions were more diversified. For example, rather than being entirely reliant on a single community or industry, such as real estate, a stronger system was being created because banks were serving a broader nationwide base. A downturn in a single market would be offset by stability in other areas.  Although this new era of finance was widely supported, a critical ingredient was missing on the road to expansion and innovation: a framework that would limit dangerous excesses or the development of perverse incentives. Undoubtedly, the most important omission was a way to deal with the larger firms that were using the new growth opportunities to become “too big to fail (TBTF).”  Although banking legislation in 1991 specifically tried to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) ability to protect failing banks and their creditors, regulators could make an exception for large institutions whose failure might pose a threat to the economy or to financial stability. As a result, TBTF was embedded in our legal framework.  The growth of large institutions has distorted the framework of the financial system in ways other than just TBTF. Larger and more complex institutions have become more difficult to regulate and supervise. In some cases, regulators did not have the resources or authority to keep up with a growing and innovative financial system, particularly during a period when some regulatory rules were being replaced with a risk-focused supervisory system. It has been very difficult for examiners to get large banks to tighten their operations, especially when the banks were generating tremendous profits.  These large institutions wield considerable influence. An obvious example of this is the way that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were both able to game the political system after their accounting problems and avoid tighter regulation and more realistic leverage constraints.  Looking back, one sees that the crisis was inevitable, if for no other reason than that these TBTF firms would push the boundaries until there was a crisis.  In a 1999 speech on financial megamergers, I concluded that “To the extent these institutions become “too big to fail,” and … uninsured depositors and other creditors are protected by implicit government guarantees, the consequences can be quite serious. Indeed, the result may be a less stable and a less efficient financial system.”  More than a decade later, the only thing I can change about this statement is that the government guarantees are no longer just implicit. Actions during the financial crisis have made this protection quite explicit.  The results  So, what does this protection mean?  TBTF status provides a direct cost advantage to these firms. Without the fear of loss to creditors, these large firms can use higher leverage, which allows them to fund more assets with lower cost debt instead of more expensive equity. As of year-end, the top 20 banking firms held Tier 1 common equity equal to only 5.1 percent of their assets. In contrast, other banking institutions held 6.7 percent equity. If the top 20 firms held the same equity capital levels as other smaller banking institutions, they would require $210 billion in new equity or reduced assets of over $3 trillion, or some combination of both. (See attached charts.) Stated 
BIS Review 37/2010 3 another way, almost one-quarter of the assets held by these large institutions are supported by less equity capital.  Furthermore, TBTF reduces the cost of the debt that these firms issue. Due to their implied government support, ratings agencies explicitly increase the debt ratings of the largest banking organizations above the intrinsic rating that would be assigned based on the bank’s condition and the amount of leverage. Not only do these firms get to use more debt, but the debt is cheaper.  This framework has failed to serve us well. During the recent financial crisis, losses quickly depleted the capital of these large, over-leveraged companies. As expected, these firms were rescued using government funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The result was an immediate reduction in lending to Main Street, as the financial institutions tried to rebuild their capital. Although these institutions have raised substantial amounts of new capital, much of it has been used to repay the TARP funds instead of supporting new lending.  In other words, I suggest that our economy would be better served by a more diverse financial system. Certainly community and regional banking organizations were hurt by the financial crisis and recession and many of these firms are facing large losses associated with problems in commercial real estate and other lending areas. But despite these problems, many smaller banks have continued to lend. In 2009, 45 percent of banks with assets under $1 billion increased their business lending.  Policy changes  All of these events bring us to where we are today, talking about the lack of credit availability for Main Street. The good news, such as it is, is that the market is slowly correcting, and credit growth is or will begin flowing to Main Street, providing job growth and economic recovery. However, it will not be rapid or easy.  The fact is that Main Street will not prosper without a healthy financial system. We will not have a healthy financial system now or in the future without making fundamental changes that reverse the wrong-headed incentives, change behavior and reinforce the structure of our financial system. These changes must be made so that the largest firms no longer have the incentive to take too much risk and gain a competitive funding advantage over smaller ones. Credit must be allocated efficiently and equitably based on prospective economic value. Without these changes, this crisis will be remembered only in textbooks and then we will go through it all again.  As steps toward avoiding this outcome and to assure a more consistent allocation to Main Street, I have three recommendations.  First, we must enable capitalism to work and reduce the incentive of our largest financial institutions to take on too much risk by allowing them to fail in an orderly manner. This can be accomplished, but to do so, we must have a credible resolution process that forces shareholders, responsible senior management, and creditors to incur loss if the company takes on excessive risk and becomes insolvent. To be credible, the resolution regime must be independent of the political process and based on the rule of law. Only then, will creditors force these firms to operate with lower leverage. The current legislation in both houses of Congress begins to address this issue. Unfortunately, both still leave considerable room for exception in the hands of the Treasury. This needs more attention. You can find my specific recommendations on how this can be accomplished on the Kansas City Fed’s website. (www.KansasCityFed.org)  An often heard statement by many policymakers and financial market experts over the past couple years has been that if a financial firm is too big to fail, then it is too big. I couldn’t agree more. Requiring that the largest financial firms be allowed to fail when they are 
4 BIS Review 37/2010 insolvent and that they must meet at least the same equity capital levels as smaller firms will create a natural limit on the size of firms. It will also do the most for returning our financial system to one that is more efficient and equitable.  Second, we must strengthen our supervision of financial firms by returning to simple, well-established rules, such as maximum leverage and loan-to-value ratios. In an age of “markets know best” and “growth must be accommodated,” such rules were weakened in statutes and regulations. Today, we are paying the price. Leverage also tends to rise during economic expansions as investors, lenders, and borrowers forget past mistakes or come to believe that “this time it’s different.” We saw this in the years leading up to the current crisis. The acceleration of leverage and increase in loan-to-value ratios reflected a massive miscalculation that risks were low and easily manageable.  Third, we must improve the regulatory framework, which may involve reversing some of the deregulation that occurred in the 1990s. Specifically, adopting a version of the proposed Volcker rule would be healthy for long-term stability. It should (1) focus on banning financial holding companies from proprietary trading and investing in or sponsoring hedge funds, and (2) require trading and private equity investment to be housed in separately capitalized subsidiaries subject to strict leverage and concentration limitations. In addition, I strongly support increasing the transparency in financial markets by requiring standardized derivative transactions to be cleared through centralized counterparties, and to the extent feasible, traded on exchanges.  Conclusion  These reforms will encourage and serve to maintain a diverse and efficient banking system. This means a banking system that includes a healthy mix of community, regional, and large banking companies. The banking system’s diversity allows the United States to have the world’s most innovative and entrepreneurial economy, in large part, because both small and large firms are able to obtain the funding they need. The reforms I propose will promote fairness in our banking system. Fundamental principles are not anti-business. On the contrary, my recommendations are more pro-business than the current regulatory framework.  A credible resolution process, simple rules for leverage and loan-to-value limits, and the Volcker rule reforms will allow all banks to compete on an equitable basis. In the end, reinstating these fundamental principles will enhance consumer, business, and Main Street access to that most essential resource – capital. 
BIS Review 36/2010 1 Mervyn King: Uncertainty in macroeconomic policy making – art or science? Lecture by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Royal Society conference on “Handling Uncertainty in Science”, London, 22 March 2010. Accompanying slides to this speech can be found on the Bank of England’s website. David Aikman, Philip Barrett, Sujit Kapadia, Mervyn King, James Proudman, Tim Taylor,  Iain de Weymarn and Tony Yates (Bank of England) contributed to this paper. *      *      * 1. Uncertainty and public policy Most questions of public policy relate to uncertainties. Answers depend upon an ability to understand and evaluate those uncertainties. Yet many commentators and members of the public want to believe in certainties. They want to cut through the thickets of caveats and technical difficulties to the “bottom line”. We see this in economic policy, weather forecasting and the interpretation of secret intelligence. Five years ago, the Bank of England and the Met Office held an informal seminar to exchange ideas on how to communicate measures of uncertainty to the general public. Although we failed to persuade broadcasters to explore the issues of economic and weather forecasting in more depth, the bilateral relationship which developed between the Bank and Paul Hardaker, who moved from the Met Office to take over the Royal Meteorological Society, flourished. Today’s conference is a tribute to Paul’s persistence. It could hardly be more timely. At the heart of debates about climate change, the Chilcot Inquiry into the war in Iraq, and the speed of the necessary fiscal consolidation of our public finances, lie questions about how to evaluate and respond to considerable uncertainties.  At that seminar in 2005, we discussed three questions. First, in modelling the phenomenon of interest, what is the right balance between simplifying assumptions and technical rigour? Second, how open should we be about what we don’t really know? Third, in communicating uncertainty, how can we prevent the intended audience from focussing excessively on one or two parameters of the underlying distribution at the expense of the whole picture? The discussions compared the Bank of England’s fan charts for the outlook for inflation with the Met Office’s plume charts for forecasts of temperature. This paper updates that discussion, and presents some new ways of communicating uncertainty which are under evaluation by the Monetary Policy Committee. Reference to economics and meteorology is not just because the interests of some of us span both. They are two disciplines united by a common need to grapple with complex systems and communicate forecasts to a wide audience. It is not enough to explain only to experts. Much of the value of forecasts is in their being understood – in all their subtleties – by the general public, or at least sub-groups such as the agricultural industry in the case of meteorology and those involved in wage bargaining in the case of economics. The use or misuse of forecasts has caused problems for both the Bank of England and the Met Office in recent years. The Bank’s forecasts of inflation were criticised for overstating the size of confidence intervals during the period from 1995 to 2007, the so-called “Great Stability”, and then understating them once the financial crisis occurred. And the Met Office has recently announced that it will no longer publish forecasts for the weather in forthcoming seasons after it “failed” to predict the cold winter or the wet summer (in some parts of the country) last year. The seasonal forecasts will be replaced by monthly predictions. In a statement, the Met Office said, “by their nature, forecasts become less accurate the further out we look. Although we can identify general patterns of weather, the science does not exist to allow an exact forecast beyond five days, or to absolutely promise a certain type of 
2 BIS Review 36/2010 weather”. But to publish forecasts only when the outcome is virtually certain would be an admission of at least partial defeat. If descriptions of probability distributions are misinterpreted by the media or the public, how can we discover which messages are robust and which are too fragile to survive the process of communication to a wide audience? First, we need to consider how we should form a view of the likelihood of different outcomes. 2. Unpredictability in economics and science Unpredictability is a challenge faced by practitioners in many disciplines. As Kenneth Arrow, Nobel Laureate in Economics, said about his four-year experience as a weather officer in the US during World War II, “one thing I learned from meteorology is that being an actual science was no guarantee of exactness”. Economics may or may not be an actual science, but it certainly suffers when trying to predict the future. There are at least three explanations for this unpredictability that are common to economics and other scientific disciplines. First, assigning probabilities is particularly difficult for infrequent high-impact events such as financial crises, tsunamis, or climate change, for which there are few precedents. Because the samples of such events are so small, as we learn about these processes our assessment of their likelihood will change, possibly sharply. Second, even systems that are deterministic rather than stochastic can be very unpredictable. Small differences in starting conditions can imply very different outcomes. Weather systems display chaotic dynamics, so that small initial forecast errors may lead to large revisions to the forecast further out. Economists, in contrast, often rely on simple linear models, but with additive stochastic errors. In modelling any phenomenon there is a choice, and among the experts in the area often a live debate, about whether it is more useful to use deterministic but chaotic or stochastic models.1 But the motivation in both cases is to bring out the importance of unpredictability. Another feature that hinders predictability is that a priori indistinguishable shocks can have very different effects in some systems. If you drop a grain of sand randomly on a sand pile, drop a lit match at random in a forest, or infect a random person with a disease, it may have very minimal, localised effects or may lead respectively to an avalanche, wildfire or epidemic. The outcome depends on the state of the system when the shock hits (the steepness of the sand pile, dryness of the forest, or density of the population) and the precise point at which the system is hit.2 Third, systems can be subject to sudden transitions between locally stable states. In both economics and science, we can find examples of systems that have multiple stable states. And switches between these may be hard to predict. Models of the circulation pattern in the North Atlantic Ocean suggest that it can either be vigorous, helping to warm the northern hemisphere as water is transported from lower latitudes, or can shut down almost entirely. The magnetic properties of iron provide another example of a system with different stable states. When exposed temporarily to an external magnetic field, iron retains its magnetism even when the external field is removed: the same external conditions are consistent with                                                  1  See, for example, Sugihara and May (1990). 2  In relation to the latter, key nodes or players may be instrumental in the spreading of shocks (Anderson and May, 1991). This thinking has been applied to the financial system showing that a priori identical shocks can have differing effects depending on where the shock hits. And, inspired by the literature on sand piles, Scheinkman and Woodford’s (1994) model of inventory dynamics shows how small shocks may cause aggregate fluctuations. 
BIS Review 36/2010 3 different states of the system, depending on its history.3 Many economic systems also exhibit forms of hysteresis or path dependence. For example, changing social attitudes towards personal bankruptcy, inflation or unemployment may affect equilibrium outcomes for those variables. 3. Policy responses to unpredictability Predicting the precise timing and dynamics of instability in all of these settings is very difficult. It is, however, possible to identify a sand pile or forest as being prone to large scale instability and determine the factors that contribute to that instability. Analogously, many people, including at the Bank of England, did identify the vulnerabilities of the financial system before the crisis without actually being able to predict when or how the crisis would begin. Economists have been able to learn from other disciplines about how to cope with these types of instability. For example, insights from ecology and epidemiology have been applied to financial networks (for more discussion, see Haldane 2009), and economists have learned much from engineers about how to control dynamic systems. The key is for policymakers to focus on making the structure of the underlying system more robust to shocks. For example, in avalanche areas the snow may be “seeded” so that, by inducing small avalanches, the chance of a large avalanche is mitigated. And in fire-risk areas, controlled burns or fire breaks are sometimes used to limit the risk of a large fire. In the context of the financial system, policymakers could impose a “Glass-Steagall” style separation between the payments system network and risky activities. Actions can also be taken to mitigate the impact of a bad outcome. For example, this might mean building an avalanche net or fence; funding a fire-fighting service; or launching a lifeboat. In the context of financial regulation, this might entail reducing the costs associated with resolving financial institutions, for example by requiring banks to develop resolution and recovery plans, or requiring forced subsidiarisation of foreign bank branches. As always, however, there is the risk that such interventions can have unintended consequences: shortly after the Titanic sank, a steamer, the S.S. Eastland, capsized on Lake Michigan, with the loss of around 850 lives, because it had been destabilised by the extra lifeboats required by post-Titanic regulations! 4. Decision making under uncertainty and the role of beliefs The analogies between economics and science can be taken only so far. A key difference between economics and the physical sciences is the role played by active decision-makers  – such as households and businesses – whose presence complicates substantially the dynamics of the system. In particular, economic outcomes are sensitive to the way people behave under uncertainty, and to their beliefs about the past, present and future. Perceptions of uncertainty affect behaviour. If enough people are uncertain about their future job prospects and save more as a precaution, that may lead firms to cut employment, so increasing the chance that jobs are indeed lost. But uncertainty about whether it will rain today does not change the weather. Beliefs adapt over time in response to changes in the environment; and this in turn affect show economic systems behave. Because the surrounding environment can affect economic decision-making, there are probably few genuinely “deep” (and, therefore, stable) parameters                                                  3  This particular example is fortuitous for earth science and biology, since it helps us date rocks and the fossils they contain and chart continental drift, based on the history of changes in the magnetic field of the earth. 
4 BIS Review 36/2010 or relationships in economics. In contrast, in many settings in the physical sciences there are stable “rules of the game” (e.g. the laws of gravity are as good an approximation one day as the next). The study of decision making under uncertainty has a distinguished ancestry in economics. Frank Knight (1921) wrote about the difference between risk (where frequencies could be used to calculate probabilities) and uncertainty (where there was no objective basis on which to derive probabilities). Of course, a true Bayesian would assume that people would be able to construct subjective probabilities, and their behaviour would be governed by those beliefs. But Keynes (1936) made much of the pervasive nature of uncertainty in his explanation of business cycles because of the instability of those subjective probabilities. Occasional sharp changes in expectations could, and did, result. That is exactly what happened in the Autumn of 2008, with the sudden and synchronous collapse in business confidence around the world. So the behaviour of economies depends in part upon the beliefs about future events held by the various players: consumers, businesses and governments. Outcomes are endogenous to beliefs about the likelihoods of the outcomes. And in some contexts there may be self-fulfilling equilibria. Sudden shifts in beliefs are particularly relevant when many decision-makers interact. The behaviour of a bank’s depositors has many equilibria, each of which depends upon beliefs about whether other depositors are likely to run on the bank. Changes in perceptions of uncertainty may be transmitted rapidly, and amplified, with the potential to affect behaviour in a coordinated way.4 A restaurant may be much busier than an identical competitor if the first customers of the evening dine there and the next customers suspect the first may know something they don’t, and so follow, with others subsequently joining the herd. The reverse may occur on the following evening. Disentangling the incremental role of shifts in beliefs is often difficult. For example, afire sale of assets by one bank may have a mechanical amplifying impact on other banks through its effect on market prices, but could simultaneously affect other banks via confidence and beliefs, if people become less optimistic about valuations of other assets when one asset class is in distress.5 The role of beliefs and behaviour in affecting outcomes means that there is a premium on understanding decision-making under uncertainty. In economics, broadly speaking there are two approaches to modelling decision making under uncertainty: the standard, “rational” approach of “homo economicus” which assumes that beliefs are based on an efficient processing of all available information, and the “behavioural” approach, informed by the psychology literature, which highlights psychological traits that violate the assumptions underlying the “rational” view. The two approaches yield different conclusions on both the desirability of policy intervention and the form it should take. In practice, the applicability of each approach depends on the context. Rationality may be a reasonable approximation when decisions are carefully considered (perhaps because the returns to a “good” decision are high). But behavioural economists and psychologists contend that people often make decisions using simple or “fast and frugal” heuristics because of limited time, information, and cognitive capacity (Gigerenzer and Todd 1999).                                                  4  For example, Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2008) show how liquidity shocks in the presence of Knightian uncertainty can cause investors to hoard liquid assets. This occurs because all firms assume a worst-case scenario – that they will be unable to access liquidity when required – and this causes them to hoard liquidity. Alternatively when information is dispersed across a large number of people, each with a noisy signal about economic fundamentals, outcomes may be determined by an “information cascade”, the outcome of which is hard to predict (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani et al, 1992). 5  See May and Arinaminpathy (2010) for a model of the financial system which makes this distinction. 
BIS Review 36/2010 5 There is strong experimental evidence that people are subject to biases when collecting and processing information under uncertainty, and that such processing occurs only intermittently.6 The evidence suggests that people are also frequently incoherent in assessing, assigning and processing probabilities – even in highly artificial settings where information is complete – and find it particularly difficult to assess probabilities which are very low or very high, partly because there is less scope for learning in these cases. There is also evidence that, when making complex decisions or without full information, such as when deciding whether to have eye surgery, people often use rough heuristics, or go on first impressions, appearances, gut instinct or intuition. We want to highlight four main aspects of the behavioural view: (i) Perceptions of risk have been shown to be unduly influenced by recent or personal experience. After an earthquake, demand for earthquake insurance at first increases and then declines, while the probability of the next large earthquake may grow over time.7 So-called “Depression babies” seem to take less financial risk than other generations.8 Such an effect may explain why the fear of financial crises declines over time as memories of the last crisis fade. (ii) Decisions under uncertainty have been shown to be sensitive to the way questions are presented. People understand probabilities better if they are expressed in terms of natural frequencies (1 in 10,000) rather than percentages (0.01%). This is one symptom of a wider confusion over probabilistic concepts. Research by Gerd Gigerenzer and others shows that doctors, for example, are often misled by information presented in the form of probabilities rather than sample frequencies. The statement that a diagnostic test has a 5% probability of a false positive is misinterpreted more often than the statement that 5 patients out of every hundred taking the test will show a false positive.9 And this is compounded by the fact that many forecasts are not of the kind where reference back to a sample frequency is informative. Forecasts made today of the weather or the inflation rate at some date in the future are unique; they are not the outcomes of a repeated experiment. Decisions about saving for future pension provision, for example, are difficult to make the subject of experimentation, although we can learn from the experience of others. (iii) People tend to follow the actions of others. That can be an effective strategy. For example, on the game show “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?”, the “Ask the Audience” lifeline has a 91% success rate, showing that there can be wisdom in crowds.10 But experiments also show that a substantial proportion of people choose a glaringly incorrect answer to a simple question when told it is the answer others have chosen (even though the same question is answered correctly in isolation).11 In a sporting setting, goalkeepers facing penalties tend to dive, rather than stay in the middle of the goal, more than the direction of penalties suggests is appropriate.12 Such types of behaviour reflect the fact that people are unwilling to                                                  6  See the collection of articles in Kahneman, D, Slovic, P and Tversky, A (1982). 7  For example, see Palm (1995). She found that those most affected by earthquakes were most likely to take out insurance afterward. But this effect faded as time elapsed after an earthquake. 8  For example, Malmendier and Nagel (2006) report that those who experience high stock returns during their life are more likely to hold stocks and report lower risk aversion; those who have experienced high inflation are less likely to hold bonds. 9  See, for example, Gigerenzer, G and Edwards, A (2003). 10  See Surowiecki (2004). 11  See, for example, Asch (1951). 12  See Bar-Eli et al (2007). 
6 BIS Review 36/2010 risk failure by pursuing strategies that are different from the norm. The penalty of failure may be less if others fail in the same way – as Keynes pointed out was true of banks. (iv) People have excessive faith in their own judgements and are subject to confirmation bias and wishful thinking. An experiment, well known in the literature, asked respondents to report 90% confidence intervals around our estimates of a set of unknown quantities (e.g. the diameter of the moon).13 But the true answer lay outside the reported confidence intervals half of the time. This reflects a general result that people are overly confident in their own judgements. This effect suggests that there may be a tendency to understate uncertainty and could explain why the “severe” stress testing scenarios used by banks before the crisis were so mild. 5. Policy implications These observations about decision making under uncertainty in economics have implications for policy along three dimensions. First, decision making under uncertainty affects the dynamics of the economy. Some of the psychological biases discussed above can offer an explanation for “herding” behaviour and “risk illusion” (a tendency to over/underestimate likelihoods of different type of events). Taken together, these biases could offer an explanation for periodic bouts of exuberance in the economy and the financial system in particular.14 As such they should bear on our assessment of the likelihood of the range of possible outcomes. Our ignorance of how people behave under uncertainty, together with the presence of feedbacks between behaviour, outturns and beliefs, highlights some of the difficulties and pitfalls of economic policy making. Second, the recognition that beliefs and behaviour play an important role in the dynamics of the system affects the type of policy actions that are desirable. Ensuring that panic did not spread is one reason why guaranteeing all bank deposits following the run on Northern Rock in September 2007 was necessary. Third, communication is part of the policy response to uncertainty. In this respect, economic and financial systems differ from physical systems. In the latter, there is no-one listening. The control strategy in a physical system is defined by a scheme that relates the settings of policy instruments to certain features of the environment (e.g. fire left booster rocket if rocket veers to left of target). But in an economic system – because people’s beliefs about future policy actions affect their behaviour today – the control strategy has to comprise not only a plan for setting the instruments (e.g. raise Bank Rate if expected inflation rises) but also a plan to condition beliefs about how policy makers would respond in future. That involves communication. 6. Communication A communication strategy involves deciding how much information to communicate, and in what form. Revealing information entails costs and benefits. An optimal communication strategy balances those costs and benefits. Consider first the benefits. Information is valuable and can improve the quality of decisions. Many government agencies have valuable information that private citizens cannot easily                                                  13  See Plous (1993). 14  Tucker (2009) discusses how this might create a friction that could be countered through the use of so-called macroprudential instruments. 
BIS Review 36/2010 7 obtain for themselves. An example is the information collected by the Office for National Statistics on the economy and social trends. Central banks, too, may have information about the shocks hitting the economy, or about how they will be propagated, or indeed about the way in which policy is likely to respond. Provision of information about these issues may help people to reduce their forecast errors and take more informed decisions. As we discussed earlier, complex economic systems may have multiple equilibria. Movements between them depend on expectations and beliefs about others’ beliefs. That is especially so if there are strategic complementarities where the benefits of a strategy depend on the choice of strategies by others. Communication might help to coordinate beliefs so that a good rather than bad equilibrium results. Suppose that private investors begin to doubt the health of a bank which the central bank knows to be fundamentally solvent. A signal from the central bank that the bank is solvent may help to change beliefs, thus ensuring the continued liquidity and hence solvency of the healthy bank. But it may not be clear that the bank is solvent, and in practice there is often no smoke without fire. Communication may help to improve the credibility of public policy. Economic policymakers often confront the problem that a future policy setting that is optimal today is not likely to be the policy that it would be optimal to follow tomorrow. Before central bank independence, a problem for monetary policy was that a government promise to deliver low inflation was not credible. Wage and price setters knew that if contracts were based on the assumption that future inflation would be low, the government would not be able to resist the temptation to generate inflation higher than promised because that would temporarily boost employment and output. So the initial promise was not believed. Once expectations of high inflation were embedded into prices and wages, it was at that point rational for the government to tolerate high inflation, because the cost of reducing it would be a deep recession. The idea of giving central banks independent control over monetary policy was to remove this temptation to inflate.15 Communication is a potential solution to the credibility problem. If policymakers are transparent about the objectives of a policy – and the strategy to be followed in pursuit of those objectives – it will be easier to hold them accountable for their actions. This increases the incentives for policy makers to meet their objectives. Despite all these benefits, it does not always follow that more communication is beneficial. More communication can be costly and self-defeating. First, private participants face costs in collecting and processing information that could mean important messages are lost. The Bank of England could publish all of the many documents which it creates internally each month. But that would simply make it harder for the really important information to get through. Less can be more. We could have minute by minute revisions to weather forecasts or terrorism threat estimates, but that might overwhelm genuine flood or bomb warnings to which we want people to respond.16 Second, communication can sometimes aggravate market failures. Suppose the RSPB knows a secret location where rare birds are nesting. To preserve biodiversity, there may be a great benefit to ensuring the birds can nest undisturbed. If the RSPB reveals its secret, bird watchers may converge on the location. Here, less than full transparency mitigates the problem. An example in the same spirit is whether or not use by commercial banks of the Bank of England’s lending facilities should be concealed. If use of the facility were made public,                                                  15  For an exposition of the credibility problem in monetary policy, see Kydland and Prescott (1977); for an account of the benefits of central bank independence, see Fischer (1994). 16  This idea has received theoretical attention recently following the encouragement of Sims (2003). He sketches a model in which agents are “rationally inattentive”, focusing only on information which they diagnose makes an important contribution to minimising forecast errors. 
8 BIS Review 36/2010 depositors would ask themselves why it had been used: if they attached even a small probability to the possibility that the bank was in trouble, it would be rational for them to withdraw their deposits – triggering a run on the bank. Anticipating this reaction, there is a risk that banks would choose not to use the facilities. Further, some market participants might use the information that the facilities were being used to spread malicious rumours in the hope of profiting from the market reaction. Such rumour-spreading would be privately beneficial for the rumour-spreaders, but socially harmful. That is why when designing its discount window lending facilities, the Bank decided only to disclose average usage over a quarter, and then only with a lag.17 Communication of forecasts is not easy. Probabilities are hard to understand. Yet a forecast is not a number but an estimated probability distribution.18 And we cannot assume that people obtain information in a neutral form. Indeed for most people information is conveyed to them via the media which may filter out or reinterpret information. This leads to an incentive problem. Instead of simply reporting the information about future prospects made available in the forecasts, there is an incentive to summarise the prospects in a single number or to describe one part of the probability distribution in a way that makes for a good story. That suggests there is merit in trying to communicate directly to the public. Forecasts, or probabilistic statements in general, can easily be misunderstood or misinterpreted. As a result, forecasters may decide to withhold information, even when, correctly understood, there is something useful in the forecast – a case in point being the recent Met Office withdrawal of medium term seasonal forecasts. When experts retire from the field, it is left wide open to quackery – and there is no shortage of quacks whether in medicine, economics or meteorology. So there is a major challenge in explaining that, although we may not have a precise prediction of the effects of a particular policy action, nor are we wholly ignorant of its consequences. Finding illuminating ways of expressing those judgements is difficult but important. We must not pretend to know more than we do, and we must avoid the delusion of spurious precision. 7. Communication in practice: fan charts It is time to put some flesh on the bones of these abstract discussions. It is time in fact for a show – a slide show of the graphical representation of the uncertainty about future inflation which the Bank of England uses to communicate its views about the outlook. The Bank of England publishes a range of documents which describe the uncertainty about our analysis of the economy, and hence the uncertainty inherent in setting policy. Our longest-running, and perhaps the best known, is the quarterly Inflation Report, which the Bank has been producing since 1993. In it, the Monetary Policy Committee communicates its views about an uncertain future using methods that draw on the ideas discussed above. In the Inflation Report, the MPC sets out its latest projections for key economic variables. The most important of these is the projection for inflation. The Committee has a clear                                                  17  Morris and Shin (2002) study a case in which a central bank can only reveal a noisy signal. That signal, which is unavoidably inaccurate (e.g. a central bank forecast), is given an inappropriately high weight in private decisions because each private participant expects others to use it, and each wants to ensure that his action is not too far out of line with others’. This is an example where a public communication coordinates on an inferior equilibrium. Morris and Shin also show that public information can crowd out private information. By ensuring that all agents overweight public information in their decisions, that means that other agents observing those decisions can infer less from them about the private information others have that motivated them. In the limit, if everyone took decisions solely on the basis of public information, they could reveal nothing about some private information they may also have, but did not act on. 18  Dale, Orphanides and Osterholm (2008) illustrate how welfare can fall if the private sector overestimates the accuracy of central bank forecasts. 
BIS Review 36/2010 9 target to meet, set by government. Inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index, should be 2% at all times. But because interest rates take time to affect inflation, forecasts of inflation are integral to setting monetary policy. And because the MPC’s forecast is a probability distribution, rather than a single number, it is communicated in a fan chart. That depicts the MPC’s view of the probability of a range of different outcomes. Each forecast covers a three year forecast period, because that is  the horizon over which we expect the current stance of monetary policy to have  the majority of its effect. Here is an example fan chart (see http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/speeches/2010/speech432.pps). It shows the inflation projection published in the February 2010 Inflation Report. Each fan chart is conditioned on a particular path for the Bank’s policy instruments. This one assumes that Bank Rate will follow the path expected by financial markets. The MPC also publishes another fan chart conditional on a different policy assumption, namely that Bank Rate remains at its current level throughout the forecast. We believe these charts have been helpful in communicating the big picture that the MPC needs to get across. The fan chart works by showing what the Committee believes would happen to inflation if today’s economic circumstances were repeated on 100 occasions. In any given quarter in the future, CPI should lie somewhere in the red shaded area on 90 out of 100 occasions: 10 times in the darkest red band, and 10 times in each pair of lighter red bands. The darker shades refer to increasing probability densities at any given point. Of the remaining 10 out of every 100 occasions inflation is expected to lie outside the shaded part of the fan altogether. But the distribution of these tail events is not explicitly specified, as to do so would require a spurious degree of precision on the part of the MPC. The fan chart is designed to communicate specific concepts important to policy. Next, we will illustrate these using the February fan chart. But first, let’s briefly recap the recent history of inflation. Here, you can see that over the past couple of years inflation has been volatile, first rising sharply to around 5% and then falling back recently [Slide 2]. Looking ahead, the MPC felt it was likely that inflation would rise again in the first quarter of this year [Slide 3]. You can see that in this projection the entire 90% of the distribution covered by the shaded fan is higher than the last data point. Remember, though, with 10% of the distribution not specified, the MPC were not ruling out the possibility that inflation might have remained unchanged or fallen.  Since this projection was published, new data have been released for inflation in January, shown by the green marker [Slide 4]. This showed that inflation had indeed risen. So it now looks even more likely that inflation in the first quarter of 2010 will be close to the middle of the MPC’s fan chart. Thereafter, the MPC expected that inflation was more likely than not to fall back and be below target for a period [Slide 5]. You can see that the most likely outcome, shown in the darkest band, was for inflation to stay below the target at the end of the forecast period. But the MPC also saw upside risks to that projection, stemming from the possibility that the current high level of inflation might become embedded in inflation expectations, so making inflation itself more persistent. To make these risks easier to discern, the MPC also makes available charts of the cross section of the probability distribution at particular points on the forecast horizon, like the one shown in [Slide 6]. The upside risks mean that at the end of the forecast horizon, the MPC judged that inflation was as likely to be above the target as below it. We can see this in the chart, because the narrower bands towards the left hand side mean that the mass below the vertical line marking 2% is about the same as the mass above it. But why do we show our projections like this? Many other economic forecasters publish their forecast as a single, most likely outcome. In our view, this sort of forecast is not very informative, as the actual probability of it being correct is very close to zero. In contrast, the whole distribution contains much more information. What matters for policy is the entire distribution of outcomes. The fan charts are useful because they contain information relevant to the likely distribution of Bank Rate. To explain its current policy setting, and to provide 
10 BIS Review 36/2010 information on the likely path of policy, the MPC needs to communicate its judgement of the outlook as a whole. Most other central banks also try to illustrate uncertainty around their projections, albeit in slightly different ways. The European Central Bank, for example, presents its forecasts as a range defined as twice the mean absolute forecast error over the past [Slide 7]. The Federal Reserve produces projections that show the range of individual [most likely] forecasts – as viewed by each Federal Reserve Bank President and Governor. This is shown by the spread of the whiskers [Slide 8]. They also produce a measure of “central tendency” which truncates that distribution by excluding the three highest and three lowest forecasts, here represented by the boxes. This representation of the differences of view within the Federal Reserve is very different from a probability distribution of future outcomes. In our experience, communication of the uncertainty about future inflation is important in explaining monetary policy. The Swedish Riksbank adopts a similar approach to ours and use fan charts as their key tool for communicating views on the outlook. [Slide 9]. Looking back, we can see how our communication strategy has evolved in the light of experience over the past 17 years. [Slide 10] shows that even in the early days, we tried to get across uncertainty around our projections, illustrating this with a “trumpet” of uncertainty in the left hand panel. It was not until 1996 that we introduced the more sophisticated fan chart, on the right, as our main device for communicating about the outlook. As part of that evolutionary process, and to complement our projections for inflation, the MPC has also produced fan charts for activity in the economy – specifically GDP – since November 1997. Ordinarily, we have shown this as a projection for the four-quarter growth rate, which for most commentators, is the standard way of looking at GDP. [Slide 11] shows the recent data for GDP, portraying a sharp decline in output over the past two years. There are two points to highlight with this chart. First, there is a fan around the historical data [Slide 12]. That reflects the fact that economic data are frequently revised over time  – sometimes heavily. CPI, in contrast, is rarely revised. The chart shows that there is quite a lot of uncertainty about the past data. The MPC believes it is more likely than not that the current vintage of data will be revised up slightly. But the big picture of a large decline in output is likely to remain even in the mature data. Uncertainty about the past is an important component of our uncertainty about the future, and is reflected in the forward-looking part of the GDP fan [Slide 13]. The second point is that the forecast part of the chart shows that a return to growth is likely. But if you just had this chart to look at you might feel that the MPC was quite optimistic, and after a painful, deep recession it was expecting the economy to rebound. In some ways, that is true. But by itself that would be a misleading inference. The reality is that even if growth rebounds, the level of activity is still very likely to remain weak for a considerable period compared to the peak at the start of 2008. The economic environment is likely to continue to feel far from normal for some time. After all, it is ultimately the level of activity, rather than its growth rate, that matters for employment and the degree of inflationary pressure. It was precisely to draw out this point that recent editions of the Inflation Report have included an extra chart [Slide 14]. This shows the level of output corresponding to the growth chart. In practice, we have found that, even though these charts show the same information, the levels chart can be more effective at getting that big picture message across. Despite these efforts, there are still nuances that we have found challenging to communicate. The fan chart conveys a rich view of the uncertainties in the current forecast. But it does so at the cost of it being hard to see how the distribution has changed compared with the preceding forecast. So perhaps it is unsurprising that some commentators have found it hard to grasp the subtleties of our forecasts. That has led some to suggest that we publish tables 
BIS Review 36/2010 11 of key summary statistics on the same day as our forecasts – the mean, median and mode of the distribution. We fear that if we make such statistics available, all of our hard efforts to communicate the outlook as a whole get washed away in an extreme focus on point estimates. We do not want media commentators to summarise that outlook in a single number, preventing us getting the broader view across. As well as leading to over-simplification, publishing the information can also promote over-interpretation of our forecast. Whilst the fan chart represents the Committee’s probabilistic view of the future, it is important to recognise that it has only incomplete information on that distribution. We therefore should not overplay the particular parametric form of the chart. As a result, it makes little sense to place a lot of weight on particular summary statistics of the distribution. Rather, what the Committee can do is make broad statements – such as “inflation is more likely than not to be above the target”. Being more precise risks overstating the MPC’s degree of knowledge about the distribution. So the MPC’s concern is that early publication of the numerical parameters risks not only trivialising the policymakers’ overall view of the economy, but misrepresenting that view by being overly precise. The fan chart is designed to strike the right balance between these two hazards, by giving a broad brush articulation of the distribution that the Committee judges appropriate. But there is always room for improvement. So we turn to some of the ideas we have considered for providing additional information on particular aspects of the distribution, to help deal with some of these difficulties. For example, the next chart shows how the distribution has changed since the previous forecast by placing the two distributions side by side, as in [Slide 15]. This chart shows that the most likely outcome in the dark red band has shifted down compared with the earlier forecast. But that change in the most likely outcome is not reflected to the same degree in the rest of the fan chart – and that is because there has been an offsetting upwards shift in the balance of risks. This is most clearly seen by noting how the dark line is flatter than the light one on the right hand side of the chart, and steeper than it is on the left. As we discussed earlier, the aim of MPC communication is to convey useful information about the broad distribution, without being driven to spurious accuracy. There are many ways we can do this. One idea that we are investigating is to show charts of the MPC’s view of the probability that inflation will be above the 2% target at a particular point in time. This is shown in [Slide 16]. Such a chart does speak to the whole distribution, and it facilitates easy comparison with the previous forecast round [Slide 17]. But it still has the problem that it assigns a precise probability to a given outcome. A solitary Bayesian policymaker may be comfortable with that. But in reality there is no unique answer that encapsulates the collective judgement of the MPC. In the Bank’s experience, MPC members find it more important to focus on distinguishing between the different broad orders of magnitude of future events, and are less interested in debating whether something will happen 49 times out of 100 or 52 times. One answer to this tension is to describe the problem in words. But that carries its own difficulties. An alternative is to design a graphical device which prevents the illusion of spurious precision. Simple graphical changes to the chart such as [Slide 18] emphasise that the MPC’s view is not best expressed by a precise numerical for the probability. But a downside of this sort of representation is that it does not readily permit comparisons between successive forecasts. Instead, a further alternative that the MPC is considering is to present this as a “probability ribbon” [Slide 19]. This shows a range estimate of the probability that inflation will exceed target, defined by the edges of the relevant band of the fan chart. In doing so it preserves the broad impression of the Committee’s overall view, yet filters out the artificial accuracy. For 
12 BIS Review 36/2010 instance, the Committee thought that the chance that inflation would be 2% or higher in 2011Q1 was between 15% and 20%. We can once again use the February forecast to highlight a few of the key messages that the MPC wanted to communicate. In the early part of the forecast period, the probability of inflation being above the target is very high. This is because the data for inflation are well above target at present, and also because the fan chart here is relatively narrow. But the projection for inflation falls over the forecast period. This implies a fall in the probability of inflation being above target. Towards the final part of the projection, the probability of inflation being above the target rises back to being broadly one half. This chart emphasises that, in spite of the most likely outcome for inflation being below target, the nature of the distribution of risks implies that the probability of exceeding the target is about one in two. We can also combine the usual top-down fan chart with the information in the cross-sectional densities to produce a 3D fan chart [Slide 20]. The particular advantage of this chart is that it shows how the overall density changes over time. For instance, when the distribution is very narrow, such as at the start of the forecast period, the probability density at the centre of the fan is higher, simply because the MPC is more confident about its central forecast here. Overall, however, both from the point of view of how policy is determined, as well as how it is communicated, it is the broad distribution that matters. 8. Conclusions Self-confidence is infectious. It can also be dangerous. How often have we drawn false comfort from the apparent confidence of a professional advisor promising certain success only to be disappointed by subsequent performance? Uncertainty pervades almost all public policy questions. Economics and many other disciplines are united by a common need to grapple with complex systems. As the crisis of the autumn of 2008 showed, such systems can sometimes be subject to abrupt changes, the precise timing of which cannot easily be identified in advance. But policy-makers are often expected to anticipate the unpredictable. How can they retain the trust of the public while being open about the true degree of uncertainty? Or, to put it another way, what is the appropriate bedside manner for policy-makers when dealing with complex uncertain problems in a public debate? We have explained how the Bank of England tries to deal with some of those challenges in the context of monetary policy. We are sure we have much to learn, and our efforts to improve communication will continue for a long time to come.

BIS Review 36/2010 1 Ardian Fullani: Responsible finance in Albania Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the international conference “Responsible Finance in Albania”, jointly organized by the Bank of Albania, the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) Entwicklungsbank and the European Fund for Southeast Europe (EFSE), Tirana, 23 March 2010. *      *      * It is with great pleasure that I open the proceedings of this important forum entitled “Responsible Finance”. This concept is being ever-increasingly mentioned in the discussion topics and macro finance debates, in particular following the 2008 events. Participation in this forum pushed me to find an accurate definition for this concept. “Responsible Finance” can be summarized as practices that are designed to create a fair balance of interests between a finance institution and other stakeholders. In fact, my search made me realize that this concept may perhaps best describe in a single designation the wide-ranging efforts of the Bank of Albania in the last 3–4 years with respect to banking and financial supervision, monetary policy and public education. Responsible finance is an encompassing topic that affects and should be applied by all financial market players. It implies a phenomenon that goes beyond prudential supervision since it is a necessity to guarantee both the financial and macroeconomic soundness of an economy. This philosophy cannot be reduced merely to the best business principles and practices but it also summarizes the desire and goal to assist the poor groups of the population and remove poverty by providing more affordable borrowing and prudence that guarantees their economic success. Responsible finance focuses on guaranteeing the system’s customers’ rights, however the requirements and practices of responsible finance are first and foremost a guarantee for the soundness of financial institutions and therefore of the entire financial system. Responsible finance at the Bank of Albania has focused on three main directions:  Banking supervision  Transparency and accountability  Education First, responsible finance cannot be understood as a phenomenon and responsibility to be left to the market players’ own initiative. It should be grasped not merely as a right but also as an obligation of all market players. If you agree to this principle, then you should be an advocate and promoter – indeed, this is the position of the Bank of Albania as far as this is concerned. From a central bank’s point of view, responsible finance begins with sound supervision of the banking and financial system. It constitutes an obligation for the central bank to provide the savers with the right of having financially strong financial institutions and to ensure that the latter conduct their operations in line with the best business principles. The Bank of Albania has paid particular attention to financial stability by exerting an effective risk-oriented supervision on the institutions it licences and supervises. Moreover, effective supervision also encompasses the importance given to the promotion of competition and protection of customer interests. And last, but not least, the principle of responsible finance has been applied through prudential banking supervision and preservation of financial stability, harmonizing monetary 
2 BIS Review 36/2010 and fiscal policy. This principle has been considered as an integral and essential part in the monetary policy decision-making and harmonization with fiscal policy. Hence, the Bank of Albania guarantees that its monetary policy does not impair the financial soundness of banking and non-banking institutions and that of individuals; by contrast it supports these financial market players by making them part of the decision-making process. Allow me now to dwell upon the monetary policy decision-making transmission process to the public. This process is crucial to guaranteeing the maintenance of macro finance balances in an economy. In view of this, the Bank of Albania has committed to the economic and financial education of the public, viewing the undertaking of some concrete initiatives for the establishment of financial culture in the Albanian society as a necessity. However, this task cannot be performed alone; guaranteeing the balances requires the co-operation of the financial system, the private sector and the public at large in order for them to respond to the decision-making efficiently and rationally. The last two years’ events have pushed many people to discuss the consistency of efficient market theories and the ability of economic agents to be rational. Although it is yet too soon (and more time is needed) to make a full analysis of the causes behind the crisis, I have to bring to your attention some key elements that impaired the individuals’ ability and later on the markets’ ability to be efficient and rational. This is not to analyse the crisis but to understand the implications for responsible finance. It holds true that all stakeholders failed in terms of their decision-making and they made wrong, irrational and inefficient choices. But it also holds true that almost all borrowers did not have complete information on the types of credit they were borrowing or the financial instruments they were purchasing, or they were unable to understand the financial implications of their financial and monetary commitments. They were also pushed to believe that the housing prices were going up and that financial risk had ceased to exist. Unfortunately, it cannot be said the same for banks which pushed people to borrow these types of loans. Did they explain to their customers that the interest rates were only extended in time and they were not forgiven, that prices swing and that they do not remain stable? Did they provide all the necessary information? If the answer to a few of these questions is “no”, then the agents did not have the entire information available to make rational choices. And when this happens, the entire economy and the financial system along with it are severely hit. Against this backdrop, transparency does not only represent an obligation to the customer’s right to know each and every detail of a transaction, but also an obligation to the soundness of the entire financial system. Lack of transparency encumbers the transmission of information and consequently, it does not guarantee the proper conditions for the agents to be rational in their decision-making. Therefore, transparency and responsibility are needed. In order to enhance banks’ transparency to their customers in Albania, the Bank of Albania has approved the Regulations “On the minimum requirements for disclosure of information by banks and branches of foreign banks” and “On the transparency of banking and financial products and services”. I would like to note that the lack of transparency does not only appear in the form of intentional concealing of information or simply as a result of negligence, but also as a result of wrong selection of tools and means of communication. The disclosure of information in the most prompt, the best, the most efficient and the most comprehensible way is a responsibility for all market players, both for the institution to the customer and the customer to the institution. In this regard, it is with pity that I note that microcredit advertisements may be only found on the mileage boards or the amateur graffiti that smudge the national roads’ borders – the largest part of this information being the name of the institution. These institutions should build a clear communication strategy with the public with respect to the products they offer, the lending terms these products are offered, and – what is particularly important – their objectives. Transparency should entail their competitive advantages against universal banks as regards the lending terms and the assistance they 
BIS Review 36/2010 3 are able to provide considering their loan portfolio well-management. Responsible finance means that the donors should choose the best and most skilful partners to be involved in this activity, and exert their pressure so that the institutions they allocate their funds in guarantee the transparency and information required not only in memos and reports, but in the market, where it is evident and transparent for the target groups. Efficient market decision-making also needs the central bank’s transparency and responsibility, therefore the Bank of Albania has paid a great deal of attention in this respect. However, we are well-aware that transparency in information and decision-making represents a necessary but not a sufficient condition to guarantee an efficient response in economy. It often occurs – in particular in our economies – that financial illiteracy becomes a significant hindrance to market efficiency, since the economic agents may not be able to accurately interpret the information and communication of the decision-making authorities and may respond to these decisions unpredictably. This situation is similar to giving the people the appropriate tools to carry out a certain job without showing them first their function or how to operate with them. Consequently, there is no responsible finance without education. Using this reasoning, we perceive education as an obligation of governmental and academic institutions to respond to the public right to educate. Market efficiency and rationality may be guaranteed only if the entire economy (not only the economists) enjoys a minimum level of economic education. Being educated implies comprehending and interpreting the information and responding to it, however this does not necessarily mean being able to resolve every economic and financial problem by yourself. Being financially educated means knowing when it is necessary to address to the expert (the economist) in order to make better choices, after being convinced of his transparency and responsibility. This means financial responsibility in the form of an obligation to personal and social right for a long-term economic and financial prosperity. This education should not be only limited to the institutions (universities or financial system) because we do not need only economists. Economic and financial education should be addressed to the entire public in the form of a public good for all the economic agents in all possible ways. As I noted above, we have tried to educate our public through some concrete initiatives such as the publication of educational booklets, the launch of educational programmes for students, training seminars for journalists, high school teachers of Economics and social workers. In this regard, the Bank of Albania has been always active not only as regards the public education, but also in its search for partners, because when it comes to financial education there is room for everyone, in particular for the academia. It is for this purpose that we have recently established the Banking Research Institute as an opportunity for co-operation with the academia. The Albanian public lacks the weekly economic-related columns in the press, the educational classes, the public lectures, the professional assistance to the public and other similar. These are normal activities of the academia and the educational institutions in a developed world, since their primary purpose is to create public goods for the society. Social return or the social impact have now become an ever-increasingly important objective for profit-seeking financial institutions, while in our economy education is only limited to the strict and traditional classroom teaching. Analyses and comments almost always approach the criticism, and very rarely – not to say hardly ever – they approach explaining and interpreting a certain economic phenomenon. Against this backdrop, responsible finance goes beyond the financial system’s boundaries; it stretches to all the players that can and it is their responsibility to guarantee it in all possible ways. I invite all the interested players to co-operate in order to guarantee financial responsibility, providing an active contribution according to their role in economy. 
BIS Review 36/2010 1 Bandid Nijathaworn: Post-crisis challenges to emerging markets – what are at stake for central banks? Keynote address by Mr Bandid Nijathaworn, Deputy Governor for Monetary Stability of the Bank of Thailand, at the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN)/Bank of England Seminar on Macroeconomic and Monetary Policy Management, Brunei Darussalam, 22 March 2010. *      *      * First, I want to thank SEACEN, the Centre for Central Banking Studies of the Bank of England, and Ministry of Finance, Brunei Darussalam for inviting me to deliver this morning’s keynote address. The SEACEN’s advanced course and seminar have always been an important learning forum for central bankers in Asia to discuss common challenges as well as to share practical experience. So, I very much appreciate the opportunity to be speaking to all of you today.  On a personal note, it has also been a few years since I last spoke at this forum, as my responsibility at the Bank of Thailand as a deputy governor up to October last year changed from monetary policy to financial regulation and supervision. This brief tenure of overseeing financial stability, especially managing the financial system at the height of the global financial crisis, has been a valuable experience and makes me appreciate even more the responsibility, the complexity, and the challenge to central banking. And it is a reflection of this experience that I want to share with you this morning, on the post-crisis challenge to emerging economies and what are at stake for central banks. My address today will focus on three issues. The first is the lessons learned from past crises. The second is the post-crisis environment and their implications for emerging markets. And, the third is the challenge for central banks going forward.  First, the lessons learned. Those of you who have been at central banks fifteen years or more will by now have witnessed at least two major financial crises that put the task of central banks in managing the economy under the spotlight. The first is the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98, and the second is the current global financial crisis. Although the two crises share many similarities as well as exhibit important differences, they both have a common origin in globalization and in the inability of the global financial system to deal effectively with the consequences of globalization. In the Asian crisis, the origin was in external imbalance of individual economies, private sector indebtedness, currency mismatch, and a sudden reversal of capital flows. In the current crisis, the origin lay in a large global imbalance, excessive-risk taking by financial institutions, and the accumulation of large systemic risk. In the context of policy, the two crises have produced many useful lessons on what needs to be done to prevent the recurrence of crises. While there is no shortage of lessons learned, having been at the Bank of Thailand through the two crises, my own list of lessons learned comes down to four important lessons.  The first is that nobody is above crises. This is to say that crises can happen in any economy, whether it is large or small, developed or emerging, with or without a sophisticated financial system, and regardless of whether the country has a fixed or flexible exchange rate system. And once a crisis happens, the impact will be large because of the globalized nature of markets that drives the spillover and contagion. For emerging markets, this means that the risk of future crises is wide-ranging and can be both internally and externally induced. The externally-induced crisis can either be because of imprudent policy choices elsewhere or because of failures of systemically important markets or institutions. And we have seen in the current crisis, the impact from an externally-induced crisis through contagion can be as, or even more severe, as an internally-induced or a home-grown crisis. 
2 BIS Review 36/2010 Therefore, to lessen the risk of future crises, prudent and good policy choices must be made in all countries. If not, the chance of crises repeating will remain high in this globalized world because of the interdependence between economies in policies, and because of the interconnectedness of countries in trade and financial flows.  The second lesson is that, while monetary policy must remain focused on maintaining low and stable inflation environment, which is crucial for sustainable growth, it is clear from the current crisis that low and stable inflation alone is not sufficient for ensuring financial stability. This is because the risk to financial stability can come from many sources other than domestic inflation. In the current crisis, it was the housing bubble and excessive risk-taking by financial institutions that precipitated the crisis in the environment of stable prices. Therefore, to maintain financial stability, attention must be paid to all the key sources of risk and imbalance, other than price stability, that can have systemic implications for the economy’s growth and stability. This is the second lesson.  The third lesson relates to the importance of having a robust and resilient financial sector at all times. For emerging markets, this means a strong banking sector. In the current crisis, it is the strength of the banking sector that has enabled the Asian economies to cope more successfully with the impact of the global crisis. These strengths are underpinned by the sector’s strong capital base, its limited exposure to subprime-related and other toxic assets, and its low reliance on external funding. Such strength and qualities are no accident. They are the results of deliberate policies to reform the financial system, strengthen supervision of financial institutions, and revamp financial regulation, risk management, and governance after the Asian financial crisis. The point I want to stress here is that these are the qualities that helped us through the current global financial crisis and they are the qualities that we need to keep.  The fourth lesson is the benefits to long-term growth and stability that come from disciplined policy management and the pursuance of policy that enhances flexibility in the economic system. The 1997–1998 crisis has been an important lesson for Asia on this point. Disciplined policy reduces the risk of an internally-induced crisis due to policy error and provides the authorities with greater room and flexibility to deal with unexpected events or shocks. In the current crisis, the ability of many Asian economies to respond aggressively to the impact of the crisis without undermining policy credibility is a case in point.  From my own experience, policy discipline relates closely to decisions that are made with a long-term perspective. The lack of discipline more than often reflects policy that focuses overwhelmingly on short-term outcome. In economics, emphasis on short-term outcome tends to reduce volatility initially but a cost of a much larger volatility and welfare loss at a later date as the needed adjustment is postponed. A long-term perspective, on the other hand, allows the adjustment to be spread out with lesser volatility and effects on economic welfare.  Next, enhancing flexibility in the economy through policy that raises the role of the price mechanism in the allocation of resources is another crucial policy choice that can make important differences to the economies of emerging markets. Again, we in Asia learned this lesson well in the 1990’s. Since then, reform of the policy regime to increase flexibility, especially the exchange rate, has contributed importantly to greater resiliency and abilities of the economies in Asia to adjust to changes in the external environment. So, the fact that the Asian economies have done better this time is not only because of the policy response during the crisis, but also because of the policy choice that was made long time ago to increase flexibility.  Let me now turn to the second part of my talk on the post-crisis environment and the challenges for emerging markets. The challenges for emerging markets in the post-crisis world will be shaped importantly by the forces of change that will emanate in the new global economic and financial environment. Some of these forces will relate to cyclical shifts in trade and financial flows in response to 
BIS Review 36/2010 3 new configuration of risk and opportunities that arises. Others will represent a more fundamental change as the new structure of economic and financial relations between countries emerges to replace the old structure that had been dismantled by the crisis. Recent discussion on this issue has pointed to the new normal global growth, the rise of Asia, and the increased role of government in the economic system as the new economic realities in the post-crisis world. But amongst these three possible new changes, I think the most important that will have far-reaching implications for emerging economies will be the durability and the composition of global growth.  The new normality of global growth will see a lower average rate of growth, weighed down by slower growth in the advanced economies because of the balance sheet problems of households, banks, and the government. Emerging markets, on the other hand, will see a more rapid recovery and expansion, leading to what has now been described as a two-speed global economy. Implications of this two-speed economy for emerging markets will be two-fold. First, differential growth outlook will provide incentives for a reallocation of investment into emerging market assets as investors look for higher return. This will result in large and persistent capital flows to emerging markets with important implications for the exchange rate, domestic liquidity, inflation, and asset prices. Second, the two-speed economy will represent a shift in the centre of economic gravity from the advanced countries to the Asian region. But whether such shift is sustainable will depend crucially on how the transition is managed by policies in emerging markets. Chief amongst these are the exchange rate arrangement and the policy to reorient the growth driver from exports to domestic demand. Successful handling of these two issues will significantly reduce the risk and the threat to financial stability in emerging economies associated with strong and persistent capital flows. Therefore, managing this risk and growing safely in this era of new globalization will be the stake for emerging economies going forward. Let me now turn to the third and final part of my talk which is on the challenge for central banks.  The task set ahead for central banks in emerging markets, therefore, are many. First and foremost is to manage the challenge posed by the new globalization in the pursuit of price stability. Important in this context is the monetary policy framework that addresses the challenge to price stability while at the same time allows central banks to pay closer attention to financial stability. Next is the question on the role that central bank policies can play to support the economy’s transition from export-led growth to a more balanced growth. Such transition will require a redirection of economic incentives from exports to domestic consumption and investment. At a minimum, the transition will require a further strengthening of the economy’s financial system so as to ensure an efficient intermediation of resources into productive investments.  Against this backdrop, I want to leave you with a few thoughts on the challenges to macroeconomic policy that will be important for emerging market central banks going forward.  The first is monetary policy and the challenge is to have in place a monetary policy framework that can deal effectively with the threat to price stability and the need to oversee the risk of financial imbalance in this era of globalization. In the current crisis, it is clear that no particular monetary policy framework is superior in dealing with such a challenge. Nonetheless, experience of many inflation-targeting emerging economies in this crisis does demonstrate that price stability and financial stability can be preserved even in extreme financial circumstances under a flexible inflation-targeting regime. This is because, under inflation-targeting, monetary policy can be flexibly combined with macroprudential measures to address concerns on financial stability without undermining the credibility of monetary policy. The Bank of Thailand has pursued this line of flexibility since 2004. Moreover, inflation-targeting also offers flexibility in the setting of the inflation targets in terms of the choice between core and headline inflation, as well as the level of the inflation targets itself. 
4 BIS Review 36/2010 This flexibility means that monetary policy will have greater room to maneuver in responding to shocks. With this flexibility, my view is that inflation-targeting remains useful as a framework for monetary policy in emerging economies.  The second challenge is how to manage the macro-implications of large and persistent capital inflows, especially the risk to financial stability, in the context of a small open emerging economy.  At this time, this challenge is real for most countries in the region and the challenge is more demanding compared to the similar episodes in the 1990’s. This is because this time capital flows are not linked to the financing of payments imbalance in the majority of economies in the region, but are a reflection of a global phenomenon of ample liquidity worldwide. Hence, there is a potential for capital flows to be larger and more volatile, and effective management of its impact will require a constellation of policies, both economic and financial. Under inflation-targeting, a flexible exchange rate system will be a first line adjustment that can help lessen the risk to financial stability. Next, to manage the impact on domestic liquidity, it will be useful for central banks to have a variety of monetary tools to absorb liquidity and influence market conditions. But, to deal effectively with both price and financial stability, two instruments will be needed. The first is monetary policy that focuses on price stability. The second is bank regulation and effective supervision that ensure financial stability through maintaining a robust and resilient financial system. Important in this context for emerging economies is the strengthening of risk management and governance of financial institutions. Furthermore, if needed, monetary and financial policies can be further supplemented by macroprudential measures aimed at reducing procyclical behaviour in the financial system. And finally, running fiscal surpluses is an effective counter-cyclical measure to restrain the impact of demand expansion on domestic inflation and asset prices.  The third challenge is to develop and maintain a robust, efficient, and resilient financial system. As I noted earlier, a resilient banking sector is most crucial for helping the economy to adjust to the impact of external shock. An efficient financial sector will also raise the ability of the private sector to manage risk. In the last fifteen years since the Asian crisis, much has been done to strengthen the region’s financial systems. Nonetheless, much more can still be achieved in the context of financial market development, enhancing competition, and putting in place the needed financial infrastructure to help facilitate better risk management by banks and the private sector. In the Thai case, we are moving in this direction with the launch of our Second Financial Sector Master Plan last year that focuses on improving efficiency, access, and the comprehensiveness of the Thai financial sector. In general, apart from lowering the risk to financial stability through better risk management, a robust and efficient financial sector will also raise the capacity of emerging economies to generate investment from their local savings. This, in my view, is where the real issue lies in solving the problem of global imbalance.  So, this very much concludes what I plan to say to you this morning in my address. I hope it has been useful. Again I want to thank SEACEN, the CCBS of the Bank of England, and Ministry of Finance, Brunei Darussalam, for the invitation, and wish you all a successful seminar as well as a full and rewarding career at your respective central bank.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 35/2010 1 Christian Noyer: Financial stability in Europe and in the world – a French perspective Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Open podium debate on “The euro in the financial crisis – lessons and perspectives”, Copenhagen, 22 March 2010. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to be here in Copenhagen at the gate of the euro area. This makes it all the more stimulating to discuss here with you issues related to the single currency, the financial crisis and the emerging new financial order. It allows for sharing experience and perspectives, which in and of itself is valuable for policy-makers.  I would like to focus my remarks more on the emerging new financial order. More specifically, in the few minutes I have, I would like to share with you some thoughts, in a candid way, on three important policy questions.  How can we make our financial systems more resilient?  How can we reduce the procyclicality of financial systems?  How can we best address systemic risk?  Resilience  Central banks have a strong stake in the resilience of financial systems. An environment of financial stability reduces the risk that monetary policy instruments become less efficient due to frictions and volatility in financial markets.  Strong prudential standards are a certainly a prerequisite. It is now apparent that the level and quality of pre crisis capital in the banking system has not been adequate for the types of losses that have been experienced and that are expected to materialize from the broader economic downturn. Larger capital and liquidity buffers are necessary especially for trading activities.  In the Basel framework we have recently taken decisions which will lead to a much more robust and resilient banking system in the future, with both a stronger capital and liquidity base. The challenge, now, is to calibrate and phase in the new framework in a way that does not impede the recovery and does not contradict our macroeconomic objectives. In the long run, we want stronger balance sheets in the banking system. In the immediate future, disorderly deleveraging is one of the main downside risks to the recovery process. Striking the right balance, in our actions and in our communication, is important, but difficult. The top-down assessment underway in the context of the Basel committee and the FSB is trying to reach that balance. The broader point here is that the proposed reforms can have significant macroeconomic consequences and these should be factored in when designing and implementing them. While the crisis has clearly had global ramifications, its impact on financial systems was not uniform across the world. Differences in financial structures do matter. Banks remain central in our financial systems: this is especially true for continental Europe where they are responsible for more than 80% of financial intermediation. These differences suggest that we should be careful in crafting the regulatory answer to the crisis. Our experience in France is that our banks’ universal model has weathered the storm relatively well. It would be a major paradox to put in place rules which would challenge such universal models. There needs to be scope for different countries to tailor solutions to their circumstances, while at the same time doing so within a globally agreed framework.  
2 BIS Review 35/2010 Many banks have improved significantly their capital position through raising high quality capital. Yet, banks may not feel comfortable if their new capital position is barely above the new minimum. Indeed, a critical issue going forward relates to the behavior of banks with respect to capital buffers they retain on top of the existing minimum. If banks target buffers above the regulatory minimum, which is an endogenous market outcome, they may need to raise even larger amount of equity than what can be expected just looking at the current package. On the one hand we know from empirical studies that weaker capitalized banks typically exhibit weak loan growth compared to other better-capitalized banks. On the other, banks may find it less costly to adjust loan volumes and loan pricing than capital, as frictions in the market for bank capital make the latter option more expensive.  Finally, any regulatory framework needs to manage avoidance and regulatory arbitrage, and keep up with innovation and other forms of structural change. For this, a necessary, but not sufficient condition is that standards are comprehensive in coverage and consistent across jurisdictions. I am not sure, for instance, that the leverage ratio, if it was to be implemented as a compulsory instrument, would meet this double test. At the current level of accounting divergences, consistency will be very difficult to achieve. Furthermore, there is a risk that it would encourage migration of credit activities towards other – less regulated – parts of the financial system.  It is therefore important that consistency apply across standards and countries. Convergence between accounting standards is a precondition for a consistent implementation of some of the prudential reforms discussed by the Basel Committee. It is also essential that new prudential standards for banks become truly universal.  Procyclicality  Strictly speaking, procyclicality is a tendency of financial systems to fluctuate around a trend with the economic cycle.  By extension, procyclicality can encompass all “amplification mechanisms” through which an initial shock results in wider movements in asset prices, credit flows, market liquidity, and, possibly, the real economy.  Our accounting and prudential regimes have increased procyclicality in recent years. In a mark to market environment, asset prices movements quickly translate into changes in the capital base of financial institutions. This, in turn, triggers additional demand for assets and a further increase in their prices. This kind of “inverted demand curve”; where demand increases with prices, may create the conditions for deep and lasting financial instability. Addressing procyclicality caused by the regulation itself is therefore a priority.  The first line of defense against procyclicality should be the accounting framework. I strongly support the current focus on changing the accounting rules. More precisely, moving from an incurred loss model to a forward looking model is essential. We need a robust, auditable and straightforward provisioning system at the accounting level based on a forward looking model that would allow provisioning efforts commensurate with credit risks through time. This framework should also be simple, bearing in mind the ultimate objective of creating synergies between prudential and accounting standards.  The Basel Committee is working on a very comprehensive approach, which is casted in its “Principles for revision of IAS 39”. Accounting standard setters have also been working hard. I firmly believe that two steps are required going forward. One is that the IASB should follow the principles by the Basel Committee. Another is that the IASB and the FASB should adopt a common methodology regarding provisioning based on expected credit losses. This is a precondition to ensure that the G20 countries have convergent accounting systems.  Some of the procyclicality can also be trimmed through prudential regulation. Efforts to make solvency ratios potentially less procyclical are welcome and should be pursued. In particular 
BIS Review 35/2010 3 those efforts aimed at imposing a measure of risks “through the cycle” or “downturn” are useful. Other options to take some of the procyclicality off through prudential standards include a fixed buffer, which would act as a capital conservation device. I see some limitations to such an option. It is hard to see how this fixed buffer, supposed to be on top of the minimum requirement, would not be perceived as a new regulatory minimum. Also, it is very hard to see how this mechanism may not have adverse impact on banks’ share ownership. Another avenue to address procyclicality through prudential rules is by putting in place a countercyclical capital buffer. The logic is simple and, in principle, appealing: the mechanism, indexed on a macroeconomic variable, would force banks to build capital reserves when they can do so and allow them to consume such reserves in a downturn. This would be expected to ensure that banks accumulate and use self-insurance in synchronization with the financial cycle. In practice, we still need to clarify the conditions and the set up for triggering the release of surplus capital accumulated through the mechanism. Such a mechanism may not necessarily be cumulative with others and we may have to choose.  Systemic risk and moral hazard  As techniques for managing and allocating risk became more sophisticated, the network of counterparties expanded in scale and in complexity. This was, truly, a systemic change that was properly understood but not fully captured by regulators at the time. Credit and market risk was supposedly more broadly spread. But counterparty risk increased. Overall, the overall impact on financial stability may well have been negative.  There might be a temptation to assess systemic risk through a crude “size” criterion. “Too big to fail” certainly warrants special treatment. But, the position and role of even smaller or medium size actors may also put them in a situation to have a strong influence on the system’s dynamics. There is a need to account for other dimensions of systemic importance such as interconnection, complexity, substitutability. Furthermore, the “systemic” character strongly depends on circumstances, the environment and the specific features of the financial system. Drawing up an a priori list of systemically important institutions would give a false sense of certainty. It may also fuel the moral hazard associated with such firms being perceived by markets as – exactly that – systemic.  Various initiatives are currently discussed, including stronger cooperation between supervisors and, more controversially, additional capital charges. They certainly require further thorough analysis It is essential to avoid threshold effects and never forget that risks are continuous in nature, time-varying and state-contingent.  The debate about systemic firms echoes also concerns about the activities and business models of some institutions. It is especially so in countries where public intervention to rescue the financial system was on a massive scale. The presumption is that smaller and leaner financial institutions would pose less risk to financial and macroeconomic stability than larger and more diversified ones. Yet, facts suggest this cannot hold as a general lesson from the crisis. Indeed, those banks which suffered most from the crisis were precisely those which were more specialized, such as the investment banks. By contrast, large universal banks, reliant on a large deposit base, could withstand the shocks comparatively better.  To deal with systemic risks, there is a lot of merit in investigating more what I would call “market options”. Financial innovation can bring an essential contribution to growth and prosperity. It can also create significant instability. To reap the benefits of innovation and reduce its risks, we need robust and resilient financial systems and infrastructures.  In this respect, concentrating systemic risks in central clearing counterparties for the most important markets (interbank, derivatives) may bring us a long way in reducing them. Even in CCPs, counterparty risk never disappears. Clearing houses concentrate the risks and remain vulnerable to a default by a major participant. They should operate under appropriate 
4 BIS Review 35/2010 oversight in order to ensure that they are properly capitalized; maintain robust risk management practices; and meet high standards of governance. They must also not be dependent on liquidity provision by other financial intermediaries, which means they should have access, at any time, to Central Bank liquidity.  Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are a case in point. The market is very opaque and increasingly concentrated between a small numbers of institutions. Worldwide, five banks – one of which is based in Europe – account for half of the CDS market. Besides, leading CDS players trade primarily among themselves and the actual transfer of risk through CDS has become more limited. Concentration and interconnectedness have increased with financial crisis. They are sources of vulnerability, a risk for the liquidity of the market and a threat to efficient pricing.  The transparency of the CDS market should also be enhanced. Data warehouses, because they hold the register of all positions, are key players in that respect: whatever their location, they should provide supervisors and regulators with access to all the data they need to conduct effective macro- and micro-surveillance. With both a stronger market infrastructure and greater transparency, we will be in a good position to ensure that CDS provide a safer contribution to the financing of the economy.  Most of these remarks have been focused on the major and vital impetus to enhance financial regulation. I cannot conclude without mentioning that changes in financial regulation are not a panacea for strengthening financial systems and ensuring that the new financial order will be less prone to instability. What is also absolutely critical is that macroeconomic policies do not derail financial stability. As I mentioned in my introduction, there is no free lunch in being a member of a monetary union. The credibility of policies for financial stability is contingent upon the conduct of other policies. Disciplined fiscal policy is a precondition to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability.  Looking into the future, a macro-prudential policy framework could provide further rooms for maneuver. In a nutshell, macroprudential policy could alleviate some of the constraints associated with the conduct of monetary policy when faced with asset price instability. It might also alleviate the burden on fiscal policy by limiting systemic risks and thus lowering the need for state financial rescue packages. That said, in practice, developing a well-articulated macroprudential policy framework raises some challenges. I trust the benefits of addressing them are worth the impressive hard work currently underway.  Thank you for you for your attention. 
BIS Review 35/2010 1 Duvvuri Subbarao: Some issues in currency management Remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Foundation Stone laying function for the Bank Note Paper Mill, at Mysore, 22 March 2010. *      *      * 1. It is my pleasure and privilege to participate in this function for laying the foundation stone for the Bank Note Paper Mill. A special and hearty welcome to the Hon’ble Finance Minister, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, but for whose active support, the launch of this vital and prestigious project would not have been possible. 2. I want to use this opportunity to speak on this occasion to highlight the significance of paper currency, touch on the history of production of currency notes in India and then address certain issues in currency management. Importantly, I would also like to outline the importance of this paper mill that we are launching today. 3. Currency notes in circulation have increased significantly since the time RBI was established 75 years ago. The value of notes in circulation in the country has increased from about Rs.172 crore in 1935 to more than Rs.7,00,000 crore in 2009. In terms of volume, the notes in circulation have increased from 124 million pieces in 1935 to more than 51 billion pieces in 2009. In fact, after China, India is the largest producer and consumer of currency notes. 4. As the economy grows, people need more currency and other payment instruments to settle their transactions. Notwithstanding several innovations in the field of payment and settlement, common people in our country, as indeed in many other developing countries, still use paper currency for their routine financial transactions. The ratio of currency with the public to GDP which was 12 per cent in 1951 is currently around 13 per cent demonstrating that currency still remains an important mode of payment in the country. It is the Reserve Bank’s responsibility, as the sole issuer of notes, to make available good and clean notes in adequate quantity to the public. History and evolution of production of notes in India 5. Currency/bank notes are among the most mass-produced commodities in the world. The genesis of paper money is generally attributed to the token money that evolved around the 10th century in China. In India, the enthusiastic experiment by Muhammed Bin Tughlaq in the 14th century to issue token money and replace silver taka with copper, though a genuine monetary experiment, ended in disaster.  6. Use of paper money started in the West in the 17th century. However, paper currency did not catch on in India because of the political turmoil following the collapse of Mughal Empire in the 17th century. Early currency in the form of “I owe you / promissory notes” issued by banks or royal courts made appearance in India only in late 18th century. Among the early issuer of bank notes in India were Bank of Hindostan (1770–1832), the General Bank of Bengal and Behar (1773–75), the Bengal Bank (1784–91), the Commercial Bank, etc. Use of bank notes, however, became widespread only after the semi-government Presidency Banks started issuing notes, notably the Bank of Bengal which was established in 1806. These banks were established under a Government Charter and were required to observe some prudential norms like cash reserve, maximum exposure limit, limit for note issue, etc.  7. Use of official Government of India paper currency commenced in 1861 with the enactment of the Paper Currency Act. The management of currency across the Indian sub-continent was evidently a huge task, requiring creation of currency circles. The Presidency banks were made agents for issue and redemption. In 1913, the Office of 
2 BIS Review 35/2010 Controller of Currency was established replacing the Currency Department in the Government. In 1935, Reserve Bank of India was created which took over the function of note issue from the Controller of Currency.  8. Indian Currency notes were printed in England till late 1920s. Recognising that production of currency notes is a strategically important activity, the then Government of India set up a currency printing press at Nashik in Maharashtra in 1928. This was followed by the setting up of another press at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh nearly fifty years later in 1975. Meanwhile, in 1967, a security paper mill with a capacity of 1500 metric tonnes per year was established at Hoshangabad in MP. By the late 1980s, the demand for currency notes exceeded the capacity of the two Government note presses. To meet the demand-supply gap, at the instance of Government of India, the Reserve Bank established, in 1996, two currency presses – this one here in Mysore and the other at Salboni in West Bengal. These were set up through a wholly owned subsidiary of RBI viz. the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Pvt. Ltd. (BRBNMPL). By 1999, the BRBNMPL’s two new presses started working to their full capacity making the country self reliant once again in currency note printing.  Clean note policy and its implementation 9. In 1999, after sufficient printing capacity has been firmly established, the Reserve Bank adopted the “Clean Note Policy” for circulation of fairly good quality banknotes and withdrawal of unfit/soiled banknotes from circulation and their destruction. In pursuit of this clean note policy, RBI did several things. We mechanized the process of note sorting/processing and destruction of unfit notes starting in 2000-01. Recognizing that the practice of stapling of notes was resulting in disfiguration of notes, impeding machine processing and reducing their longevity, RBI issued a directive to banks under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act to stop stapling of currency notes and instead secure them with paper bands. RBI advised banks to sort notes into re-issuable and non issuable categories and reissue only clean notes to the public. Finally, RBI launched an awareness campaign exhorting public to desist from writing on the watermark window of the notes or folding or stapling the notes.  10.  As part of the mechanization and systems improvement drive, we have installed as many as 54 high speed currency verification and processing machines and 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across the country. We have advised bank branches with currency chests to equip all their chests with Note Sorting Machines and to ensure that only clean notes are reissued to the public over the counter and through ATMs. Currently, there are over 4300 currency chests well equipped with Note Sorting Machines. We also did a systems overhaul to improve productivity, reinforce safeguards and minimize errors. 11.  The above efforts resulted in credible improvements. In the two year period between September 2007 and September 2009, the accumulation of soiled notes at currency chests and issue offices has been brought down from 190 days of processing capacity to 68 days. The disposal of soiled notes increased from 7.3 billion pieces to 11.9 billion pieces. Fresh notes issued to currency chests and the public increased from 10.7 billion pieces in 2006/07 to 13.8 billion pieces in 2008/09. Fake currency/counterfeit notes 12.  Counterfeiting of money is almost as old as printing of currency. At some period in history, it was considered treasonous enough to warrant punishment by death. It was in 1650 AD that paper money was developed and counterfeiting flourished, especially within America where counterfeit money was more common than genuine money. Counterfeiters had become so skilled that when the first federal coins were issued by the US Government in the 1780s, they had the dies cut by an ex-counterfeiter. However, it was the advent of colour copiers and other electronic devices in late twentieth century that made counterfeiting easier. 
BIS Review 35/2010 3 Around the world, governments are locked in a fierce race with counterfeiters to keep that one crucial step ahead in terms of technology and security features. Governments are also tightening measures to check counterfeiting, apprehend counterfeiters and impose deterrent and harsher punishments. 13.  Data available in the public domain suggests that the incidence of counterfeiting varies across different countries. While in Australia, counterfeit notes detected were around seven pieces per million notes in circulation (2008-09), in Canada it was 76 (2008). In New Zealand, the number was a low of 0.71 counterfeits per million notes in circulation (2008-09), whereas in Switzerland it was ten. As for the euro, there was roughly about one counterfeit per 14,600 bank notes in circulation (2008). At home here in India, fake notes reported as detected by banks and fake notes found in remittances received by RBI during 2008-09 amounted to eight per one million notes in circulation. The data however does not include the counterfeits that are seized by police. The above data shows that, by an international metric, the incidence of counterfeit notes in India is not alarming. Nevertheless, counterfeiting per se is a matter of serious concern for the Government and the Reserve Bank.  14. While on the subject of estimate of fake notes, I want to make a clarification. Last year, some newspapers had erroneously quoted a figure from the Nayak Committee Report for estimates of forged currency notes in circulation. The Nayak Committee, which was set up in 1988 to go into the dynamics of currency management, did not make any estimate of fake currency. What it estimated was the projected value of notes in circulation in the year 2000 which has Rs. 1,69,000 crore. The media incorrectly reported this as the number of fake notes in circulation. 15. The Reserve Bank’s role in addressing the problem of counterfeiting lies in improving the security features of the currency notes, putting in place a system where all fake notes making entry into the banking channel are promptly detected, and raising public awareness levels. For the sake of completeness, let me list the measures initiated by Reserve Bank for addressing the menace of counterfeiting:   Awareness and publicity campaigns.   Augmenting the security features. Non disruptive withdrawal of notes in old series by replacement with notes in new series.   Use of note sorting machines in all large cash handling branches in a phased manner so that all notes are sorted before reissuing to customers. To start with, all branches, where the daily average cash receipts are more than Rs. 1 crore, will have to do this by March 2010, and those where the daily average cash receipts are between Rs. 50 lakh and Rs. 1 crore, by March 2011.   Installation of note sorting machines at select non-chest bank branches (210) by RBI on a mix of criteria viz. volume of cash handling, counterfeit detection and proximity to international border.   ATMs to be equipped with sensors for detecting counterfeit notes. Till then, banks are to ensure that the ATMs are filled only with notes that have been sorted through Sorting Machines.   Creation of Forged Notes Vigilance Cells in banks.   Formation of security committees in each state including representatives of police, banks, etc. to deal with the problem of counterfeiting.   Strengthening security systems at currency chests and more intensive supervision of chests by RBI.  16. RBI’s efforts at checking counterfeiting will be effective only if there are equally effective efforts by banks. Banks should ensure that counterfeit notes are promptly detected once they enter the banking system, and that there is prompt and accurate reporting. They 
4 BIS Review 35/2010 should ensure that only clean and genuine notes are issued through their ATMs and over the counters. As currency notes are an integral part of our daily life, we, as users, should understand the various security features of the notes. These features are prominent, and can be easily identified. Enhanced public awareness will by far be the most effective deterrent to counterfeiting. Polymer notes 17.  Cost and longevity are important issues in currency management. After due consideration, and in consultation with the Government, the Reserve Bank has decided to introduce one billion pieces of Rs 10 banknotes on polymer substrate on a field trial basis in a limited launch in five cities. While cleanliness and durability are seen as the major advantages of polymer, the carbon footprint associated with production, use and disposal of polymer notes is an important issue. Available information indicates that polymer banknotes (and the waste from production) can be granulated and recycled into useful plastic products such as compost bins, plumbing fittings and other household and industrial products. Considering the relatively longer life of polymer notes and their amenability to re-cycling, the “carbon footprint” of polymer notes vis-à-vis paper banknotes is likely to be on the plus side. Regardless, this is one of the issues that we will study during the pilot phase, and will embark on polymer notes on a long term basis only if the cost-benefit calculus is decidedly positive in all dimensions.  Why we need this paper mill 18. It should be a matter of pride for all of us that the entire requirement of the country’s currency needs – this year’s estimate is of 17 billion pieces – is printed within the country. However, for the main raw material required for this – the banknote paper – we are heavily dependent on imports. The existing facility at Hoshangabad meets just 5 per cent of our requirement. We need to significantly increase our self-sufficiency in this regard for a number of operational, economic and strategic reasons. Producing our own paper is decidedly cheaper, and importantly a check against counterfeiting. The banknote paper market is a strong oligarchy. India’s demand for banknote paper – 18000 MT per year – is huge in international terms, and on the supply side there are just 3/4 large producers. This situation exposes us to vulnerabilities of a suppliers market in terms of price, quantity and timelines, something that we should avoid or at any rate minimize.  19. It would be pertinent to note that major countries viz. USA, Japan, China, Brazil, Russia and countries in the euro area and even smaller countries like South Korea, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan make their own bank note paper.  20.  It was in this background that the Government and the Reserve Bank of India decided to set up a banknote paper mill with an annual production capacity of 12,000 MT as a backward linkage in the process of note printing. The proposed paper mill is a joint venture between the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Ltd. (BRBNMPL) and the Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd. (SPMCIL), the two agencies which are collectively responsible for printing of all currency notes in the country. 21. This plant in Mysore for which the Finance Minister is laying the foundation stone today will be a state of the art production unit that will showcase to the world India’s capacity to produce banknote paper conforming to the best international quality and security standards.  22. I wish the project and the people behind its implementation all success. Once again, a very warm welcome all of you to this foundation stone laying function. 
BIS Review 35/2010 1 Usha Thorat: Milestones of bank note production in India Welcome address by Ms Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Chairperson of the Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited (BRBNMPL), at the foundation stone laying ceremony of the Banknote Paper Mill, Mysore, 22 March 2010. *      *      * 1. Hon’ble Finance Minister, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, Governor. RBI, Dr. Subba Rao, Members of Parliament, Shri A. H. Viswanath and Shri Dhruv Narayana, Members of Karnataka Legislative Assembly, Mayor of Mysore Shri Purushotham, Directors on the Boards of BRBNMPL and SPMCIL, distinguished guests and staff of the BRBNMPL – a very warm welcome to all of you to this traditional city of Mysore. 2. It is my proud privilege to welcome this distinguished gathering on this occasion of laying of the foundation stone for a Banknote Paper Mill here in the premises of BRBNMPL. It is even more significant that this project is being inaugurated in the platinum jubilee year of the Reserve Bank of India. On behalf of Reserve Bank of India, BRBNMPL and SPMCIL, I warmly and respectfully welcome the Hon’ble Finance Minister who has kindly accepted our invitation to lay the foundation stone for the Banknote Paper Mill. Sir, we are greatly honoured to have you here with us today. Today is indeed a milestone event in the indigenization of the production of bank notes and your presence here is a source of enormous strength and encouragement in ensuring the fruition of this dream. Our heartfelt thanks to you for having made it convenient to come. To us it reflects your commitment and support. We also recall with pride that it was during your tenure as Finance Minister in the mid 1980s that the proposal for the new note printing presses of RBI at Mysore and Salboni were approved. I may add that it is the first time any FM has visited the BRBNMPL.  3. It gives me great pleasure to welcome Governor, Dr. Subbarao, without whose guidance and support this project could not have been possible. I also extend a warm and cordial welcome to the Members of Parliament, the Members of Karnataka Legislative Assembly, the Mayor of Mysore, senior officials from Government of India, Karnataka Government, Directors of SPMCIL and BRBNMPL, my colleagues from the Reserve Bank of India and the staff of the BRBNMPL, other dignitaries and each and every one of you who have honoured us by gracing this historical occasion.  4. The Banknote Paper Mill is a joint venture between the BRBNMPL and the SPMCIL. Security Printing & Minting Corporation of India Ltd. (SPMCIL), a wholly owned company of the Government of India, was incorporated in January 2006 and represented the corporatisation of all the security printing and minting activities that were being done departmentally. Bharatiya Reserve Bank Note Mudran Private Limited (BRBNMPL) was established by Reserve Bank of India as its wholly owned subsidiary on 3rd February 1995 for undertaking the production of bank notes in India. 5. There are several advantages in this paper mill being set up in the premises of the BRBNMPL’s press. Besides adequate land, basic infrastructure and surplus residential quarters are already available in the BRBNMPL’s premises. Cotton, which is the principal raw material is available nearby from and around Coimbatore. 6. Going ahead, we are targeting to commission the first line with 6000 MT capacity by the latter part of 2012 and eventually achieve full capacity of 12000 MT in another year or so. The estimated pay back period is 4/5 years. With the cooperation of the Centre and State Government and others concerned, we are confident that these milestones can be achieved.  
2 BIS Review 35/2010 7. Today, I would like to recount the reassuring response of Shri Pranab Mukherjee to a query in an interview1 he had with “The Tribune” some years ago. On being asked as to what have been our (India’s) strong points, Shri Mukherjee replied: “We have built up a huge infrastructure, industrial and human. We have the largest number of technically and technologically competent personnel. We have the third largest reservoir of human talent in the world. In purchasing power parity we have the fifth largest economy …” We are encouraged and inspired by your confidence in the nation’s capabilities. We assure you Sir, this Mill, the foundation stone of which you are laying today will live up to your expectations. With these words, I once again extend a warm welcome to the Hon’ble Finance Minister and to each one of you and seek your blessings for the success of this project. Thank you.                                                  1 http://www.tribuneindia.com/50yrs/pranab.htm. 
BIS Review 34/2010 1 Thomas M Hoenig: Are community banks important? Speech by Mr Thomas M Hoenig, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, at the American Bankers Association Government Relations Summit, Washington DC, 18 March 2010. *      *      * As a Federal Reserve Bank president, I am occasionally asked outrageous questions regarding central banking and commercial banks. “Is the Federal Reserve owned by a European banking cabal?” “How much ownership of the Federal Reserve do the Rockefellers hold?” But over the past few days, the questions have become truly outrageous: “Will the regional and community bank model survive in the future?” Are community banks important? “Shouldn’t the Federal Reserve supervise only the very largest banks and not community banks?” What’s more, it is particularly bothersome to me that these last two questions are most often asked by individuals who have not been in or know what a community bank does. So let me answer the question. Whether you are here today representing JP Morgan or the First State Bank of Hometown, Kansas, the answer is the same. When you cut through the fog, there is no question as to the need for and the importance of community banks in our nation’s financial system. The maps on the screen behind me show that banks with less than $10 billion in total assets hold substantial market share in much of the United States and hold the majority of deposits in 16 states. Bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies with less than $50 billion hold the majority of deposits in 26 states. As you can see from these maps, regional and community banks serve local markets, and in turn, support local economic growth. These banks rely on knowing their customer, and managing those relationships to work with borrowers through good times and bad. Regional and community banks are also typically locally owned and managed, which means they have an immediate and vested interest in the success of their local communities. Yes, regional and community banks also are under pressure from this crisis, and it will be a struggle for them to regain their footing; but, certainly no more so than that for our largest institutions that received significant government support. Commercial real estate will be a drag on earnings for some quarters yet, and there will be bank failures. But this segment of the industry will recover and its model, with its focus on relationship banking, will prosper as the economy recovers and expands. Interestingly, looking at preliminary data, I suspect future analysis of this crisis will find that regional and community banks during the crisis actually may have done a better job of serving their local markets and maintaining lending standards. While this group of banks has a higher concentration of commercial real estate to capital, there is evidence that they are working effectively, and in some instances, more cooperatively than the largest banks with their borrowers to work out or reduce losses, based on their knowledge and active monitoring of customers. Some of our largest banks would be well-served to take a lesson. It is also no coincidence that with breakdowns in other parts of the marketplace, a substantial portion of regional and community banks have increased their loans to businesses. During 2009, 45 percent of the banks with under $1 billion in assets increased their business lending. 
2 BIS Review 34/2010 And while it may make some of the largest banks uncomfortable to hear this, regional and community banks have managed all this while operating at a competitive disadvantage. For it is the largest financial firms that have an implicit, recently made explicit, guarantee that taxpayer dollars will be used to protect them from failure, regardless of what risks they assume. It is only now that we are discussing legislation to address the issue of a special class of the largest firms that we have deemed too-big-to-fail. This is the one item that must be addressed if we are to have any real competitive equity among all financial institutions. What is proposed may need to be strengthened, but it is a start. Let me end my remarks by quickly commenting on the Federal Reserve’s role as a supervisor of regional and community banks, something that will soon come under debate in the Senate and perhaps again in the House. The strong opposition to removing the Federal Reserve from regional and community bank supervision, voiced by myself and others from the Federal Reserve, is not driven by the idea of simply protecting our “turf” or saving Federal Reserve jobs. The record very clearly shows that the Federal Reserve System has made important changes to its operations when such moves benefit the country as a whole regardless of the impact on the Federal Reserve. Most notably, the Federal Reserve was among the strongest supporters of Check 21 legislation, while realizing it would mean the eventual loss of thousands of Federal Reserve check processing jobs. The legislation improved the efficiency of our payments system, and while it was painful for me personally to see the elimination of hundreds of jobs in my District, it was a step we had to take to best serve the nation.  In this case, however, serving the best interest of the nation does not mean reducing the Federal Reserve’s supervisory role. Given the importance of 6,800 regional and community banks located in almost as many communities across this country, it is inconceivable to me that the Central Bank of the United States would not have a role in their oversight, through the supervision of state member banks and bank holding companies. The Federal Reserve System was designed by its founders with the goals of it supervising a broad cross section of U.S. banks, assuring equitable access to the Federal Reserve liquidity facilities regardless of institutional size or location, and contributing to the stability of the financial system – not only on Wall Street but on America’s Main Street. It does this job well. In the crisis of the ‘80s, which affected both large and small banks, banks supervised by the Federal Reserve proportionately imposed the least losses on the FDIC when they failed relative to banks supervised by other Federal agencies. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s role in supervision of banks and bank holding companies provides it critical information on local economies in places such as Muskogee, Okla.; Santa Fe, N.M. and Scottsbluff, Neb. And to answer the question: yes, our role in regional and community bank supervision supports our responsibilities as members of the Federal Open Market Committee, by expanding our understanding of local and regional economies. Stripping the Federal Reserve of its responsibility for supervising regional and community banks and bank holding companies should be unacceptable to anyone who cares about equity in the nation’s banking system, largest to smallest bank, and the nation’s regional and local economies. Confining the Federal Reserve’s supervisory role to only the largest firms will, I fear, inadvertently make the Federal Reserve the Central Bank to the largest firms while disenfranchising the other 6800 banks. The map tells the story. When Congress created the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago, it gave us a decentralized system that spanned the continent. The explicit purpose for this structure was to better balance the interest of Main Street against those of Wall Street. Recent experience confirms that this structure is as important today as then, perhaps more so. Community banks are important to the banking system and to the economy, and therefore continue to be important to the Federal Reserve. I have said before but it deserves repeating: It would be a 
BIS Review 34/2010 3 tragic irony if the outcome of this crisis is a gain in power for the largest firms at the expense of the other 6,800 regional and community banks. If so, it would be a win for Wall Street.      
BIS Review 34/2010 1 Ben S Bernanke: Preserving a central role for community banking Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Independent Community Bankers of America National Convention, Orlando, Florida, 20 March 2010. *      *      * I’m glad once again to be able to meet with and speak to the Independent Community Bankers of America. I greatly value the chance to hear directly from you about the challenges you are facing today. As everyone in this audience knows, those challenges are daunting indeed, and they go far beyond parochial concerns. Communities all over America are trying to cope with the economic consequences of the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression – high unemployment, lost incomes and wealth, home foreclosures, strained fiscal budgets, and uncertainty about the future. Because community banks are integral to local economies, you have been on the front line, so to speak, deeply engaged in confronting those problems and uncertainties. Your commitment to your communities, including your willingness to provide credit and services supporting small businesses, home purchases, and commercial development, is reason to be optimistic about our nation’s ability to meet the current challenges and return to economic health. One of America’s economic strengths is its relatively greater reliance on bottom-up rather than top-down growth and development, in which individual creativity, local knowledge, and the trust born of longstanding relationships help foster economic creativity and progress. Of course, it is precisely the ability to foster bottom-up growth, building on local knowledge and relationships, that sets community banks apart from other financial institutions. It is important for our economic health to maintain a diverse and resilient financial system in which community banks play an important role. As the crisis has shown, one of the greatest threats to the diversity and efficiency of our financial system is the pernicious problem of financial institutions that are deemed “too big to fail.” I will spend some time today discussing the efforts the Federal Reserve and other policymakers are making to put an end to the too-big-to-fail problem and thus help foster effective competition in financial services. I also want to speak today about the links between your institutions and mine. The Federal Reserve has always had a special relationship with community banks. As we turn from crisis management to supporting the economic recovery, that relationship will become more important than ever. Toward a more competitive, efficient, and innovative financial system The United States has a financial system that is remarkably multifaceted and diverse. Some countries rely heavily on a few large banks to provide credit and financial services; our system, in contrast, includes financial institutions of all sizes, with a wide range of charters and missions. We also rely more than any other country on an array of specialized financial markets to allocate credit and help diversify risks. Our system is complex, but I think that for the most part its variety is an important strength. We have many, many ways to connect borrowers and savers in the United States, and directing saving to the most productive channels is an essential prerequisite to a successful economy. That said, for the financial system to do its job well, it must be an impartial and efficient arbiter of credit flows. In a market economy, that result is best achieved through open competition on a level playing field, a framework that provides choices to consumers and borrowers and gives the most innovative and efficient firms the chance to succeed and grow. Unfortunately, our financial system today falls substantially short of that competitive ideal. 
2 BIS Review 34/2010 Among the most serious and most insidious barriers to competition in financial services is the too-big-to-fail problem. Like all of you, I remember well the frightening weeks in the fall of 2008, when the failure or near-failure of several large, complex, and interconnected firms shook the financial markets and our economy to their foundations. Extraordinary efforts by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and other agencies, together with similar actions by our counterparts in other countries, narrowly averted a global financial collapse. Even with those extraordinary actions, the economic costs of the crisis have been very severe; but I have little doubt that, had the global financial system disintegrated, the effects on asset values, credit availability, and confidence would have resulted in a far deeper and longer-lasting economic contraction. It is unconscionable that the fate of the world economy should be so closely tied to the fortunes of a relatively small number of giant financial firms. If we achieve nothing else in the wake of the crisis, we must ensure that we never again face such a situation. The costs to all of us of having firms deemed too big to fail were stunningly evident during the days in which the financial system teetered near collapse. But the existence of too-big-to-fail firms also imposes heavy costs on our financial system even in more placid times. Perhaps most important, if a firm is publicly perceived as too big, or interconnected, or systemically critical for the authorities to permit its failure, its creditors and counterparties have less incentive to evaluate the quality of the firm’s business model, its management, and its risk-taking behavior. As a result, such firms face limited market discipline, allowing them to obtain funding on better terms than the quality or riskiness of their business would merit and giving them incentives to take on excessive risks. Having institutions that are too big to fail also creates competitive inequities that may prevent our most productive and innovative firms from prospering. In an environment of fair competition, smaller firms should have a chance to outperform larger companies. By the same token, firms that do not make the grade should exit, freeing up resources for other uses. Our economy is not static, and our banking system should not be static either. In short, to have a competitive, vital, and innovative financial system in which market discipline encourages efficiency and controls risk, including risks to the system as a whole, we have to end the too-big-to-fail problem once and for all. But how can that be done? Some proposals have been made to limit the scope and activities of financial institutions, and I think a number of those ideas are worth careful consideration. Certainly, supervisors should be empowered to limit the involvement of firms in inappropriately risky activities. But even if such proposals are implemented, our technologically sophisticated and globalized economy will still need large, complex, and internationally active financial firms to meet the needs of multinational firms, to facilitate international flows of goods and capital, and to take advantage of economies of scale and scope. The unavoidable challenge is to make sure that size, complexity, and interconnectedness do not insulate such firms from market discipline, potentially making them ticking time bombs inside our financial system. To address the too-big-to-fail problem, the Federal Reserve favors a three-part approach. First, we and our colleagues at other supervisory agencies must continue to develop and implement significantly tougher rules and oversight that serve to reduce the risks that large, complex firms present to the financial system. Events of the past several years clearly demonstrate that all large, complex financial institutions, not just bank holding companies, must be subject to strong regulation and consolidated supervision. Moreover, the crisis has shown that supervisors must take account of potential risks to the financial system as a whole, and not just those to individual firms in isolation. Implementing supervision in a way that seeks to identify systemic risks as well as risks to individual institutions is a difficult challenge, but the fact is that the traditional approach of focusing narrowly on individual firms did not succeed in preventing this crisis and likely would not succeed in the future. Consequently, we at the Federal Reserve have been working with international colleagues to require that the most systemically critical firms increase their holdings of capital and liquidity and improve their risk management; and we are overhauling our supervisory framework for 
BIS Review 34/2010 3 the largest institutions, both to improve the effectiveness of consolidated supervision and to incorporate in our oversight a more comprehensive, systemic perspective. The second component of the strategy to end too-big-to-fail is to increase the resilience of the financial system itself, to reduce the potential damage from a systemic event like the failure of a major firm. For example, the Federal Reserve has been leading collaborative efforts to improve the clearing and settlement of credit default swaps and other derivatives and to enhance the stability of markets for repurchase agreements. Limiting the fallout from the failure of a major firm is not only directly beneficial in a crisis, it also helps to reduce the too-big-to-fail problem, because the government has much less reason to intervene if it believes that the financial system is resilient enough to handle a significant failure without excessive disruption. Third, because government oversight alone will never be sufficient to anticipate all risks, increasing market discipline is an essential piece of any strategy for combating too-big-to-fail. To create real market discipline for the largest firms, market participants must be convinced that if one of these firms is unable to meet its obligations, its shareholders, creditors, and counterparties will not be protected from losses by government action. To make such a threat credible, we need a new legal framework that will allow the government to wind down a failing, systemically critical firm without doing serious damage to the broader financial system. In other words, we need an alternative for resolving failing firms that is neither a disorderly bankruptcy nor a bailout. A prototype for such a framework already exists – namely, the rules set forth in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 for dealing with a failing bank. As the FDIC is now able to do with a failing bank, the government should, under appropriate circumstances and with appropriate safeguards, be able to seize and wind down a failing, systemically critical firm. Institutions should not be permitted to receive assistance while open, but authorities must be empowered to sell, merge, or break up an institution as necessary to avoid a disorderly unraveling that threatens the financial system as a whole. The resolution agency should not be allowed to protect shareholders and other capital providers and it should have clear authority to impose losses on debt holders, override contracts, and replace managers and directors as appropriate. If, in the end, funds must be injected to resolve a systemically critical institution safely, the ultimate cost must not fall on taxpayers or small financial institutions, but on those institutions that are the source of the too-big-to-fail problem. I don’t want to understate the difficulties of creating an effective resolution framework for large, interconnected firms. Such firms can be extraordinarily complex, both in terms of their legal structure and in the range and sophistication of their activities. The resolution of large institutions whose operations span many countries poses particular challenges, as legal frameworks vary across countries, and the authorities in each country naturally seek to protect the interests of depositors and creditors in their own jurisdictions. We must also recognize that such resolutions might well take place in the context of a broader crisis, in which the government might be forced to address problems at multiple firms simultaneously. Careful planning is therefore essential. An idea worth exploring is to require firms to develop and maintain a so-called living will, which will help firms and regulators identify ways to simplify and untangle the firm before a crisis occurs.1                                                   1  See Daniel K. Tarullo (2009), “Supervising and Resolving Large Financial Institutions,” speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers Conference on Cross-Border Insolvency Issues, New York, N.Y., November 10. 
4 BIS Review 34/2010 The Federal Reserve and community banks The Federal Reserve and community banks have much in common beyond our mutual concerns about the too-big-to-fail problem. Our interest in community banks has its roots in the founding of the Federal Reserve in 1913, nearly a century ago. President Woodrow Wilson and the other founders of the Fed, taking note of two previous failed attempts to establish a U.S. central bank, intentionally avoided creating a single, monolithic institution located in Washington or New York. Instead, they established a system of 12 Reserve Banks located in major cities around the country. (It was a federal system – hence the term, “Federal Reserve.”) Why was America’s central bank given this unique structure? The reason was to provide legitimacy and a broad geographic presence across the nation for an institution that often has to make difficult decisions. Over time, this structure has provided the Federal Reserve with grassroots connections, local insights, and diverse perspectives that few other federal institutions enjoy. We are always looking for opportunities to interact with and learn from community bankers. Events like this one are an important venue for exchanging ideas, as I’ve mentioned, but there are many others. For example, community bankers sit on our Federal Advisory Council, which meets with the Board of Governors for three mornings each year to discuss developments in the economy and in the banking industry. We meet on a similar schedule with a second official council, the Thrift Institutions Advisory Council, which brings together thrifts, saving banks, and a variety of other depository institutions, most of them smaller, from around the country. In addition, community bankers sit on the boards and the advisory councils of the Fed’s 12 regional Reserve Banks and 24 Reserve Bank branches. Both the Board and the Reserve Banks organize regular meetings involving community banks and a range of other participants. For example, the Reserve Banks are meeting with community bankers, community development organizations, and other stakeholders to discuss barriers to and opportunities for extending credit to small businesses. Of course, many of our regular interactions with community banks arise from our oversight of bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that choose to join the Federal Reserve System. This supervision is guided by the Board, but conducted day-to-day by the Reserve Banks and their examiners, many of whom have lived and worked within the Districts they serve for many years. We believe this approach ensures that Federal Reserve supervision of community banks is consistent and disciplined but also reflects a local perspective that can take account of differences in regional economic conditions. For example, in the Midwest, where many community banks specialize in agricultural lending, Federal Reserve examiners maintain a special expertise in the agricultural economy and the associated lending practices. They also draw frequently on the expertise of regional and agricultural economists in the Districts to maintain an up-to-date understanding of local conditions. So while many bankers tell us that Federal Reserve examiners are analytical and tough, few tell us that they are unfair or uninformed about what’s going on in the local economy. We believe that this kind of response speaks to the effectiveness of our supervisory program for community banks, and we take pride in the professionalism and quality of our community bank examiners. One particularly valuable aspect of our federal structure is that, over the years, it has provided policymakers in Washington with a way to keep in close touch with the continent-spanning, highly varied economy of the United States. When I attend board of directors meetings at regional Reserve Banks, which I do regularly, one of the most interesting portions is the go-round, during which each director provides his or her perspective on local economic developments. Quite often, the directors who are community bankers provide some of the most valuable contributions. That fact should not be surprising. By their nature, community banks interact with many parts of the area economy – consumers, small businesses, large businesses, real estate developers, even local governments. This breadth of vision, together with a good sense of the underlying economic forces at work in each locality, gives community bankers a unique perspective on the developments in their part of 
BIS Review 34/2010 5 the country. When the Fed analyzes economic developments, of necessity we rely on official economic data to identify broad national trends. However, the official data often mask the diversity of the U.S. economy; moreover, the data are inherently backward-looking, telling us what happened in the past quarter or year. In contrast, the grass-roots information that we obtain from community bankers and the other community and business leaders who serve as Reserve Bank directors provides a forward-looking perspective on economic developments and concerns, as well as a level of detail and qualitative insight that is often lost in the aggregate numbers. Our contacts with community bankers also provide critical insights into the state of our nation’s banks. Because of the remarkable diversity of the U.S. financial system, a supervisory agency that focused only on the largest banking institutions, without knowledge of community banks, would get a limited and potentially distorted picture of what was happening in our banking system as a whole. Close connections with community bankers enable the Federal Reserve to better understand the full range of financial concerns and risks facing the country, such as the current difficult problems in commercial real estate lending and the impediments to small business lending. For example, recent patterns in commercial loan growth are very different at large and small banks, and our links to community bankers help us to better understand these trends. The community banking perspective is also critical as we try to assess the burden and effectiveness of financial regulation. As a group, community banks are also important to the nation’s financial stability, a particular focus and responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Although it was not the case in the current crisis, instability can be generated by small institutions as well as by large ones – as occurred in the Great Depression or in the thrift crisis, to cite two particularly dramatic examples. Additionally, as a lender through our discount window to community banks and other depository institutions, we rely on information and expertise obtained from our supervisory responsibilities to lend safely, particularly in times of stress. For all these reasons, our supervisory relationships with the state-chartered banks that have joined the Federal Reserve System are immensely valuable, as is the range of contacts we have with community banks. Conclusion I know that community banks, with their special strengths, can flourish in a system that provides fair competition; indeed, many of you have stepped up during a difficult time to provide credit to support the economic recovery. To create a more competitive system, as well as a safer one, we need to end the too-big-to-fail problem once and for all. We will continue to focus on this issue, and we welcome constructive ideas from all quarters. We at the Federal Reserve look forward to maintaining our long-standing relationships with community bankers. You bring us insights into the banking industry and the economy that we can obtain nowhere else. And as the recovery progresses, we expect that you will continue to aid the nation’s return to prosperity by making good loans to creditworthy borrowers in your communities. We want to continue to work with you to help you play this important role. In doing so, together we will help ensure a bright future both for our economy and for community banking. 
Tarisa Watanagase: The international monetary system Remarks by Dr Tarisa Watanagase, Governor of the Bank of Thailand, at the Executives’ Meeting of East Asia-Pacific (EMEAP) – Eurosystem High Level Seminar, Sydney, 10 February 2010. *      *      * Liquidity challenges after the crisis While advanced countries at the epicenter of the global financial crisis had to adopt unconventional measures, Asian economies did not face liquidity crunch, hence no need for unconventional measures. In the case of Thailand, our financial institutions have relied entirely on local deposits and not encountered any liquidity problem. Nevertheless, for contingency, the central bank expanded the list of collaterals that can be used to get liquidity from the central bank.  As for the international liquidity, there are bilateral central banks swap lines readily available and IMF’s Flexible Credit Line was also a welcomed prompt response. As you know, Asia also has the Chiang Mai Initiative or CMI, which serves to anchor confidence through the psychology channel.  On the broader global liquidity issue, there is the Triffin Dilemma view that the issuer of an international currency can take the advantage of such a special status to stimulate domestic demand and liquidity in the global market. I will return to this point in the later part of my remark.  Lessons learned from the Asian crisis  From my first-hand experience in dealing with the Asian crisis, I believe that it is important to go back to the origin of the vulnerabilities, be it liquidity or solvency problem.  On reflection, I think that the latest global crisis that originated in advanced economies is very similar to that of the Asian crisis a decade ago, particularly the boom-bust cycle caused by excess liquidity. And, in the aftermath of this crisis, advanced countries are taking the path of responses that Asian countries took over the past ten years.  Allow me to put into perspective this similar path of crisis responses, so that we can see more clearly what needs to be done individually and globally.  Experience of Thailand and Asia  In the Asian case, Thailand in particular, premature opening of the financial sector with the opening of offshore banking units led to excessive capital inflows that could not be effectively arrested by the high interest rate policy, given the fixed exchange rate regime and lack of effective policy tools. The macroeconomic mismanagement was aggravated by lax supervision of financial institutions and the lack of adequate risk awareness by the public and private sectors. All these factors led to asset price bubbles that eventually burst.  But, the Asian financial crisis has made Thailand a very different place a decade later with much stronger economic resilience, together with significant progress of regulatory and institutional reforms. Today, our macroeconomic policy framework has emphasized not only monetary stability but also financial stability with a broader and more in-depth surveillance that now covers household, financial, and real estate sectors.  This strengthened surveillance framework has allowed us to take pre-emptive macroprudential measures to tackle potential imbalances in specific sectors before they BIS Review 34/2010 1 
develop into significant vulnerabilities. In parallel, our financial sector regulations and supervision have been strengthened significantly, aimed at ensuring that financial institutions and markets take prudent risks and have enough buffer to cope with potential systemic risks.  Countries in Asia have progressed on the same path I mentioned after the Asian crisis. In addition to the individual efforts, another important development is the regional efforts on precautionary measures. The latest development of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization also helps bridge the gap between the IFIs and emerging market economies on the liquidity arrangement and timely disbursement.  What is still ongoing is the establishment of a regional surveillance unit for ASEAN+3 that will facilitate the prompt disbursement of these liquidity facilities and provide us with a better understanding of risk and vulnerabilities in the regional context.  Global crisis: addressing root causes would be the same as the Asian crisis  Looking back at how far Asia has come from the crisis has put into perspective the recent global crisis and policy responses.  In my view, this past crisis was also caused by a combination of excessive liquidity, and inadequate surveillance and supervision of both the regulated and shadow banking sectors in advanced countries. Too much trust was placed on the market mechanism, which was proven to have failed. As in the case of sub-prime markets, risk awareness was not adequate by suppliers and demanders of financial instruments and no preemptive action was taken despite some very risky characteristics. The responses by crisis countries to prevent the next crisis were no different from what Asian economies did more than ten years ago. The calls made by the G-20 Leaders include putting more focus on financial stability, strengthening financial sector regulations and supervision, enhancing surveillance mechanism at both individual and international levels, especially more effective surveillance role and liquidity support by the IFIs, particularly the IMF, just to mention a few important initiatives. Please allow me a few comments on a few issues that I’d like to highlight.  What has been done and what more needs to be done  Effective surveillance: being good global citizen  One of the immediate responses to the crisis has been to strengthen effective surveillance capacity at national and international levels. We are of course on the right track in this effort to create a more robust and effective surveillance system with a view to ensuring timely policy actions. Tackling the problem at an early stage not only helps lessen the chance that micro shocks can adversely affect the macroeconomy, but also safeguards against spillovers from one country to the rest of the world.  In today’s globalized world, this spirit of good global citizenship is essential. Hence, on financial sector surveillance, I support the idea that all systemically important economies need to participate in financial sector surveillance or FSAP, including the stress testing, to support the global surveillance objectives.  As for the overall global surveillance, we need more effective role of the IFIs, in particular the IMF. Effective surveillance means the capacity to ensure right policy actions by the public sector and sufficient risk awareness and management by the private sector so that policies and market responses generate positive feedbacks. Underpinning effective surveillance is of course the credibility and legitimacy of the governance structure of the IFIs. In this regard, I believe that we all need to be sincere in pushing for continued improvement of the IMF for it to be a truly credible and effective organization for surveillance.  2 BIS Review 34/2010 
Dealing with the inherent instability: developing deep and broad financial markets and a multi-currency system  I’d like to emphasize that even if we have achieved all the above and embraced good global citizenship, it is almost certain that there will be the next crisis. But, hopefully, this will not happen in the immediate future, and it will perhaps come from different sources of vulnerabilities. So, it is imperative that both the public and the private sectors remain very vigilant and risk-focused in identifying the changing nature of risks and new sources of vulnerabilities.  The last point I’d like to touch upon is on the vulnerability in the current international monetary system. Let me return to the Triffin Dilemma discussion mentioned earlier. As the issuer of an international currency can take advantage of its special status to overly stimulating domestic demand, this leads to excess liquidity in global market and can undermine the stability of the international monetary system in the end. However, whether the current vulnerability in the international financial system lies in the Triffin Dilemma or policy blunder is an on-going debate.  Regardless of the nature of the vulnerabilities, it is clear that there have not been enough high quality financial assets in relation to financial investors’ demand. This is a factor that no doubt has contributed to the underpricing of risk and more importantly, a high degree of concentration in US financial assets, which have the most liquidity.  This point is especially important because when the global economy resumes its normal path and when emerging market economies further accelerate their growth and development, it is without doubt that wealth will once again accumulate. This will result in greater global resources searching for investment in global financial markets.  Therefore, I believe that there is a need to have more financial and capital markets that are deep and broad enough to have the acceptance of investors to help absorb the increased wealth and provide alternatives for quality investment globally. Looking around, some emerging market economies are certainly in a good position to further develop their financial markets in that direction. This is consistent with the concept of risk diversification.  Over the longer term, the instability, whether inherent or not, would decline if we have more developed financial and capital markets and also, by default, a multi-currency system as they reduce the risk concentration on one individual financial market and currency.  Conclusion  In closing, I believe that policymakers over the world need to focus our effort on all aspects of policy challenges in parallel including surveillance, financial market developments, regulations, and risk management. I strongly believe that market players respond to policy incentives and therefore policymakers have the responsibility to put the right policy and incentives in place.  There is no quick fix and it will take a long time and painful adjustment before countries that were at the epicenter of the global crisis can resume normalcy. In Asia, we have taken a decade to strengthen our economic resilience. Because of our past efforts, we have been able to weather this crisis relatively well.  That said, our work in Asia is still ongoing to strengthen the policy framework and tools to deal with future crisis that will surely not be the same as the last. Importantly, we are mindful that the world will have much less fiscal space to cushion potential global contraction, should the next crisis hit.  While it may be easier to advance these efforts at the national level, achieving policy coordination on the global level will be much more difficult. Time, spirit of cooperation and BIS Review 34/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 34/2010 good global citizenship, as well as maintaining policy and risk focus will be essential for all of us going forward.  Thank you. 
Ioannis Papadakis: Combatting the impact of the financial crisis Welcome remarks by Mr Ioannis Papadakis, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the European Bank Coordination Meeting, Athens, 19 March 2010. *      *      * It is an honor and a pleasure to welcome you to Athens for the European Bank Coordination Meeting, hosted by the Bank of Greece and co-organized with the European Commission, the IMF and the EBRD. Moreover, I am very pleased to be given the opportunity to share with you some preliminary thoughts on the achievements of our efforts to support IMF programs in the region through concerted private sector involvement. The financial crisis that erupted in 2007 is now in its third incarnation. Having started as a crisis affecting certain marginal financial markets in the US, it subsequently spread fast with its impact being felt on the financial and the real sectors of most economies in the world. In its current incarnation, it is turning into a fiscal crisis, as markets realize the true cost of the measures implemented to minimize the damages and the impact on the macroeconomy. In addition, the crisis has brought to the fore a number of weaknesses and deficiencies in the functioning of the international financial system, putting the effectiveness of the supervisory and regulatory framework under the microscope. The discussion regarding the origins of the crisis and the work that needs to be done has created a long list of “do’s and don’ts”. It has also led to an even more lively and lengthy discussion about the appropriate means to achieve the ultimate goal and the timing of the required measures. Let me briefly mention five areas of action, which I believe deserve priority:  First, there is need to deal effectively with short-termism in the quest for high profits, by protecting the system from the incentives created by excessive bonuses and the irrational pricing of risks.  Second, the transparency of financial markets and structures needs to be enhanced by putting greater emphasis on risk disclosure by systemically important institutions, instruments and markets.  Third, the pro-cyclicality of the financial system needs to be mitigated by improving both the quality and quantity of bank capital and by ensuring that banks create enough prudential liquidity buffers in good times to have reliable shock-absorbers on which to depend, if and when bad times come.  Fourth, there is a need for a macro-prudential approach to financial supervision that takes into account not only the links between financial behaviour, economic activity and macroeconomic policies (e.g. the crisis triggered a freefall in economic activity that called for policy relaxation, the exit from which could postpone economic recovery), but also the interconnectedness between financial institutions, markets and cross-border activity.  Last but not least, the whole system of checks and balances must not breed complacency in any of the actors involved, as the crisis has shown that tail events may be rare but are still possible. With the benefit of hindsight, it would not perhaps be too unfair to say that the initial policy response to the crisis was timid and to some extent reluctant. Soon however, in the face of such unprecedented challenges, governments, national central banks, international financial institutions and supervisory and regulatory authorities around the globe all demonstrated a remarkable unity of purpose. The extraordinary magnitude of the crisis led to the acceptance that extraordinary measures were needed, if a repeat of the 1930s was to be averted. In BIS Review 33/2010 1 
order to forestall the impact of the crisis, policy makers deployed both conventional instruments (such as cutting key policy interest rates and increasing public spending) as well as a battery of non-conventional ones. I would add, if I may, that intellectually this has been an exciting period, as we were often driven to think outside of our usual toolbox. Indeed, sometimes we were forced to think the unthinkable, as we realized that in crisis situations the accepted wisdom is not always wise. Even more importantly for our purpose, we all came to realize that in our globalized world “no country is an island.” International interrelationships are today so strong that no country can go it alone in the open seas. This has led to enhanced international efforts to coordinate through both existing and new arrangements. The international financial institutions have played a catalytic role here. We must acknowledge this and thank them for it. The institutions themselves accepted that the magnitude of the crisis was such that it could not be addressed by any of the actors acting alone. The European Bank Coordination initiative started just a little over a year ago as an ad hoc effort to stabilize the flow of funds to a few economies in Central and Eastern Europe. It has now attained the stature of a successful coordinating mechanism, which is worth keeping and, when appropriate, replicating in other parts of the world. This initiative of ours has achieved an admirable coordination between the official and the private sector. The mere fact that so many diverse actors were brought together to act in a consensual way for the common, as well as their own, good is an encouraging indication that the international community has matured. After years of endless theoretical discussions on the potential merits of private sector involvement in crisis management and resolution, the EBCI emerged almost spontaneously as the appropriate response to actual and acute problems. Coordinated international assistance to countries that both needed and deserved it has been crucial for mitigating the impact of the crisis. For example, the balance of payments support packages by the IMF and the EU to six European countries have helped to deflate the mostly exaggerated market concerns about the fundamental viability of the region’s economies and banking sectors. The size and firmness of such a wide commitment is what acted as a catalyst to mitigate and reverse the negative mood toward particular countries in the region. The precision and timeliness of our mutual commitments is what marked the turning point that brought us back from the brink of a fully fledged regional crisis in late winter 2008/early spring 2009. Given the importance of foreign-owned banks for the region’s financial sectors, our co-ordination was pivotal in addressing the reversal of capital flows and in dampening the economic cycle. The precise and firm commitment by each and every one of the parties involved allowed us to promptly address potential co-ordination failures, shape a macro-prudential approach for dealing with the impact of the crisis on the region and, by doing so, enhance the efficiency of the policy measures taken by each individual country. We at the Bank of Greece are proud to have been supportive of this initiative, right from its inception. Needless to say, we shall continue to support it whatever the circumstances. As the initiative now stands, we are even in position to successfully tackle the details where the devil often lurks. For example, how should the need for adequate external financing and reserves build-up be balanced with the need to strengthen financial stability and avoid excessive lending expansion. The European Bank Coordination initiative owes much of its success to the efforts made by each and every one of us. What we have achieved so far provides us all with the impetus to continue our efforts towards more and better cooperation in concert. Here in Europe, the Memorandum of Understanding of 2008 among the supervisory authorities is already fostering better and deeper cooperation, while the creation later this year of a new institutional framework for financial supervision and regulation will also provide a firm basis for effective coordination. What we all wish and strive for is the enhanced and long-lasting stability of the European and, ultimately, the international financial system. 2 BIS Review 33/2010 
BIS Review 33/2010 3 I congratulate you all for your good efforts over the last year to bring about and safeguard stability in the countries involved. I thank you for participating in today’s meeting. The Bank of Greece as host owes a special thanks to the European Commission, the IMF and the EBRD for the help they have provided us in organizing today’s event. I wish you all a fruitful meeting and a pleasant stay in Athens. 
Paul Tucker: Resolution of large and complex financial institutions – the big issues Remarks by Mr Paul Tucker, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, at the European Commission Conference “Building a Crisis Management Framework for the Internal Market”, Brussels, 19 March 2010. *      *      * Many thanks for input to Mark Adams, Andrew Bailey, Peter Brierley, Geoffrey Davies and Andrew Hewitt, and to Financial Stability Board colleagues for discussions on resolution issues. For background work to Michael Grady and for secretarial support to Sandra Bannister and Cheryl Feeney. I am delighted to be at today’s conference, the first major conference under Commissioner Barnier. As many colleagues here will know, I chair the Financial Stability Board’s Working Group on Cross-Border Crisis Management. But my remarks today are offered in a personal capacity, albeit drawing on the international dialogue. The conference is very well timed given the Commission’s work on a possible EU directive on resolution regimes. An increasing number of national authorities have already established or are prospectively establishing Special Resolution Regimes for the resolution of commercial banks, enabling the transfer of deposits and good assets to another bank, with bad assets and other creditor claims going into an insolvency process. At a high level of generality, a distressed bank is split into a continuing good bank, typically acquired by a healthy bank; and a gone-concern bad bank, which goes into administration. Insured deposits travel with the “good bank”. All other creditors typically travel with the “bad bank” and become claimants in the insolvency. We can be confident that this will help to buttress stability. Encouragement from the EU to all members states to establish such regimes would be really useful. But we also know that, of itself, this is insufficient. It cannot cope with distressed LCFIs (“large and complex financial institutions”) without injections of public money. In the first place, every country having its own Special Resolution Regime does not solve the problem of resolving cross-border banking groups. Second, such regimes cannot cope with investment banking, whether national or global, if a buyer cannot be found. Even for a (hypothetical) LCFI operating entirely within a single jurisdiction, with all of its counterparties, customers and contracts domiciled there, a standard resolution regime could not effect an orderly run down of, for example, a massive, complex derivatives portfolio. Putting over-the-counter derivatives though central counterparties would help. But it would not securely solve the problem. Today I want to surface those big issues, and to encourage the EU and the international community more generally to explore possible solutions. In doing so, I take our objectives to be twofold: (i) First, to avoid a disorderly disruption to the provision of financial services to the economy in the event of firm distress; (ii) And second, to put market discipline back into the system, by having losses fall to uninsured creditors as well as to equity holders, and without public sector solvency support. Bluntly, the challenge is how to sustain the provision of financial services during a crisis without the state bailing out uninsured creditors. BIS Review 33/2010 1 
Handling LCFI complex derivative/trading portfolios Some types of business activity, particularly complex trading, do not lend themselves at all well to the standard resolution tools I summarised just now. Not least, unwinding a derivatives book is especially complicated; it typically requires dynamic hedging to preserve value, and that would be very hard indeed in a liquidation. Counterparties flee. Funding flees. The Lehman and AIG experiences demonstrate this. So, in a different context, does the time it took Berkshire Hathaway to wind down the complex derivatives portfolio of its Gen Re subsidiary; years, not months. What can be done? One route, suggested by those examples, would be for the authorities to finance the wind down of complex trading positions, in what would be in effect an analogue to US-style debtor-in-possession financing. The authorities would be preferred creditors. That kind of approach could be used either briefly, in order to bridge to an insolvency procedure, which would amount to putting a framework around the kind of operation the NYFed mounted for a week or so to contain disruption from the failure of Lehman’s US broker-dealer. Or, alternatively, it could in principle be used over a prolonged period, to finance the run off of a whole book. In either case, however, it would expose the authorities to risk of loss, and so would not always deliver the Objectives I think we share. It would not be assured to preserve orderly markets in all cases. And it would be insufficient if a firm was actually insolvent. A quite different, and rather more profound approach would be to deploy a super special resolution framework that permitted the authorities, on a rapid timetable, to haircut uninsured creditors in a going concern. By haircutting creditors in a going concern, there would be no need to close the business immediately (or, if regulators wished, even at all). That is a very high-level description. Variants obviously exist. Instead of haircuts, uninsured creditors could have part of their claim converted into equity. And it would need to be clear how the regime applied to the normal ranking in the capital structure, with common equity and subordinated debt being wiped out before any senior unsecured debt was haircut (or converted) at all. Precisely because investment banking is highly levered, relatively small percentage haircuts (or conversions to equity) could materially recapitalise a distressed firm. Creditors would recapitalise distressed LCFIs, not the state. In that, it shares some features of contingent-capital bonds, but would be on a statutory basis and could apply to all unsecured creditors in the extreme circumstances of systemic distress. The crucial feature is that haircuts/conversion would be applied up front to creditors of a going concern. By contrast, under standard commercial-banking resolution regimes, the “bad bank” goes into an insolvency process as a gone concern, with de facto haircuts applied to its creditors ex post, after realisation of the assets by the liquidator – a process that almost always destroys value. A “going concern” approach would in effect combine features of standard regimes for resolving commercial banks (rapidity, public policy objectives) with some features of the US Chapter 11 for non-financial companies (haircuts for creditors in a continuing business). Of course, the kind of super-special resolution regime I am airing could not be an exact replica of Chapter 11 – if only because the capital structure of a distressed LCFI would have to be restructured very quickly, over a weekend if not overnight, and so could not rely on a negotiated settlement with creditors. For that reason alone, in common with the existing commercial-bank resolution regimes, there would plainly need to be safeguards.1 Perhaps the most important might be that such                                                  1  For safeguards in the UK SRR, see the Banking Act 2009 (Restrictions of Partial Property Transfers) Order 2009 (SI2009/322). 2 BIS Review 33/2010 
super special resolution powers could be applied only where the authorities made a formal determination that the firm’s distress would otherwise seriously threaten systemic stability. The modalities would, I suspect, end up varying according to countries’ particular circumstances. In some, the financial authorities might decide the scale of the haircuts/conversions; perhaps in other countries, it might be thought that a senior judge should decide on the basis of an application by the financial authorities. It is also worth saying that maintaining an LCFI in business through such means would neither preclude nor of itself require regulatory action against management or, once the crisis had passed, to wind-down parts or all of the business over time. Nor would a regime of the broad kind I have sketched exclude restructuring banking groups into functional subsidiaries, with different resolution tools applied to, say, deposit-taking/payments; custody and global cash management; the business of illiquid lending to small and medium-sized enterprises and households; trading/derivatives business or wholesale banking more generally. That would not be inconsistent with reducing the number of legal entities in LCFI groups, perhaps by an order of magnitude. The current FSB-sponsored work to develop “recovery and resolution plans” for the top 25 or so LCFIs is designed to identify where those kind of steps are warranted. Resolution could, therefore, take its place alongside structure and regulation as one of the key elements of a reform package to strengthen the global financial system. A super-special resolution regime along those lines would, on the face of it, go quite a long way towards reintroducing market discipline – by putting uninsured creditors at risk even in systemic situations. I am not innocent enough in the ways of the market to think that it wouldn’t affect behaviour. Of course, it would lead to changes, over time, in the capital structure of investment banking operations. Proper transitional periods would be needed. I suggest that it is worth debating. Maybe there is a fatal flaw. We should certainly search for the flaws. But if we do not find a way of resolving massive and complex trading books, the regulation of the business would probably have to be fiercer than otherwise in order to crush the probability of failure. Resolution is a way of coping with failure. Key voices are the non-bank financial sector and the corporate treasurers who finance the banking system. What would they get out of it? They might benefit from avoiding the risk that the authorities choose to liquidate a LCFI they had thought was too big to fail, with the depletion of value that entails; think of Lehman. They would, in effect, be trading off losses in one part of their portfolio against the prospect of protecting the rest of their investments from the fallout of a credit crunch that would follow the disorderly demise of a distressed LCFI. The cross-border dimension The other big issue is how to handle the resolution of internationally active banks. This is a challenge even for fairly vanilla commercial banking groups. There has been a Basel Concordat on how home and host authorities should co-operate in supervising international banks since 1975. It was updated in 1983 and 1992 to take account of group-level consolidated supervision following the failures of Banco Ambrosiano and then BCCI. But was the Concordat based on a false premiss: that the division of supervisory-labour during peacetime can carry smoothly over to the only period that really matters, distress? Because, as it happens, neither standard resolution regimes for commercial banks nor any super-SRR of the kind I have just outlined for going-concern restructurings could be applied easily to the cross-border activities of LCFIs. SRR tools cannot automatically be applied extraterritorially. It seems to me that policymakers need to face up to, and decide whether or not to fix, the really big issues about how insolvency and resolution laws are applied to internationally active financial companies. BIS Review 33/2010 3 
Broadly speaking, countries’ laws apply either territorial principles to international insolvencies, consistent with separate procedures for each of a bank’s entities in different jurisdictions (so-called “separate-entity resolution”); or universal principles, consistent with a single procedure applying to the resolution of an international bank and its branches abroad, wherever they are located (“single-entity resolution”). I believe that top-level policymakers have to choose what kind of regime they want. This issue needs to be elevated above the level of middle-ranking technocrats where, through no great fault of their own, it has wallowed for too long. The issues were articulated as long as 20 years ago, following BCCI’s failure.2 Nothing much has been done globally. So in the second half of my remarks today, I just want to sketch why this problem arises. (i) Territoriality Territorial approaches to resolution are adopted due to potential conflicts of interest between home and host-state authorities. These may reflect, for example, host countries not wanting to rely on home countries to act in the interests of financial stability in the host country; or different or conflicting triggers and objectives for Special Resolution Regime powers. There are a number of problems with territoriality. It undermines coordinated and cooperative resolutions, and creates uncertainty by encouraging a race for assets and collateral across jurisdictions. Related to that, it reduces the effectiveness of Special Resolution Regimes by allowing host authorities to ring-fence local assets for the benefit of local creditors. And, it can even render resolution infeasible if the legal structure of an LCFI differs substantially from its operational structure, with local legal entities dependent on other parts of the group for vital services. Greater harmonisation of SRRs across the major jurisdictions might help to reduce distrust in other countries’ approaches. But harmonisation does not remove the potential conflict of interests between home and host authorities. The current debate around subsidiarisation of global commercial banking groups stems in large part from these problems. The thought is that if policymakers cannot solve the territorial problem, then they should embrace it – banking would go local, with a degree of ring fencing. That course may conceivably have wider advantages – for example, in the area of macroprudential regulation3 it might give authorities a greater degree of influence over domestic credit conditions. But we do also need to consider whether there might be costs to such an approach. For those policy issues to reach closure, we need to know the way forward on resolution. (ii) Pure universalism What of the other end of the spectrum? In principle, an alternative approach would be to shift to a more universal approach. A pure form of universalism would rule out separate resolution or insolvency proceedings, ring-fencing and, therefore, a race for assets. It might encourage                                                  2  Basel committee on Banking Supervision (1992). “The insolvency liquidation of a multinational bank”, Bank for International Settlements. Its key conclusions were: (1) when closing a multinational bank, supervisors should pay attention to the nature and timing of communications among themselves and of their communications with creditors, shareholders and management; (2) the nature of liquidation rules may be relevant to the manner in which multinational banks are supervised; (3) differences in liquidation rules across jurisdictions in a winding-up can affect returns to depositors and other creditors and the operations of deposit protection schemes; and (4) coordination and cooperation between liquidators can affect the returns to creditors in a liquidation and can be affected by the role of supervisors in a liquidation. 3  See the Bank’s recently published paper: “The role of macroprudential policy: A discussion paper” and Tucker P M W (2009e), “The debate on financial system resilience: Macroprudential instruments” at the Barclays Annual Lecture in London. 4 BIS Review 33/2010 
a more cooperative approach to cross-border resolution. There would be one, global resolution, led by the home authority. But pure universalism also faces major obstacles. First, it would imply a surrender of national sovereignty – replacing it with pre-defined and enforceable rules that determined the roles of different authorities in different jurisdictions. Second, unless steps were taken to rule out the need for sovereign Capital of Last Resort operations4, it might well need to be accompanied by an ex ante burden-sharing mechanism, to facilitate a sharing of the costs of resolution across the jurisdictions in which a bank had activities. In theory, that could be addressed by the main home and host authorities of each LCFI agreeing a set of binding principles to govern the distribution of the costs of a universal resolution across jurisdictions. An alternative would be to design a single resolution regime for all LCFIs, to be implemented along universal lines by a supranational resolution authority. But would countries be prepared to tolerate the loss of fiscal independence and the overturning of national insolvency laws that this model would entail, especially if it required governments to commit to recompense the agency for unlimited amounts in the future? That is most definitely not a question for central bankers. (iii) Modified universalism Pure territoriality and pure universalism are corner solutions. We live in a world where some countries are closer to one corner, others closer to the other. Some have suggested that an intermediate solution might be feasible. This would involve “territorial” countries deciding to resolve financial institutions headquartered in their own jurisdictions on a universal basis. (A possible example of this approach in the recent crisis was the FDIC’s resolution of United Commercial Bank, which involved a “purchase and assumption”5 that extended to the Chinese subsidiary and the Hong Kong branch following coordination amongst the authorities in the US, China and Hong Kong.) A “modified” form of universalism would involve host authorities choosing to defer to and cooperate with a resolution brought by the home country authorities, provided that certain conditions held. Separate insolvency proceedings might be employed by host countries, but allowing the proceeds to be remitted to the home country, “lead” resolution. Variations might be needed for subsidiaries and branches. Subsidiaries are distinct legal entities, but they too can have worldwide creditors and claims. So it would all need to be within some kind of joined-up whole. At a high level, the preconditions for something like this might include: (1) equitable treatment of all creditors regardless of their jurisdiction, because if creditors in host countries were likely to be penalised in a resolution brought by the home country authorities, host authorities would have a strong incentive to ring-fence; (2) broad harmonisation of resolution regimes across the major jurisdictions. Also, if governments do continue to contemplate the possibility of fiscal support in a crisis, then there might need to be some kind of agreement – conceivably case by case – on                                                  4  For a discussion of capital of last resort see, See Tucker P M W (2009f) “The Crisis Management Menu”, SUERF, CEPS and Belgian Financial Forum Conference: Crisis Management at the Cross-Roads, pp. 13 and Tucker P M W (2009b), “The repertoire of official sector interventions in the financial system: last resort lending, market-making, and capital”, Bank of Japan’s 2009 International Conference, Tokyo, May 2009, pp. 17. 5  A “purchase and assumption” is the term used by FDIC to describe when a healthy institution purchases some or all of the assets of a failed deposit taker.

6 BIS Review 33/2010                                                 principles governing the contributions imposed on each country to meeting the costs of the resolution. But the ideas I aired in the first part of the remarks were aimed at helping to take that off the table. A principle of equitable treatment of worldwide creditors and depositors would be consistent with the imposition of losses on unsecured creditors or uninsured depositors, either in a going-concern restructuring of the kind I outlined earlier or through the application of more standard SRR tools to gone-concern bad banks. But it would require losses to be imposed on an equitable basis, respecting the existing priority ranking regardless of the jurisdictional-location of creditors. That might require recognition across the main jurisdictions of certain safeguards.6 And, such an approach would require binding agreements amongst home and host resolution authorities. Vague assurances would not do the trick, as domestic authorities could change their minds when it really mattered. Host and home authorities would need “skin in the game” to underpin co-operation. And co-operation in distressed circumstances could helpfully flow back to how supervisors work together in peacetime. An obstacle to such an approach might be that in some countries, legislation mandates preferential treatment of creditors and depositors of local entities of cross-border banks. But that might be weighed by legislatures against the current reality that when the fiscal authority finds itself injecting equity to save a bank and preserve stability, it protects worldwide creditors not just its home creditors. To be clear, I am not advocating any particular approach here. I just want the authorities to articulate the issues clearly, so that our leaders can make a choice and think through the consequences of that choice. I’m not sure that it has really been put to them up to now. And, of course, whatever is done, within Europe we would need to find an EU version that sat between national and global regimes. Summary My purpose today is not to advocate solutions. It is to identify the big issues and to float some possible avenues for discussion in the EU and internationally. The big question is clear enough. Can we resolve distressed LCFIs in an orderly way without injecting public money? One possible way to cut through Too-Big-To-Fail is to adjust our sense of what “Fail” involves. Perhaps it does not have to involve liquidation or administration. Perhaps it does not have to involve a binary shift from “going concern” to “gone concern”. But it does have to involve loss for equity holders and uninsured creditors. It does have to rekindle market discipline. It does have to preserve the flow of financial services. Those are, surely, the essential components of the resolution leg of the regulation, structure, resolution triangle that make up the reform debate. Individual countries or economic areas such as the EU can get only so far on their own. To cope with distress in global banking, we need to decide whether or not we want international collaboration in the resolution of cross-border banking groups. That is a question which, one way or another, the highest reaches of the authorities should answer as part of the reform debate. Once that is clear, some of the questions about structure and regulation might become clearer. A lot rests on whether we can resolve distressed LCFIs. We need to answer the big questions.   6  Examples of such safeguards include: creditors left no worse of than in liquidation; netting and set-off agreements respected; secured creditor claims and collateral kept together; and capital market arrangements, such as covered bond programmes and securitisations, protected. 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with Le Point Interview by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, with Le Point, Frankfurt am Main, conducted by Messrs Romain Gubert and Patrick Bonazza on 15 March 2010 and published on 17 March 2010. *      *      * Le Point: The countries of the euro area have just come to an agreement on helping Greece and saving it from attacks by speculators. Does this not reward bad behaviour and betray the principles of the Maastricht Treaty? Jean-Claude Trichet: The countries of the euro area have just echoed the commitment made by the Heads of State or Government with regard to taking determined and coordinated action, should it prove necessary, to safeguard the stability of the euro area. One thing I see from the Greek crisis – and this is of fundamental importance – is that nobody is now questioning the principles of the Stability and Growth Pact. On the contrary, those principles have been robustly reaffirmed. The Greek government has just adopted a series of very significant, necessary, convincing and bold measures. It has clearly indicated its objective of complying with the fundamental principles of the Stability and Growth Pact within a reasonable period of time. This is important. Remember that in 2003 and 2004, a period that was less turbulent than the current situation, the Pact was strongly criticised – in particular by the previous French President and the former German Chancellor – and the ECB stepped in with a robust defence of the Pact in order to prevent it from being rendered meaningless. Now, nobody questions it. The people who vehemently criticised the Pact in the past have now realised the extent of the need to respect it – both for the cohesion of the euro area as a whole and in order to preserve and strengthen the confidence of households, firms and investors, thereby fostering growth and job creation. Le Point: You’re an optimist. The Greeks are demonstrating their dissatisfaction. They don’t really seem ready to tighten their belts … Jean-Claude Trichet: Surveys – including those conducted very recently – show that the people of Greece understand well the need to put their public finances in order and adopt the measures necessary in order to return to growth and job creation. Like everyone else who shares the single currency, the Greek economy has – from the moment it joined the euro area – enjoyed a number of significant advantages in monetary terms. Being part of the euro area has strengthened the Greek economy. Thanks to the euro, it was no longer subject to exchange rate risk, it has access to an integrated economy comprising 330 million European citizens, and it has benefited from having a currency which inspires confidence and has therefore afforded Greece low medium and long-term market interest rates. Its external current account deficit has been financed by the very fact of belonging to the euro area. Of course, in exchange for these significant advantages, the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact must be fully respected. Le Point: All the same, we have just found out that Greece cheated. It hid shameful secrets about its financial situation from its partners. How can we stop this happening again? Jean-Claude Trichet: This situation is totally unacceptable. And it’s a major problem because all of the countries in the euro area are suffering as a result of this misconduct. To ensure the good governance of our currency, the credibility of the budgetary information provided by the euro area countries must be absolutely above reproach. We fully support the European Commission: Eurostat, the European statistical office, must have extremely broad powers at its disposal. It must be able to check the information supplied by Greece in the country and on the basis of actual evidence with all of the necessary powers of investigation. Such a situation must not recur, either in Greece or in any other country. BIS Review 32/2010 1 
Le Point: There are two scenarios in the coming weeks. The positive scenario: Greece is saved. In the second, Spain is the next weak link … Jean-Claude Trichet: At this stage, I have no reason to doubt the solidity of the other euro area countries, as long as they implement their respective stability programmes rigorously. Each country is determined to stabilise the situation as far as its public finances are concerned. I am keen to stress that the consolidated situation of the euro area as a whole, as far as its budget deficit is concerned, is not the worst among the industrialised countries. For example, the consolidated public deficit of the euro area amounts to 7% of GDP, while those of the United States and Japan amount to more than 10%. All of us, without exception, have very serious problems. Le Point: Many people are criticising you, despite the crisis, for not having agreed to be more flexible – in short, for not having allowed the euro area countries to take on more debt in order to stimulate their economies. Do these critics have a case? Jean-Claude Trichet: Frankly, I don’t know how anyone could want our current budgetary situation to be any worse! Do we really want to be responsible for burdening our children and grandchildren with our debts? I believe that, in the face of the worst crisis since the Second World War, central banks, and the ECB in particular, have acted quickly, clearly and boldly. Governments in Europe and throughout the world have taken the necessary decisions in real time. In my opinion, they have done their job well. Weighing down their budgets even further would not have been at all sensible. Le Point: You are, conversely, also being criticised for having provided liquidity support to the banks. And for having prompted the creation of speculative bubbles ... Jean-Claude Trichet: That is not the case. We have adopted a host of bold – or “non-standard” – measures since the summer of 2007 in order to provide European banks with the necessary liquidity. This was essential in order to allow banks to continue financing the real economy in spite of the crisis. That said, the markets are now slowly recovering, and, as they gradually return to normal, we are progressively unwinding the exceptional measures that were introduced in order to refinance the banks. Le Point: Given their sheer size, would the return of inflation be the only way for governments to eliminate their debts? Jean-Claude Trichet: Throughout this crisis, since the summer of 2007, the European Central Bank and all the central banks of the euro area, the Banque de France among them, have always acted with a view to restoring confidence. Do you really believe that by suggesting we give inflation a looser rein we would have restored that confidence? Households’ confidence? Firms’ and investors’ confidence? If I were to say to you today – obviously an absurd hypothesis – that I’m not against a rate of inflation of around 4%, you would see, in real time, every single market participant drastically raising market interest rates to price in future inflation. What’s more, a sizeable risk premium to cover possible further changes would be added. Households would lose confidence. Financing would be much costlier for firms. And governments would see the cost of servicing their debt soar. Inflation – which, incidentally, our fellow citizens have said a firm “no” to – is most definitely not the solution! Le Point: Since the onset of the crisis, politicians have been saying they will carry out a thorough review of the financial system. But they’ve only tackled tax havens and traders’ bonuses. Not much of a review, is it? Jean-Claude Trichet: There is a global consensus among industrialised countries and emerging economies, first, that the principles of the market economy remain the best way of creating wealth, second, that the global system has to be a lot less fragile and much more robust and resilient and, third, that the best methodology consists in working together in the G20, the Financial Stability Board and, in particular, the Basel Committee. We have an obligation to achieve results. Our democracies would not forgive us if, in the future, we had 2 BIS Review 32/2010 
BIS Review 32/2010 3 another crisis as deep as the one we experienced in 2008 and 2009. We’re not looking for scapegoats. We have to strengthen, systematically and methodically, the frailties of the global financial system. Those who say that once the storm has passed, we should return to “business as usual” are grossly mistaken. That’s not the way we will achieve growth and create the jobs that are so necessary. Le Point: Would you, for example, be in favour of the creation of a European rating agency? Jean-Claude Trichet: It is true that rating agencies have a great deal of influence. It is not ideal to have a global oligopoly of just three agencies. That said, artificial creations must always be avoided. We are closely monitoring this issue. Le Point: And the creation of a European monetary fund (EMF)? Jean-Claude Trichet: The Governing Council of the ECB has not yet taken a position on this issue. I will only say that, if my understanding is correct, this would be a possible source of financing, subject to extremely strict conditions and without constituting any form of subsidy, that would aim to prevent phenomena that could cause financial instability in a euro area country. It would not be a monetary entity, so that adjective does not seem appropriate to me. In any case, I believe that the activity of such a fund, if created, should be strictly controlled and confined to cases of an extremely serious and specific threat. But I would repeat that the Governing Council of the ECB has not yet taken a position on this issue. Le Point: Could a scenario be envisaged in which a country is no longer able to meet its obligations and leaves the euro area? Jean-Claude Trichet: I have always said that I will not comment on absurd hypotheses. Joining the euro area is a major decision. It is not a membership that can be adapted to suit the circumstances. It is about sharing a common destiny with other countries. All the current members have joined the euro area not only on the basis of the Maastricht criteria, in accordance with the Treaty, but also on the basis of a broad consensus across the major strands of the political spectrum of each country. This seems to me to be essential, precisely because it involves sharing a common destiny. 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: The Corporate Governance Code of the Kingdom of Bahrain Welcome address by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the launch of the proposed new Corporate Governance Code, Manama, 16 March 2010. *      *      * Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:  It gives me great pleasure to be with you here today and to take part in the launch of the proposed new Corporate Governance Code for all public companies in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Although this initiative has been led by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Central Bank has been involved at all stages in the development of the new Code and we are strong supporters of it. We will be working with the financial sector and listed companies on the implementation of both the spirit and letter of the new Code. Although high standards of corporate governance are essential for all publicly listed companies, they are especially important for firms in the financial sector. If I may refer back to the speech that I gave at the World Islamic Banking Conference in December of last year, financial institutions – and banks in particular – are not like other corporations where directors need to consider only the interests of shareholders. Financial institutions have a special position of trust in that they are charged with looking after other people’s money. This means that the interests of creditors, depositors, policy holders, and clients need to have equal weight with those of shareholders and the decisions taken by the Board of Directors. Recognition of the directors’ fiduciary responsibilities is, therefore, an essential element of corporate governance for banks and other financial institutions. Unfortunately, the global financial crisis has provided many illustrations of failures of corporate governance. There is common pattern behind many of the failed financial institutions of the last 18 months. In many cases, the Chief Executive was a dominant figure who made sure that he alone took all important decisions. There was no culture of open debate and discussion within the senior management of these institutions, with the result that other members of the Board of Directors did not feel able to challenge the Chief Executive’s decisions. Many bank Boards lacked banking experts. Individuals were recruited to the Board of banks for their connections rather than for their knowledge of the banking industry and their ability to ask the right questions. In the case of many failed banks the standards of corporate governance fell far short of what should have been expected. It was the Board of Directors that should have challenged the aggressive growth strategies pursued by some Chief Executives. It was the Board of Directors that should have ensured there were proper risk management and control systems within each bank. It was the Board of Directors that should have ensured that the senior management of the bank had properly taken into account the possibility of experiencing extreme stress scenarios. Finally, it was the Board of Directors that should have ensured the remuneration structures were in line with the long-run interest of the bank itself rather than rewarding short-term risk-taking. The need for high standards of corporate governance is, therefore, one of the main lessons to be drawn from the global financial crisis. It is in this context that the CBB views the new Code as a significant development in strengthening Bahrain’s reputation as a well regulated financial centre. The new Code builds on current international best practice for corporate governance. For example, it reflects the corporate governance principles developed by the Organisation for BIS Review 32/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 32/2010 Economic Cooperation and Development which have become the benchmark for international standards in the field. Of course, the special responsibilities of the Board of Directors of a financial institution which I mentioned earlier means that the CBB will need to continue to apply its own corporate governance requirements on such matters as internal high level controls, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, and various public disclosure and reporting requirements. These will need to remain more detailed than those in the new Code, for example setting the public disclosure requirements for financial institutions. The CBB’s detailed requirements on corporate governance will therefore continue to exist in parallel to the new Code. It is important that public companies in Bahrain, both financial and non-financial, enter fully into the spirit of the new Code. It should not be seen as a matter of complying with just another set of regulations, but as something that should influence the corporate culture of companies in Bahrain. Greater transparency and more effective governance structures will in the long-run only serve to increase the attractiveness of Bahrain for foreign investors seeking to establish or expand operations in the MENA region. In conclusion I would like to take this opportunity to thanks Dr. Hassan Fakhro, Minister of Industry and Commerce, for his support and cooperation in the introduction of the new Corporate Governance Code, and to the Steering Committee for the excellent work it has achieved. Thank you for your attention. 
Daniel K Tarullo: Toward an effective resolution regime for large financial institutions Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Symposium on Building the Financial System of the 21st Century, Armonk, New York, 18 March 2010. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * Two years ago this week, Bear Stearns succumbed to severe liquidity stress. It was rescued, and eventually absorbed by JPMorgan Chase, with financing assistance provided by the Federal Reserve. Although it would take another six months before the accumulating stress and uncertainty posed an immediate threat to nearly all of our major financial institutions, it is clear in retrospect that this arranged marriage, and its accompanying dowry of government financing, set off an expansion of the universe of firms perceived as too big to fail. During the financial crisis, government authorities in the United States and elsewhere believed they had only two realistic options in the face of serious distress at a large financial firm. First, they could try to contain systemic risk by stabilizing the firm through capital injections, extraordinary liquidity assistance, a subsidized acquisition by a less vulnerable firm, or some combination of these supports. Second, they could allow the firm to fail and enter generally applicable bankruptcy processes, risking in those times of fear and uncertainty a run on similarly situated firms. The Bear Stearns deal was an example of the first policy option. Lehman Brothers was an example of the second. When its bankruptcy set off a firestorm in the exceedingly dry tinder of financial markets in the fall of 2008, the U.S. government decided that further failures of large, interconnected financial institutions risked bringing down the entire financial system. It responded to the situation with the Troubled Asset Relief Program to provide capital, and the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to extend debt guarantees, to large financial firms. Indeed, faced with the possibility of a cascading financial crisis, most governments around the world selected the bailout option in most cases. But if the costs of this approach are less dramatic during a crisis, they are no less significant afterward. Entrenching too-big-to-fail status obviously risks imposing significant costs on the taxpayer. It undermines market discipline, competitive equality among financial institutions of different sizes, and normal regulatory and supervisory expectations. The desirability of a third alternative to the Hobson’s choice of bailout or disorderly bankruptcy is obvious – hence the prominence during the regulatory reform debate of proposals for a special resolution process that would allow the government to wind down a systemically important firm in an orderly way while still imposing losses on shareholders and creditors. The crisis has also focused attention on the special problems created by the failure of a large, internationally active financial firm. In my remarks I will elaborate on the relationship between resolution regimes and an effective overall system of financial regulation and supervision, both in the international and domestic spheres.1  At the risk of some oversimplification, I would state that relationship as follows: First, an effective domestic resolution process is a necessary complement to supervision that would bring more market discipline into the decisionmaking of large financial firms, their                                                  1  The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors. BIS Review 32/2010 1 
counterparties, and investors. At the same time, even a well-designed resolution mechanism is no substitute for reformed regulatory rules and strengthened supervisory oversight. Second, the high legal and political hurdles to harmonized cross-border resolution processes suggest that, for the foreseeable future, the effectiveness of those processes will largely depend on supervisory requirements and cooperation undertaken before distress appears on the horizon. I would further suggest that the importance of proposed requirements that each large financial firm produce a so-called living will is that this device could better tie the supervisory and resolution processes together. A resolution regime for large, interconnected firms As compelling as the case for such a process is, the debate around resolution proposals has highlighted the challenge of crafting a workable resolution regime for large, interconnected firms. The basic design problem is that such a regime must advance the goals of both financial stability and market discipline. While these goals are usually complementary, they can at times be competing – especially in periods of high financial stress, when time consistency problems can loom large. In the midst of a crisis, governments fearful of financial upheaval can be tempted to provide assistance to supposedly uninsured creditors, even at the cost of increasing moral hazard in the post-crisis period. Despite the consequent design difficulties, I think there are certain essential features of any special resolution process. First, any new regime should be used only in those rare circumstances where a firm’s failure would have serious adverse effects on financial stability. That is, the presumption should be that generally applicable bankruptcy law applies to nonbank financial firms – even large, interconnected ones. One way to help ensure that the regime is invoked only when necessary to protect the public’s interest in systemic stability is to use a “multi-key” approach – that is, one that requires the approval of multiple agencies and a determination by each that the high standards governing the use of the special regime have been met. Second, once invoked, the government should have broad authority to wind down the company in an orderly way. This authority should include – among other things – selling assets, liabilities, or business units of the firm; transferring the systemically significant or viable operations of the firm to a new bridge entity that can continue these operations; and repudiating burdensome contracts of the firm, subject to appropriate conditions and compensation. Third, there should be a clear expectation that the shareholders and creditors of the failing firm will bear losses to the fullest extent consistent with preserving financial stability. Shareholders of the firm ultimately are responsible for the organization’s management (or, more likely, mismanagement) and are supposed to be in a first-loss position upon failure of the firm. Shareholders, therefore, should pay the price for the firm’s failure and should not benefit from a government-managed resolution process. To promote market discipline on the part of the creditors of large, interconnected firms, unsecured creditors of the firms must also bear losses. Here is where the potential conflict of policy goals is obvious. While losses imposed on creditors will increase market discipline in the longer term, the immediate effect could be to provoke a run on other firms with broadly similar positions or business strategies. Thus the extent of these losses and the manner in which they are applied may need to depend on the facts of the individual case. At the very least, however, subordinated debt, or other financial interests that can qualify as regulatory capital, should be fully exposed to losses. Fourth, the ultimate cost of any government assistance provided in the course of the resolution process to prevent severe disruptions to the financial system should be borne by the firm or the financial services industry, not by taxpayers. The scope of financial institutions assessed for these purposes should be appropriately broad, reflecting that a wide range of financial institutions likely would benefit, directly or indirectly, from actions that avoid or 2 BIS Review 32/2010 
mitigate threats to financial stability. However, because the largest and most interconnected firms likely would benefit the most, it seems appropriate that these firms should bear a proportionally larger share of any costs that cannot be recouped from the failing firm itself. To avoid pro-cyclical effects, such assessments should be collected over time. Establishing a resolution regime with these characteristics is, I would suggest, one of the most important financial regulatory reforms for every country that does not already have such a mechanism in place. It would lend substance to the idea that market discipline can be a solid third pillar of financial regulation, along with stronger prudential requirements and improved supervisory oversight. Still, as is implicit in the foregoing discussion, an untested regime will probably not acquire complete credibility until it is actually applied successfully. For this reason, among others, it is important to ensure that other regulatory tools will help compensate for the uncertainties associated with an essentially untested mechanism. International efforts on resolution issues The looming or actual failure of a large, internationally active financial firm inevitably complicates the already challenging process of resolution. Mismatches in the amounts and maturities of assets and liabilities held by the firm in the various countries in which it operates can lead host governments to take special action to protect the interests of depositors and creditors. And different insolvency regimes apply to separately incorporated subsidiaries across the world. Some of those regimes may be substantively inconsistent with one another, or may not account for the special characteristics of a large international firm. A natural response, which one can find peppered through various law journals over the years, is to propose an international treaty that would establish and harmonize appropriate insolvency regimes throughout the world. Just to state the proposition is to see the enormous hurdles to its realization. The task of harmonizing divergent legal regimes, and reconciling the principles underlying many of these regimes, would be challenge enough. But an effective international regime would also likely require agreement on how to share the losses and possible special assistance associated with a global firm’s insolvency. Despite the good and thorough work being undertaken in both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Stability Board, we must acknowledge that satisfyingly clean and comprehensive solutions to the international difficulties occasioned by such insolvencies are not within sight.2 It would certainly be useful if jurisdictions could at least broadly synchronize both standard bankruptcy and any special resolution procedures applicable to a failing financial firm. But even this significant advance would not settle many of the nettlesome problems raised by a cross-border insolvency. It thus seems reasonably clear that effective management of these problems will, at least for the foreseeable future, require regulatory coordination and supervisory cooperation before a large firm’s failure becomes a real possibility. In one sense, this observation reinforces the importance of the international agenda for strengthening capital and liquidity standards. It also counsels continued attention to efforts to ensure that globally active institutions are subject to effective consolidated supervision, and that information-sharing arrangements among home and host country supervisors are well designed and implemented. To this end, the key supervisors and central banks for each of the largest global banks will begin to meet regularly to discuss crisis planning, with particular attention to contingency liquidity planning.                                                  2  See Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group (2009), Report and Recommendations of the Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group (Basel, Switzerland: Basel Committee, September); and Financial Stability Forum (2009), FSF Principles for Cross-Border Cooperation on Crisis Management (Basel, Switzerland: FSF, April). (The Financial Stability Forum subsequently was renamed the Financial Stability Board.) The Basel Committee’s Cross-border Resolution Group released its report and recommendations today, and the FSB will present a final report and recommendations to the G-20 in October. BIS Review 32/2010 3 
The crisis demonstrated that issues around cross-border liquidity support are difficult. Liquidity pressures may arise in unexpected places, time for coordination will be short, and failures in one jurisdiction likely will spread quickly to other jurisdictions. The Basel Committee and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors are each working on definitions of liquid assets, common stress-testing metrics, and structural balance sheet measures. We are actively discussing the appropriate division of responsibility between home and host authorities to provide liquidity support and the related issue of how to approach cross-border branch operations. Some have called into question the traditional assumption that home country authorities will be willing and able to support all of the worldwide operations of a banking group headquartered in its jurisdiction. It is not clear what approach might work better, but there is an obvious need for broad international consistency and careful calibration with other prudential requirements. One of the key issues identified by the Basel Committee’s Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group is the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest organizations. Often the complexity is motivated by tax or regulatory factors, rather than a clear business purpose. Given the way these firms are structured and their linkages to key systems and other institutions, resolution of such an organization will carry significant risk of spillovers to other key markets, payments systems, or systemically important institutions. The Cross-Border Bank Resolution Group consequently recommended developing initiatives that would result in simpler, less interconnected organizational structures. Living wills This point leads us to one much-discussed idea, that of firm-specific resolution plans – sometimes referred to more colorfully, though not wholly accurately, as living wills. This proposal provides a good opportunity to advance the aim of linking resolution mechanisms to other regulatory tools, both domestically and internationally. In one variant of the idea, each internationally active bank would be required to develop, and potentially to execute, its own resolution plan – literally, to plan for its own demise. Such a requirement could doubtless be helpful to some degree, but it has notable limitations. Most obviously, it is very difficult to predict in advance of a crisis which parts of the firm will be under greatest stress, what geographical regions may be affected most severely, and what the condition in various markets and economies will be, as well as the stability of counterparties and similarly situated institutions. Furthermore, governments may be understandably reluctant to rely too much upon a wind-down plan developed by an internationally active financial firm that so mismanaged itself that it is on the brink of failure, placing other institutions at peril. Finally, management of an institution can be expected to seek to preserve as much value for shareholders as possible in its planning, whereas the supervisors’ objective in a crisis is to achieve an orderly resolution, which will often entail winding down or restructuring the insolvent firm in ways that effectively wipe out shareholder interests. The living will requirement could be broadened so as to make it into a potentially very useful supervisory tool for healthy firms, as well as a resource in the event that resolution became necessary. Under this approach, the firm would, in addition to developing a resolution plan, be required to draw up a contingency plan to rescue itself short of failure, identify obstacles to an orderly resolution, and show it can quickly produce the information needed for the supervisor to orchestrate an orderly resolution should the need arise. These plans will need to evolve as the organization’s business and economic conditions evolve, and accordingly, the plans will need to become a regular part of normal supervisory processes. A living will of this type could remove some of the uncertainty around a possible resolution. It would force firms and their supervisors to review contingency plans regularly. As part of their ongoing oversight, supervisors could target the areas where a firm’s planning falls short of best practices. Focusing on the legal, contractual, and business relationships among the 4 BIS Review 32/2010 
BIS Review 32/2010 5 firm’s subsidiaries could yield significant benefits for prudential supervision in normal, as well as stressed, times. The various elements of the regulatory system could thus be better integrated by identifying mechanisms and connections for the transmission of risk and liability between affiliates and by identifying relationships that may present an obstacle to the ready sales of businesses, the proceeds from which might allow the firm to avoid failure. Central to the success of a living will as a supervisory tool is the quality of information it would make available in a crisis. Some of the information would be relatively static. A firm would have to inventory all of its legal entities, along with the legal regimes applicable to each one, and map its business lines into legal entities. A firm also would have to document interaffiliate guarantees, funding, hedging, and provision of information technology and other key services. This information would be needed to deal with any crisis, no matter what its specific form. Once the centrality of accurate, comprehensive information is understood, it becomes apparent that a very significant upgrade of management information systems (MIS) may be the only way for the firm to satisfy living will requirements, just as we at the Federal Reserve found when we led the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program – popularly known as the bank stress tests – that improved MIS are needed for ongoing risk management at the institution. Supervisory demands for improved MIS could have another benefit. Just as a homeowner has an incentive to shed belongings to reduce the expense of moving, so a financial firm may have a powerful incentive to simplify its organizational structure and rationalize relationships among its corporate entities to reduce the cost of developing comprehensive MIS that enable an organization to retrieve information in multiple formats across jurisdictions, business lines, and legal entities. Simpler structures can also be encouraged by reemphasizing existing supervisory guidance requiring banking organizations to measure and manage their risks not only on the global, consolidated level, but also on a legal entity basis. Together, the information requirements of living wills and the need to measure and manage risks at the legal entity level can help create the right incentives for firms to simplify their structures without necessarily requiring a supervisor to delve into the details of a banking group’s structure. Conclusion All of this work on resolution, both domestic and international, is important and necessary. But we must be realistic about what it can accomplish. In light of what has happened over the past two years, it is imperative that governments convince markets that they can and will put large financial firms into a resolution process rather than bail out creditors and shareholders. Yet no one can guarantee that future resolutions of systemically important firms will proceed smoothly or predictably. Resolution mechanisms must be understood not as silver bullets, but as critical pieces of a broader agenda directed at systemic risk and the too-big-to-fail problem. 
Mario Draghi: Modernisation of the global financial architecture – global financial stability Remarks by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, Brussels, 17 March 2010. *      *      * Thank you very much for having invited me to take part in this important debate between European and national parliaments. International and regional cooperation and national political leadership are essential complements for achieving global financial reforms; and the debate in this Committee is really helpful for that purpose. It is ultimately national and regional legislatures, accountable to their voters, that must decide and implement reforms.  The strains in the global financial system have eased considerably in the last twelve months: the banks are once again raising funds, asset write-downs have diminished. Nevertheless, elements of fragility are still present in various parts of the financial system and risks, mainly related to the deterioration of traditional loan books, the bunching of refinancing needs in the next few years, and to new sources of risk such as sovereign risk. It is essential that we can count, in the years to come, on a fully restored ability of the banking sector to perform its essential tasks in the economy.  We have come a long way towards strengthening the financial system since this crisis began. But we have hard work ahead of us to finish up. In my remarks, I will focus mainly on these forward challenges. But let me start by taking stock of where we have gotten to. Three things have been important in getting us to where we are now:  First, the recognition that, in a closely integrated system, we all sit in the same boat;  Second, the leadership of the G20 process, in which the EU has played an important role, in agreeing objectives and timelines for substantial reform; and  Third, the establishment of mechanisms, such as the FSB, to hasten and coordinate the policy development needed to meet these objectives. When I say we have gotten far, I am speaking to an unprecedented amount of international dialogue and co-operation on important financial system issues, and the resulting substantive changes that either have or are about to come into place. While many issues remain to be resolved, in Europe, in the US and elsewhere, we are, collectively, fundamentally reshaping the framework for systemic financial oversight:  First, top-down, system-wide oversight arrangements are being put in place at the national, regional and international level. These include more encompassing surveillance, with broadened macro-prudential perspectives, as well as mechanisms for triggering action on identified risks. Examples are the European Systemic Risk Board and related arrangements, the US Financial Services Oversight Council, the IMF-FSB Early Warning Exercise, and the establishment of the FSB itself.   Second, as part of this, major jurisdictions and regions are overhauling their regulatory and supervisory structures to strengthen responsiveness to systemic risks, improve coordination and close gaps. The FSB is in many ways the international manifestation of these efforts;   Third, the regulatory perimeter is being expanded. Major jurisdictions are finalizing legislation that for the first time establishes formal oversight over the OTC derivatives markets and its major dealers, hedge funds and credit rating agencies. In BIS Review 31/2010 1 
 Fourth, we have put in place cross-border oversight and crisis management contingency planning for the largest and most complex global financial institutions, each of which now have functioning core supervisory colleges and crisis management groups.  At the level of the essential regulatory policies to buttress financial stability, let me recall:  That we are in the process of calibrating a fundamentally revised global bank capital framework which will establish stronger protection through improved risk coverage, more and higher quality capital, a counter-cyclical buffer and a constraint on the build-up of banking sector leverage;  Second, we have developed and will implement a global liquidity standard for banks that will promote higher liquidity buffers and constrain the maturity mismatching that created the condition for this crisis;  Third, we are making progress in developing a policy framework and tools to roll back the moral hazard risks posed by institutions that are systemically important;  Fourth, we have eliminated the perverse incentives that pervaded securitization, including the scope for leverage to develop in opaque off-balance sheet vehicles through changes to accounting standards and regulatory and prudential rules;  Fifth, we have developed a series of supervisory tools to raise standards of governance, risk management and capital conservation at core financial institutions. In this context, let me note that:  – we are making strong progress towards a forward looking expected loss provisioning regime for credit losses which will dampen procyclicality and align accounting and prudential objectives in this key area; and – we are making good headway towards establishing compensation regimes that are better aligned with risks taken in significant financial institutions.  I have been selective in my enumeration. But the point I want to make is that we should not underestimate what has been accomplished. Each of the above areas are difficult in their own right. That we have been able to progress global policy development and in cases implementation on such a broad front, while fighting a very serious financial crisis, is something that has never happened before.  So, the direction in which we are moving internationally is encouraging. But as we hit the homestretch in the above areas, your political leadership will determine whether we accomplish credible and robust global reforms that deliver the protections that our citizens rightly demand, yet preserve the enormous advantages of an internationally integrated financial system. We must not only reaffirm our commitment to global solutions, but demonstrate our willingness to reach agreement on the issues that stand in their way. We cannot all have it our own way.  In the process, we must guard against pressures to water down the stringency of global reforms. That such pressures originate within a financial industry concerned to preserve competitive advantages is not a surprise. But such pressures are also evident in hesitation by some countries about the impact of reforms on their own financial institutions. This hesitation is stronger where the starting point is weaker. However, it would be a very serious and unfortunate mistake to allow these different starting points to result in weaker standards than we need for the future. Given the economic and social costs of this crisis, we simply cannot afford sub-standard outcomes. And were we to fail, the risks is that countries and regions will go their own way 2 BIS Review 31/2010 
and that the system will fragment, with very significant global costs. Hence, we must keep our focus on achieving global standards that are credible, and as part of this, agree transition and phase-in arrangements that enable all of us to move there. I will come back to this point.  Let me speak to the key areas where we need to make headway in the months ahead.  First and foremost, we must complete the revamp of the Basel capital framework and the liquidity standard, along with the complementary changes, including provisioning, that address the problems of procyclicality that we have seen in this crisis. We made a major step forward on this issue in December, when the Basel Committee released – on schedule – the full package of reform proposals. Comprehensive impact assessments are now underway to assess the consequences of the December capital and liquidity proposals on the banking sector. This is complemented by a top down assessment to calibrate the new minimum requirements, taking account of, among other things, loss experience over this crisis, and the impact on banks’ role in the financial system and the benefits and costs of the new requirements in the steady state.  As I mentioned earlier, it will be critical that we do not let current strained conditions shape the standards, but instead keep our focus on the rigorous framework needed to ensure balanced, sustainable banking in the years ahead. While the banking sector has already made significant progress to raise the level and quality of its capital and liquidity, immediately implementing in full the more stringent minimum requirements could have negative effects. We will design appropriate transition and grandfathering arrangements that rule this out. We have set in train jointly with the Basel Committee, and with the IMF as a key partner, a thorough macroeconomic impact assessment to inform these phase-in and implementation arrangements. Preliminary results on all assessment streams will be available in June/July. Calibration work will continue into the fall, and the broad features of the framework, along with the transition arrangements, will be ready by the G20 Summit in November. Countries will need to pass any necessary legislation to implement the reform according to the agreed timetable, and the EU is at the forefront of this.  Second, this year we must agree on measures to credibly reduce the moral hazard and systemic risk caused by firms that are “too big to fail”. TBTF is first and foremost a national problem – at worst when institutions are too big to save. But we are all affected by the moral hazard consequences of the problem going unresolved. There is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution here. One focus of our work is therefore to provide supervisors with tools that enable them to take action in national contexts under existing authority – governance, intensity of supervision, structural simplification, capital surcharges, etc. Systemically important financial institutions have to be resilient even in periods of broad financial system stress events. Capital, liquidity and leverage expectations should reflect that. But we will never be able to fully eliminate the potential for failures, therefore a key requirement across all jurisdictions is the establishment of effective resolution frameworks that allow all types and size of institutions to fail, and adequate co-ordination of these frameworks across borders. This is a tall order, as we all know. However, should effective cross-border resolution prove out of reach, it will strengthen the case for alternative solutions: to place restrictions on activities/size/structure that make all institutions resolvable, or to raise capital and other requirements on systemic institutions to a point where the likelihood and impact of default is reduced to a very low level. This will come at a cost to intermediation and global financial integration. Given the diversity of institutions and financial systems involved, a key challenge will be to avoid inconsistencies in what results. We must achieve consistent design and implementation of new measures to ensure a level playing field and to address potential concerns about market fragmentation. Our aim is to reduce systemic risks globally by having standards for TBTF firms that set a common floor, and actions across countries that are sufficiently coordinated to avoid regulatory arbitrage. We will provide an interim report on BIS Review 31/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 31/2010 these issues to the G20 Summit in June, and final recommendations to the November Summit.  Third, we must finalise reforms to regulate, make transparent and centrally clear a substantial portion of the OTC derivatives markets, and so reduce their scope to act as channels of contagion. Legislation is advancing in the US and EU to establish the requisite frameworks for this. Among critical questions to resolve are:  which derivatives products can and should be standardised, and ought to be subject to a mandatory central clearing requirement;  whether, and if so how to define which type of, commercial end-users should be exempted from these requirements. We must be careful to avoid inconsistencies here, because this will drive regulatory arbitrage in this global market. To accomplish meaningful systemic risk reduction, we need robust globally agreed standards of soundness for all central counterparties. And governments should ensure that the determination of which derivatives should subject be to central clearing is not left to central counterparties alone. We also need harmonised definitions of standardised derivatives, and are setting in train work across the US and EU to this effect. It is also imperative that regulators have the information available to them to police the market for potential manipulative abuses. This is why there must be mandatory trade reporting of all OTC derivatives transactions, regardless of whether they are centrally cleared or bilaterally negotiated.  Fourth, we must firmly embed reforms to compensation practices at financial institutions. As you know, the FSB set out Principles and Implementation Standards for Sound Compensation arrangements last year. In December, we launched a detailed assessment of implementation of these standards. This is a very important task not just because this is the FSB’s first peer review, but also because of the importance and political dimension of this topic. We are on schedule to conclude this review later this month. The review points to a key message – that a lot has been done by national authorities and that change is taking place in the major firms. However, differences remain in the approach to and pace of implementation. Greater progress has been achieved in the areas of governance, supervisory oversight and disclosure of compensation, while much more work needs to be done on pay structures and risk-alignment. We will be setting out additional recommendations in this area later in March. Concluding remarks At the outset, I noted that international cooperation and national/regional political leadership are complementary drivers for achieving global financial reform. Together, we have come a long way. But 2010 will be a critical year as we press ahead with global financial reforms. To maintain the momentum, we are critically dependent on your support. Indeed, internationally coordinated reforms cannot be agreed nor implemented without the support of national political leaders and those who are in a position to make final decisions. Your decisions, and those or your colleagues in other jurisdictions, will determine whether we are able to build a more robust and consistent global financial order necessary to preserve the advantages of an integrated financial system. Beyond the policy development work, full and consistent implementation will take time and perseverance. As I said, we must keep our eyes on the end objective, and we will develop transition paths to take us there. As we work to improve international cooperation and to further financial reforms, I hope we can count on the political support and leadership of all of you in this room. Thank you very much. 
BIS Review 90/2010 1 Kevin Warsh: It’s Greek to me – economic events of the last three years Speech by Mr Kevin Warsh, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Rotary Club of Atlanta Meeting, Atlanta, Georgia, 28 June 2010. *      *      * The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. Nellie Liang, Daniel Covitz, William English, and Brian Madigan of the Board’s staff contributed to these remarks. It is tempting to view the economic events of the last three years as a series of unrelated, unpredictable, unfortunate financial shocks. And it is easy – too easy, really – to bemoan the latest flare-up of crisis conditions, and chalk it up to the global economy’s continued string of bad luck. If what ails us is nothing more than a case of bad fortune, then the mixed metaphor of the moment has it about right: the black swans are caught up in the perfect storm. And if what is needed to induce a durable global economic expansion amounts to more doses of the now-familiar spending packages and weekend shock therapies, then we would know that our luck was indeed changing. If only it were so.  In my view, a strong, sustainable U.S. economic expansion is not in the hands of the fates. It rests in our hands – the hands of fiscal, regulatory, trade, and monetary policymakers. Equally, it rests with business leaders like you here at the Atlanta Rotary Club.  We will soon give notice to the third anniversary since the onset of the global financial crisis. As we mark this occasion – and continue to witness shocks arising intermittently and unevenly – it might be worth debunking some popular views that have become part of the crisis narrative. In their stead, I will begin with what I believe are some truths, perhaps hiding in plain sight all along.  Subprime mortgages were not at the core of the global crisis; they were only indicative of the dramatic mispricing of virtually every asset everywhere in the world. The crisis was not made in the USA, but first manifested itself here. The volatility in financial markets is not the source of the problem, but a critical signpost. Too-big-to-fail exacerbated the global financial crisis, and remains its troubling legacy. Excessive growth in government spending is not the economy’s salvation, but a principal foe. Slowing the creep of protectionism is no small accomplishment, but it is not the equal of meaningful expansion of trade and investment opportunities to enhance global growth. The European sovereign debt crisis is not upsetting the stability in financial markets; it is demonstrating how far we remain from a sustainable equilibrium. Turning private-sector liabilities into public-sector obligations may effectively buy time, but it alone buys neither stability nor prosperity over the horizon.  In the balance of my remarks, I will survey recent economic and financial market developments. Next, with the benefit and burden of recent U.S. experience, I will offer some changes for the next edition of policymakers’ Crisis Response Guide. Finally, even amid greater uncertainty about economic prospects, I will seek to further the discussion about a path for policy.  Economic and Financial Market Developments Recent economic data support a moderate recovery in economic activity. As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted last week, information received in the past couple of months suggests that the recovery is proceeding and that the labor market is improving, albeit gradually. Household spending is increasing, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak.  Owing to a less-than-assured economic outlook and broad uncertainty about public policy, employers appear quite reluctant to add to payrolls. After sizable increases in March and April, private nonfarm payroll employment rose by only 41,000 in May. Employers, however, continue to lengthen workweeks for existing employees. Notably, the workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers in manufacturing reached its highest level since July 2000, and overtime hours per worker now stand at pre-recession levels.  Meanwhile, most broad measures of inflation remain subdued. And long-term inflation expectations appear stable.  Financial conditions, notably, have become less supportive of economic growth. In early May, concerns intensified regarding fiscal difficulties in some European countries. Financial market volatility resurfaced with a vengeance in U.S. markets. The implied volatility of equity prices (VIX) jumped to levels not seen in more than a year. In short-term funding markets, spreads between the Libor (London interbank offered rate) and the OIS (overnight indexed swap) rate widened and commercial paper rates for many issuers jumped. Investors became decidedly less willing to provide funds at longer tenors.  Treasury yields fell to near historic lows, in part as investors sought refuge in dollar-denominated, highly liquid, safe-haven assets. Equity prices, reacting to increased risk and prospects for weaker global growth, also fell. Broad equity price indexes touched lows as much as 14 percent below their recent peak in April. And retail investors may have experienced one scare too many; outflows from equity mutual funds appear to rival the retreat in late 2008. Risk spreads on U.S. investment-grade and high-yield bond prices rose, and corporate bond issuance fell to about half the run-rate of earlier this year. Broad measures of industrial commodity prices decreased substantially from their peaks – mostly on account of weaker expected global demand. There has been, however, some modest improvement across some markets in the most recent weeks.  As I noted, a moderate cyclical recovery characterizes the last several quarters in the United States. But while the recovery is proceeding, investors remain uncertain about its trajectory. Financial market participants are still searching – perhaps better characterized as lurching – for a new equilibrium.  The economy’s path depends in part on whether a new market and public policy equilibrium is established to keep the financial repair process on track. If volatility in financial markets persists at elevated levels, the expected pickup of business fixed investment may disappoint. Business leaders in the United States may react to the latest in a long series of shocks by postponing investments in capital and labor alike. In that way, massive excess cash balances might not be a source of strength, but a reminder of caution.  If, however, volatility levels across asset markets abate – indicating that the financial repair process is continuing – the economic recovery should continue apace. Businesses and consumers would then be better positioned to convert the recovery into a more durable expansion.  An Updated Crisis Response Manual Given recent U.S. experience in responding to the financial crisis, allow me to offer for consideration some ideas to inform the policy response going forward. You can judge for yourselves whether policymakers – at home or abroad – will be receptive to these ideas.  First, don’t blame the mirror. In times of economic weakness or financial distress, policymakers are often troubled by the messages embedded in financial market prices or bank lending statistics. Some supervisors might disagree – even strongly – with the prices markets assign to a banking system’s financial wherewithal. Some elected officials may 
BIS Review 90/2010 3 blame commercial banks for the low levels of lending. Some out-of-favor fiscal authorities may take great umbrage at the prices assigned to their funding costs. Still, outlawing a class of securities or upbraiding an industry tends to be counterproductive.  Second, don’t fall in love with the mirror. In benign economic times, market prices can lull investors and policymakers into a false sense of security. Financial market prices may appear more sanguine about prospects than fundamentals suggest. The cost of issuing a 10-year Treasury bond or German bund might be exceptionally low by historical standards. Inflation expectations may appear well anchored. But this is no guarantee of future performance. Market prices adjust slowly and steadily…until they don’t. Then, market prices can act in a nonlinear fashion. That’s when policymakers end up with fewer, less desirable options. And economies are done harm. So, in each of these messages, we might think of the financial markets as a mirror, a very imperfect but still telling reflection of reality.  Third, facts, not force, should be the predominant policy response. Prevailing wisdom has it that policymakers must overreact when markets do. In my view, this is an uncertain proposition. If a problem were unique or isolated, game theory suggests that overwhelming force might serve policymakers’ interests. But, these problems are not isolated. And it is no game. Markets will continue to clamor for more explicit government commitments. Better to feed the proverbial beast with more facts than force. The Federal Reserve-led stress tests are but one example where the balance was reasonably struck.  Fourth, there are no free lunches, but there is an early-bird special for dinner. Economic trends – fiscal, monetary, trade, or regulatory – tend not to improve when the immediate is continually given preference over the important. The economy’s long-term growth prospects must be given top billing. As economist Charles Schultze reminded us, it is not the wolf at the door but the termites in the walls that require attention.1 The sooner the house’s structure is strengthened, the better.  A Way Forward The job for policymakers, like business leaders, is not getting any easier. There is an understandable tendency – amid an uncertain environment – to defer the tough decisions. But, we might find framing the policy choices – and confronting tough judgments – a prudent way forward.  The most recent round of turmoil in financial markets caused many fiscal authorities around the world to reconsider whether they can spend their way to prosperity. Some are concluding that fiscal consolidation may be the better path to economic expansion. That spending cuts are key to establishing a credible path of fiscal sustainability. That channeling government funds from higher-yielding private-sector activities to lower-yielding public-sector activities undermines economic potential. That fine-tuning aggregate demand requires a precision that is difficult for governments to execute effectively. And, that market forces are often more certain than promised fiscal spending multipliers.  Fiscal policymakers must wrestle with difficult questions of timing, external conditions, economic potential, and policy credibility. Ultimately, in my view, fiscal consolidation happens either when policymakers choose the path, or it gets chosen for them. The former is preferred. The events in Europe remind us that the latter is likely if policymakers do not act in a timely way.                                                   1  Charles L.

4 BIS Review 90/2010 What About the Conduct of Monetary Policy? The challenges for monetary policy are not dissimilar from those confronting the fiscal authorities. The allure of short-term gains must be balanced dispassionately against longer-term and potentially larger consequences.  Last week, the FOMC announced that it would maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent, and it continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Fed announced no changes in the size or composition of its balance sheet. However, the published minutes of recent FOMC meetings make clear that the Committee has been carefully considering critical aspects of its balance sheet policy.  In my view, the Fed should pursue a deliberate, well-communicated strategy that clearly differentiates the path of the Fed’s policy rate from the size and composition of its balance sheet. The Fed’s policy tools should not be conflated or confused. One of the surviving features of the Fed’s extraordinary actions is the breadth of tools at our disposal. They comprise a handy set, and should remind us that every problem is not a nail. And that we have more than the hammer in our toolkit. By considering, communicating, and, potentially, deploying our policy tools independent of one another, we have the best chance to achieve the Federal Reserve’s dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment. I consider the Fed’s policy rate – the federal funds rate – to be the dominant tool in the conduct of operations going forward. It is far and away the most powerful, its effects on the economy and financial markets most clearly understood, and it is the most effective in communicating our intentions. The Fed’s balance sheet of $2.3 trillion – of which $1.6 trillion represents long-term Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt acquired since late 2008 – should be considered, sized, and comprised independently of the policy rate. In my view, the macroeconomic effects of these extraordinary holdings are less significant, their effects on financial market conditions less clear, and the markets’ understanding of our objectives less understood than our dominant tool.  Still, if federal fiscal policy is approaching its political or economic limits, some believe that the Federal Reserve should do more, including expansion of its balance sheet.  In my view, any judgment to expand the balance sheet further should be subject to strict scrutiny. I would want to be convinced that the incremental macroeconomic benefits outweighed any costs owing to erosion of market functioning, perceptions of monetizing indebtedness, crowding-out of private buyers, or loss of central bank credibility. The Fed’s institutional credibility is its most valuable asset, far more consequential to macroeconomic performance than its holdings of long-term Treasury securities or agency securities. That credibility could be meaningfully undermined if we were to take actions that were unlikely to yield clear and significant benefits.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve should continue to give careful consideration to the appropriate size and composition of its existing holdings. Actual sales will not take place in the near term. But, depending on the evolution of the economy and financial markets, we should consider a gradual, prospective exit – communicated well-in-advance – from our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. In making this judgment, we should continue to assess investor demand for these assets. Ultimately, in my view, gradual, predictable asset sales by the Fed should facilitate improvements in mortgage finance and financial markets.  Any sale of assets need not signal that policy rates are soon moving higher. Our policy tools can indeed be used independently. I would note that the Fed successfully communicated and demonstrated its ability to exit from most of its extraordinary liquidity facilities over late 2009 and early 2010, even as it continued its policy of extraordinary accommodation.  
BIS Review 90/2010 5 Conclusion The United States is not Greece. We have the largest, most robust economy in the world. We have the deepest, most liquid financial markets. And the dollar is the world’s reserve currency, bestowing key advantages upon us. But, none of this is our birthright. It must be earned, and re-earned.  The events of the past several years underscore that unanticipated, nonlinear events can happen, even to the most well-intentioned policymakers in the strongest economies in the world. We ought not to be dismissive of the threats to our privileged position in the world. And we should take the necessary measures to ensure that our economy is strong over the long term. 
BIS Review 90/2010 1 Petar Goshev: Some lessons from the crisis Opening address by Mr Petar Goshev, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the 23rd Annual Conference of the Group of Banking Supervisors from Central and Eastern Europe, Ohrid, 15 June 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Participants,  It is an honor for me to share these moments with you exchanging thoughts about, today, the most important questions in the domain of financial intermediation. It is my special pleasure that my address will open the 23rd Annual Conference of the Group of Banking Supervisors from Central and Eastern Europe. There is no doubt that the key words for every supervisory body are liquidity and solvency, as quantities and qualities which are permanently testing the resilience of the banking system in its functioning. Therefore, the standards for liquidity and solvency are constantly being checked from two key aspects: (1) whether, amid various adverse shocks, they are set to maintain satisfactory resilience of the banking system and (2) whether the points of calibration of these key categories at the same time enable efficient, rational financial intermediation. The financial crisis that began in August 2007 clearly shocked the world with its sharpness and, now we can say, its length. Liquidity vanished, many institutions turned insolvent, financial intermediation as the key link in the economic reproduction chain in a lot of places in the world, especially in the developed countries, at certain moments, almost entirely collapsed. Everything was put in question: the current economic theories; monetary and fiscal policies; micro and macroprudential policies; the whole financial regulation. Suddenly, no one was satisfied with the global financial framework. A gallop was started for its reexamining. The fear from recurrence of the crisis and its possible deepening, for almost three years has been keeping the eyes of the creators of the economic and financial policies wide open. Why did this happen to us? A lot has been written in search for the causes of the crisis, and a lot more will be examined and written. One part of the relevant experts say: (1) The so-called “great moderation” period in the GDP and inflation fluctuations was the reason, for which a wrong sense of comfort and illusion was settled, that the crisis period is behind us. Some relevant economic minds convinced us in that. Paul Krugman, in “The Return of Depression Economics” (2008) reminds us of the statement of the Nobel Prize winner Robert Lucas that “the central problem of depression-prevention has been solved, for all practical purposes” and the statement of Ben Bernanke in his famous speech named as “The Great Moderation”, where he claims more than Lucas that the modern macroeconomic policy has solved the business cycle problem or more precisely it has reduced the problem to a point that it is a mere shade rather than the most important economic question. (2) Daniel K. Tarullo, member of the FED Board of Governors finds the reasons in replacing the basic regulatory framework established after the Great Depression 1929–1933, which mostly limited the commercial banks to traditional lending activities, with the regulatory framework that in the 1970s started to install deep changes in the organization and 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 regulation of the financial markets, culminating with the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill in 1999. He says that “with the innovations, the traditional commercial banking business model was put under strong pressure on both sides: on the liability side in the balance sheet of the banks in the form of more attractive savings instruments, such as the funds for investing on the money market, and on the assets side, with the growth of public companies and international competition”. Until the end of the century the restriction cluster on the commercial banks from the great depression era was replaced with a regulatory setting in which they could operate on a national level, to involve in a much broader set of activities and to practically join with every kind of financial companies. Tarullo says, that is how the highly complex financial holding companies were started... the independent investment banks grew in a group of big, complex and highly indebted companies... the financial engineering was quickly changing the character of the entire financial services sector. Securitization and accompanying instruments united the capital markets and traditional lending activities, fueling the growth of the so-called shadow banking system. (3) Allan Greenspan in his latest paper “The Crisis” wrote about the reasons for it: a. “it was the global proliferation of securitized, toxic U.S. subprime mortgages that was the immediate trigger of the current crisis”. But, he says: “the roots of the crisis reach back, as best I can judge, to the aftermath of the Cold War”. Later he explains actually the large increase of the aggregate demand which came from, formerly the third world nations, especially China, which replicated the export-oriented model of the so-called Asian tigers, argumenting it with data that “the savings rate of the developing world soared from 24% of nominal GDP in 1999 to 34% in 2007, far outstripping its investment rate”. b. that “subprime mortgages in the United States for years had been a small appendage to the broader U.S. home mortgage market, comprising only 7% of total originations as recently as 2002”...that “most such loans were fixed-rate mortgages, and only a modest amount had been securitized...” that “..,. starting in late 2003, began to accelerate the pooling and packaging of subprime home mortgages into securities...” that “subprime mortgages securities outstanding in 2007 totaled more than 900 billion USD, a more than six-fold rise since the end of 2001”. c. that “a classic euphoric global bubble took hold”, “that by 2007, yield spreads in the overall debt markets hаd narrowed to a point where there was little room for further under pricing of risk”. ... “that the bubble has reached such a size partly due to the fact that the dot-com bubble burst with very little footprint on global GDP”...that as late as April, 2007 the IMF noted that “global economic risks have declined, the overall U.S. economy is holding up well”; that “many quantitative firms whose number crunching sought to expose profitable market trading principles were successful so long as risk aversion moved incrementally (which it did much of the time)”; that “the risk management paradigm nonetheless, harbored a fatal flaw” i.e. that “in the growing state of high euphoria, risk managers, the Federal Reserve, and other regulators failed to fully comprehend the underlying size, length, and impact of the negative tail of the distribution of risk outcomes that was about to be revealed as the post-Lehman” that “for decades, with little, to no data, most analysts, in my experience, had conjectured a far more limited tail risk” and that “this is arguably the major source of the critical risk management system failures”. “In despair, says Greenspan, an inordinately large part of investment management subcontracted to the ‘safe harbor’ risk designations of the credit rating agencies.” But the 
BIS Review 90/2010 3 analysts of the credit rating agencies proved no more adept and no more proficient at anticipating the onset of crisis than the investment community at large. (4) Oliver Blanchard and other authors, in their paper “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy” stated: “With the neglect of financial intermediation as a central macroeconomic feature, financial regulation and supervision focused on individual institutions and markets and largely ignored their macroeconomic implications. Little thought was given to using regulatory ratios, such as capital ratios, or loan-to-value ratios, as cyclical policy tools.” By analyzing the reasons we came up with many lessons, which it has delivered up to this moment. For some of the questions there is already a global consensus. For others, it still has to be constructed. For some questions there is a general consensus, but the devil is in the details and therefore there are and there will be confronting opinions that demand time for adjustment until they become operative and applicable.  What lessons could be, at the moment, more relevant? I. There is an agreement that a global crisis in a highly interdependent world needs a global response. A global response needs global institutions, a global economic and financial architecture. Current institutions have proved to be insufficient and inefficient. Generally, the structure of that global architecture is already drawn and its shaping is moving in a good direction.  The G20 group was constituted early during the crisis, as a main forum for international discussion on the global economic stability;  Under the patronage of the G20 the Financial Stability Board, previously the Financial Stability Forum, increased the number of its member states from 12 to 24, and the area of competence as well. Now it secures unprecedented degree of international coordination in the field of the regulatory questions, as an addition to the old mandate as the Financial Stability Forum. FSB is now empowered with additional assignments, including: (i) undertaking joint strategic reviews of policy development of the international standard setting bodies;  (ii) setting guidelines for, and supporting, the establishment of supervisory colleges;  (iii) supporting contingency planning for cross-border crisis management.  The International Monetary Fund has refocused its activity on monitoring the international financial system, identifying threats to the global financial stability;  In Europe, based on current draft legislation, the financial supervision will be characterized by a two-pillar structure. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) will be responsible for macro-prudent supervision of the European financial system as a whole, while the European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS) will be focused on micro-prudent supervision. ESRB will be especially focused on the potential threads to the financial stability arising from the macro-economic developments, as well as the developments in the financial system as a whole. It will issue general warnings or warnings for specific aspects (e.g. on a country level or on a specific industry level, in every case when the risks seem significant). When necessary, it will give recommendations for action to deal with the risks and it will monitor the compliance with the given recommendations.  ESFS will maintain the dialog with ESRB and it will deliver the recommendations to the national supervisors, who will adhere to the principle “act or explain”.  
4 BIS Review 90/2010 II. After the crisis there is a strong consensus concerning the weaknesses of the prudential policy and the imperative for its fundamental improvement. Nobody disputes the fact that the prudential policy should be characterized by two dimensions: the micro-prudential, designed to limit the instability of the individual banks; and macro-prudential, designed to limit the risk of the financial stability as a whole, meaning, to limit the so-called systemic risk. The macro-prudential dimension becomes increasingly important. The Bank for International Settlements defines the macro-prudential policy as “the use of prudential tools with the explicit objective of promoting the stability of the financial system as a whole, not necessarily of the individual institutions within it”. (BIS Quarterly review, Мarch 2010) “The objective of macro-prudential policy is to reduce systemic risk by explicitly addressing the interlinkages between, and common exposures of, all financial institutions, and the procyclicality of the financial system. That is, systemic risk is to be reduced in its cross-sectional dimension and its time dimension, respectively.” (Jaime Caruana, 2010)  The recent BIS papers, designed to create operating macroprudential approach, suggest several leading principles for designing the macroprudential tools. Firstly, they need to be calibrated according to the contribution of each individual institution to the potential systemic risk, regardless of the institution’s legal form, meaning that every important company must be included in the perimeter of the regulation. Secondly, a way should be found to reduce the procyclicality of the financial system.  Thirdly, a thorough study of the various available (macroprudential) tools should be conducted, to their potential usefulness and to the empirical evidence of their impact and effectiveness. The BIS analyses have registered many tools used by the Asian countries: (i) countercyclical capital buffers linked to credit growth (China); countercyclical provisioning (China, India);  (ii) loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (China, Hong Kong SAR, The Republic of Korea, Singapore);  (iii) direct controls on lending to specific sectors (The Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore) oriented toward managing the aggregate risk throughout the business cycle (i.e. procyclicality);  furthermore, (iv) capital surcharges for systemically important banks (China, India, Philippines, Singapore);  (v) liquidity requirements funding (India, The Republic of Korea, Philippines, Singapore ; (vi) limits on currency mismatches (India, Malaysia, Philippines);  (vii) loan to deposit requirements (China, The Republic of Korea), as a tool for managing the aggregate risk in every point in time (systemic oversight). These examples show that the macroprudential tools could have an effect on the vulnerabilities by increasing the financial sector resilience. The Basel Committee has already proposed the following tools:  - countercyclical capital framework. This will require from the financial institutions to build up capital in good times, that can be drawn upon in periods of stress; - forward looking provisioning. Banks are encouraged to allocate provisions based on expected losses, as opposed to allocating provisions on the basis of incurred loss. This approach is less procyclical than the so-called “incurred loss” provisioning model.  
BIS Review 90/2010 5 - capital conservation measures. This measure includes activities aimed at restricting oversized payments of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation payments by financial institutions. Capital requirements are undoubtedly the foundations of the microprudential regulation, but they also have a macroprudent dimension related to the procyclicality of the financial sector. Capital buffers which should confront procyclicality should meet two objectives: first, they should help the banking system handle the risks which could materialize in periods of crisis, and second, they should mitigate the reduction of the economic activity in a situation of downward movement of the economy. Nevertheless, several key issues remain open for discussion. Should the discretionary interventions on the buffers be reduced to the minimum, in order to prevent regulatory capture? On which geographical level should the aggregation be adopted in order to calibrate the buffers? ”For example (Giovanni Carosio, June, 2010) says, in the euro area should it be linked to area-wide variables (credit growth), to address level playing field concerns, or should we leave the door open to disaggregated measures, as I will argue below? And would market pressures allow banks to run down the buffer in a downturn?” As for the systemic risk which arises from the liquidity dry-ups, Carosio writes that no uncontroversial solution has been found yet. The Basel Committee proposed new standards (for example, The liquidity coverage ratio and Net stable funding ratio). It seems, Carosio says, that they are powerful instruments, but are still very micro-prudential in nature and do not necessarily address the “fallacy of composition” that is typically of liquidity...In principle (he continues) the systemic dimension of liquidity risk could be addressed by designing a countercyclical liquidity buffer, similar to the capital buffer ..., possibly without raising overall liquidity requirements. An important advantage of this option would be to eliminate the procyclicality of the micro-prudential liquidity regulation in its current formulation; a disadvantage would be an added layer of complexity.” (Tobias Adrian and Markus Brunnermeier) According to Carosio, another solution would be the one proposed by Perotti, Enrico and Javier Suarez (2009) “to levy charges on banks funding maturity, a proxy for systemic liquidity risk” and the one proposed by Tobias Adrian and Markus Brunnermeier, “to tie levies to measures of systemic risk” or the one proposed by Nicoletti Alltimari, Sergio and Salleo (2010), “to devise market instrument that make liquidity available on a contingent basis, when a systemic trigger is activated”. Undoubtedly, these issues require additional analysis and work. In the area of the microprudential regulation, the Basel Committee, as we all know, in December last year proposed an impressive collection of reforms aimed at increasing the resilience of the individual financial institutions in case of panic and stress. Without elaboration, I would only mention the following: First, increasing the quality and the quantity of the capital; Second, increasing the capital charges on the basis of the trading portfolio; Third, introducing of a leverage ratio for the financial institutions. Fourth, improvement of risk management and disclosures, as the crisis has revealed the weaknesses of the so-called “improved” risk management techniques on the basis of the internal risk models. Fifth, special attention should be paid to the so-called counter party credit risk from OTC derivatives. It became evident that these markets bear risks both for the individual financial institutions (microprudential) and for the financial system (macroprudential). Namely, OTC derivatives are traded bilaterally between banks, other financial institutions and 
6 BIS Review 90/2010 corporations. They are not traded through the stock exchange, making difficulties in discovering where the last risk is located, i.e. who bears the last risk. Another set of tools should find a solution for the systemically important financial institutions, extremely complex question, extremely important for the systemic stability of the financial sector.  Except for the general agreement about the need of adequate harmonization of the prudential regulation, as the systemically important financial institutions are almost all “cross-border” by their nature, so far no higher consensus on solutions regarding this matter has been reached. In the current discussion, basically there are two distinctive approaches, starting from three key features of the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs): their size, complexity and inter-linkedness. According to one of the approaches, no institution is too big, complicated or linked to fail. In this sense, there are proposals to limit the size of the banks and to separate commercial from investment banking, disintegrate conglomerates by living wills, etc. Some argue that “this reasoning is controversial as the effectiveness of these measures depends on the specific features of a relatively small number of SIFIs; different countries will probably come up with different solutions”. (Carosio)  Although it is possible, he says, to reach an agreement on some of these proposals, in particular on resolution mechanisms, others (e.g. breaking up institutions according to some criterion) would require a broad international political consensus, which seems unlikely at this stage. The second approach would be directed toward seeking additional capital requirement, or a tax, according to the measure for systemic relevance. Taxation seems, according to Carosio, more adequate in a burden-sharing perspective. “The solution, in my judgment”, says Greenspan “that has at least a reasonable chance of reversing the extraordinarily large ‘moral hazard’ that has arisen over the past year is to require banks and possibly all financial intermediaries to hold contingent capital bonds, that is, debt which is automatically converted to equity when equity capital falls below a certain threshold”.  “However, should contingent capital bonds prove insufficient, we should allow large institutions to fail, and if assessed by regulators as too interconnected to liquidate quickly, be taken into a special bankruptcy facility”. So, he supports the second approach, and in that light is the latest legislation in the USA which is about to be adopted, as well as the proposals in Europe which envisage measures of this kind. Namely, “Restoring American Financial Stability Act”, which was passed in the US Senate on May 20, would impose significant new obligations and restrictions for the SIFIs, envisaging a possibility for the FED to introduce rising strict rules for capital, leverage and liquidity. On the other hand, on May 26, the European Commission proposed the Member States to establish national funds, financed from taxes imposed on the financial sector, in order to assist in closing or reorganizing the unsuccessful banks.  The macroprudent tools mentioned so far, do not by any means exhaust the list of suggestions. Exploring adequate instruments continues, and we are all waiting to see what will be delivered both in the form of ideas and in the form of operational tools. III. The crisis has proved that the price stability is not sufficient to achieve financial stability. 
BIS Review 90/2010 7 Basically, with small exceptions that have no impact on the adoption of political decisions, the dangerous influence of the growing imbalances in the financial system was not conceived. The central banks were happy for registering low inflation rates, so it seemed to sidetrack the rapid credit growth; the lower risk aversion; the increase in asset prices, and consequently, the mounting vulnerability on the financial market. That is why, O. Blanchard and others, (2010) say that: “the crisis has made clear that policymakers have to watch many targets, including the composition of output, the behavior of asset prices, and the leverage of different agents. It has also made clear that they have potentially many more instruments at their disposal than they used before the crisis. The challenge is to learn how to use these instruments in the best way.” Recently, Petra M. Geraats (Mаy 2010), concluded in the same direction: “Recent financial crises have revealed that a ‘nice’ (non-inflationary, continuously expanding) economy can mask the build up of toxic imbalances that threaten the financial system. So it is vital for policymakers to proactively pursue not only price but also financial stability. Although the pursuit of both objectives could give rise to uncomfortable trade-offs, these can be bypassed by supplementing the main instrument of monetary policy, with tools for prudential policy, in line with the Tinbergen rule.” Accordingly, asking whether the central banks should have double mandate and answering affirmatively, she (Petra M. Geraats) says: “Although the twin goals sometimes give rise to dueling demands, with an appropriate policy framework central banks can accomplish both and achieve a dual mandate of price and financial stability”. Definitely, the consensus for this point of view is mounting, since larger number of authors are basically on the same line.  Тhis highlights the importance of ongoing efforts to strengthen the macro-prudential supervision role of central banks (de Larosiere, 2009).  Macro-prudential policies could aim to contain the build up of financial imbalances and ensure that the financial system is sufficiently resistant to withstand a disorderly unwinding (Papademos, 2009). Considering the important informational synergies between micro-prudential supervision and systemic risk analysis, bringing micro-supervision under the same roof as other central bank functions seems an attractive proposition. Central banks can benefit from, and rely on, extended access to supervisory information and intelligence, especially on systemically relevant intermediaries, in order to better assess risks and vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole (A. Orphanides, May 2010).  It is not necessary to say, because it is obvious, that I share the same opinion.  IV. The crisis also showed that there is no financial stability by pursuing profligate fiscal policy.  The latest developments in Europe whetted this issue. The decisions of the governments, as one of the basic economic actors, have enormous influence on the aggregate demand. Therefore, the fiscal policy has key role as a shock absorber, contributing to the maintenance of the financial stability. However, we witness that many governments are ignorant to that. Why it is so, is not hard to guess, but watching this “sobering” in Europe, it is obvious that the crisis helped to firm up the following perspectives: 1) The fiscal policy should be countercyclical. It should have cyclically adjusted balanced budget rules adopted; 2) The fiscal policy must not be a source of shocks. If looking over the fiscal deficits in certain countries, it can be perceived that, there, it is far from that; 
8 BIS Review 90/2010 That is why the old ideas for the need of establishing independent fiscal agencies and minimal framework which will guarantee independence to the statistical agencies competent for the national accounts, resurrected. It is impressive what Germany commenced. To incorporate fiscal stability through the highest act in the country, the constitution. V. As usual, the establishment of a new action framework is one thing, while whether this framework will become operational, functional, and to what extent, is another thing. It is obvious that the bunch of new ideas, new tools we talk about forced by the crisis, are focused on establishing a concept for managing systemic risk. Therefore, the questions whether it will function, on what the result depends most, are logical.  1) First, the systemic risk is not too hard to define. It is harder to provide operative contents, because of its different dimensions: procyclicality; contagion risk; the spillover effects of a single institution’s distress to the rest of the financial system; correlation risk; concentration risk; then, due to the fact that the risk can originate from several sources, etc. 2) Even when the source is identified, the history shows that there is no action at all, or the action is delayed, or the seriousness of the threat is underestimated. For example, the false reports of the Greek government for the real fiscal deficits were not unknown. And not only for theirs. It is not untrue that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have proposed to the Congress a gradual reduction or possible extinction of the GSEs portfolio (Fannie Mac и Freddy Mac), quite before 2004 when their assets were several times smaller than US Dollar 3.2 trillion at the end of 2007. I would like to say that the matters always crucially depended on the competence, potential and the positive political will of those who represent and manifest the people’s sovereignty. It will be so in future, as well.  3) In the globalized world, when it became apparent that the systemic crises exceed the borders of one national jurisdiction easily, the issue of the global financial architecture and the issue of coordination, gain extremely high significance.  The new regulatory architecture I spoke about at the beginning, the examples for cooperation of the concerned governments and central banks during this crisis are truly encouraging. However, this path is full of scyllas and haribdas. Many obstacles need to be overcome. The paradigm “think globally, act locally” was and it still is very much manipulated by the local leaders who need the votes of the local voters to be as they like it. This mentality guarantees no financial stability. This path needs a lot of work.  VI. Where is the Republic of Macedonia with respect to these trends? Our general policy is to adhere to the suggestions and the recommendations of the Basle Committee. Regarding the modification in the defining of the core capital, the current methodology on determining the banks’ capital adequacy already contains the approach proposed by the Basle Committee as regards to the deductable items. The requirement to make analysis in the following period of the need of modification to the other elements of the own funds, the capital quality, which can be qualified for risk coverage, as well as the introduction of countercyclical capital protection mechanisms remains. Also, the proposals for introducing the leverage ratio are in the process of analysis.  The Basle Committee and the International Board for Accounting Standards in the MSFI 9 proposal support the creation of impairment based on the anticipated loss principle, and not on the incurred loss principle, as the current International Accounting Standards envisage. In the regulations pertaining to the credit risk management we apply the anticipated loss principle.  
BIS Review 90/2010 9 Despite the intentions for accepting the International Accounting Standards, our valid methodology for classifying the credit risk exposure contains prudent filter, which requires from the banks primarily to know the debtor’s characteristics, its credit history and expectations regarding the payment of its liabilities.  Such a solution in the regulations in line with the Basle recommendations, enabled our banks to have relatively sufficient amount of impairment for covering the incurred credit losses during the entire turbulent period, which prevented serious pressures on their capital base.  The crisis showed that even well capitalized banks can be seriously affected, if they fail to have adequate level of liquidity. The Basle Committee developed two minimal liquidity ratios, short-term liquidity up to 30 days and second ratio with longer term character and represents structural liquidity ratio.  As a supplement to the proposed minimal liquidity ratios, the Basle Committee published a revised version of the principles for safe management and supervision of the liquidity risk. We have proactive role also regarding this measure. Last year we prepared and adopted a regulation that requires from the banks to adhere to two liquidity ratios: (1) up to 30 days and (2) up to 180 days, in Denars and foreign exchange, individually. In that way, we encompassed both, the short-term and the long-term aspect of the liquidity.  The results from the application of this measure are good. At the end of 2009, we have registered the following: the volume of the liquid assets is significantly over the level registered at the end of 2008; all liquidity indicators improved; the gap between the assets and liabilities from the aspect of their contractual maturity and the high percentage of stable deposits decreased.  The history showed again that the financial stability is precious and it represents public good for society.  Let us try to learn the true lessons from the latest crisis. I wish you a successful work and pleasant stay in Macedonia.  References 1. Blanchard Olivier, Giovanni Dell’Ariccia and Paolo Mauro (2010), “Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy”, IMF. 2.

BIS Review 90/2010 1 Kiyohiko G Nishimura: Financial regulations – Asian perspectives Remarks by Mr Kiyohiko G Nishimura, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Panel Session “Financial Development and Regulatory Coordination under New Circumstances”, at Lujiazui Forum Annual Meeting 2010, Shanghai, 26 June 2010. *      *      * First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the hosts for inviting me to the Lujiazui Forum and especially to this panel on financial reforms. I am particularly delighted to be given the opportunity to discuss the pressing issue of financial reform, which will shape the future landscape of the global economy. In this short presentation, I would like to argue the following two points:  Firstly, the financial innovations of the past quarter century have blurred the dividing line between banks and non-banks. These developments have made it possible to shift risk back and forth between the banking system and capital markets. It has become difficult to locate exactly where ultimate risk lies, and the banking system has found itself so often vulnerable to the volatility of capital markets. The Volcker Rule and related financial reform proposals are designed to rectify these problems. Secondly, however, we should recognize the significant regional differences in banks’ business models along this bank/non-bank spectrum. Financial reforms should thus follow a carefully-timed and well-balanced approach, taking explicit account of regional and functional heterogeneity. Banks more like non-banks and non-banks more like banks: rationale for the Volcker Rule It may sound a bit farfetched, but the global financial crisis of the last few years might have been brought about partly by banks becoming more like non-banks and non-banks becoming more like banks. Some banks are now non-bank-like, as exemplified in the current financial jargon used to describe these banks’ business practices, such as “originate to distribute model” and “prop trading”, while some non-banks have become bank-like, as the phrase “shadow banking system” suggests.  The financial innovations behind these changes are in essence welcome developments, helping to improve efficiency by shifting risk among economic agents. However, they have made it increasingly difficult to locate the whereabouts of ultimate risk. Vital information regarding banks’ risk exposures has been literally “lost in transformation” in the originate-to-distribute model and various proprietary derivative trades. We have been unable to identify what risks a particular bank has been exposed to, and, as a consequence, those facing the financial system as a whole. As we all know only too well, heightened concern over counter-party risks led to severe dysfunction in financial markets, particularly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the bailout of AIG in September 2008.  The problems surfaced most acutely in the United States. Thus we have observed the bold attempts at regulatory overhaul in the U.S., of which the so-called Volcker Rule has become something of an icon. In my understanding, the Volcker Rule is designed to deter banks from taking excessive risk in capital markets, where volatility is inherently high and in which bankers do not necessarily have informational advantage in predicting market developments. Rather, the Volcker Rule urges banks to return to their traditional stronghold of commercial banking business, in which they can utilize their informational advantage based on long-term relationships with their customers. In other words, the rule attempts to insulate long-horizon relationship banking from the occasional brutality of the sometime short-horizon capital markets. In this way, we can prevent the possible misuse of public assistance given to banks. 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 The rationale for the Volcker Rule could be applied to liquidity risk management as well. That is, commercial banks should not rely too much on fickle wholesale funding, but should focus more on stable deposits based on long-term relationships with their customers.  Asian perspectives of heterogeneity: don’t put carnivorous lions and herbivorous elephants in the same cage  Here I cannot help feeling that this rule is quite congenial to the traditional Japanese, and probably Asian, view of what banks are. In Japan, loans constitute roughly half of corporate debt financing, and deposits roughly three quarters of banks’ balance sheets. Long-term relationships are the rule, not the exception. I believe this dominant role of the banking sector in the financial system is more or less similar in the rest of Asia as well. It is no coincidence that financial systems in the Asia region have remained relatively stable during the current crisis: we have not suffered a serious deterioration in confidence or market dysfunction, since our banks have largely remained as traditional banks, and shadow banking had at most a limited presence.  In order to prevent another global financial crisis of this magnitude, we truly need a thorough and internationally harmonized overhaul of financial regulations, as is currently being undertaken by various international regulatory bodies. However, as mentioned before, proper consideration must be given to the regional heterogeneity of banks’ business functions, especially in the bank/non-bank spectrum. The difference is not arbitrary but reflects real structural differences between regions. In particular, it would be unrealistic to always assume that “one size fits all”: We should not put carnivorous lions and herbivorous elephants in the same cage. We should also follow a well-balanced approach that properly recognizes the synergetic cross-effects of item-by-item regulations. An appropriate criterion should be the combined effects of all item-by-item regulations. Simply focusing on the “marginal effects” of individual measures may be misleading, even though they have good individual rationale. At the same time, we should be aware of a possible trade-off between the long-term benefits and short-term costs of stronger regulations. Such regulations may indeed enhance financial stability and economic prosperity in the long run, but the hasty implementation of stringent regulations may hamper a fragile recovery, such as we find ourselves in now. Let me stop here for further discussion. Thank you for your kind attention. 
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview in La Repubblica Interview with Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, in La Repubblica, Italy, conducted by Ms Elena Polidori on 16 June 2010 and published on 24 June 2010. *      *      * Mr President, you always get angry about governments’ lack of discipline in terms of managing public finances. Now, after the case of Greece and the speculation that followed, many countries – including Italy – have taken measures. Are the steps that have been taken correct? Are they sufficient? “The delicacy of the current situation requires credible measures, this is very important. It is necessary in order to correct divergent paths. Sustainable fiscal policies will help to consolidate the recovery. Governments have solemnly stated that they are aware of this need, and have decided to bring forward consolidation measures. But the credibility of their measures will be subject to constant scrutiny.” Are you saying that you will monitoring them? “That is the task of the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB. We are very attentive in this respect.” Italy has also launched a fiscal adjustment package, which is, however, half the size of the packages of France and Germany. Is it enough? Or will a further package be needed shortly?  “The measures taken on 25 May go in the right direction, namely they underpin the stability programme of the country. We are reviewing the situation at this stage and attach importance to the assessment of the Commission, taking into account its Treaty responsibility to monitor, evaluate and make recommendations to the Council.” But the Commission has already given its preliminary assessment.  “To my knowledge, the package has not yet been assessed in detail. As I said, the Italian measures go in the right direction, underpinning the stability programme.” The Italian plan is lacking measures with regard to growth and employment. Are these not important? Do you have any suggestions for the government? “We call upon all governments, not just the Italian government, to show determination in making structural reforms to increase potential growth. I place great emphasis on the need to increase labour productivity, for in the medium and long term, growth is dependent on this very factor. And that is why we say that this is a crucial reform for all countries, and Italy as well.” One cut after another: many economists say that there is a clear risk of deflation. What are your views on this?  “I don’t think that such risks could materialise. On the contrary, inflation expectations are remarkably well anchored in line with our definition – less than 2%, close to 2% – and have remained so during the recent crisis. As regards the economy, the idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.” Incorrect? “Yes. In fact, in these circumstances, everything that helps to increase the confidence of households, firms and investors in the sustainability of public finances is good for the consolidation of growth and job creation. I firmly believe that in the current circumstances 
2 BIS Review 88/2010 confidence-inspiring policies will foster and not hamper economic recovery, because confidence is the key factor today.” Which countries are most at risk after Greece?  I have no particular comments on that. All countries are on their way to put their house in order. There is talk of difficulties in Spain and among Spanish banks … I have just responded to the question. Will you say whether the euro itself is at risk? “The euro is a very credible currency. It has kept its value from the start in a way that is remarkable and has ensured price stability for 11½ years. Average annual inflation in the euro area over this period has been 1.98%, in line with our definition of price stability, and this is the best result recorded since the Second World War in all of the euro area economies. A currency which safeguards price stability is a major asset in the eyes of investors, both domestic and international.” Is the sovereign debt crisis worse than the sub-prime crisis?  “I will say that the situation we are experiencing at the moment, in Europe and in the world, was triggered by the financial crisis, which had a very significant impact on the deterioration of public finances everywhere. It is a global phenomenon. I am confident that governments will manage to overcome these difficulties.” Truthfully, did you expect all of this turmoil?  “I am convinced that we always have to be alert. Credibly alert. Without causing alarmism.” Do you think that there will be a federal government of Europe? “European integration is a historic process which can only be understood from a long-term perspective. We will see whether in the end the institutional framework will be a political federation or a confederation of sovereign states, or whether other imaginative options will be explored. In the end, it is the people of Europe who will decide. That said, when you have a single currency, you need a set of very strict fiscal rules.” There is the Stability and Growth Pact… “…which for us should be the equivalent of a federal budget in terms of ensuring sound policies. This is why we want the Stability and Growth Pact to be strong, solid and fully respected.” Maastricht is going to be reformed and made stricter.  “Yes. All the aspects relating to multilateral surveillance are to be strengthened, at the level of the 27 EU countries and of the 16 euro area countries. We consider that a “quantum leap” has to be made in terms of improving the surveillance of fiscal policies, of competitiveness and of structural reforms. We made our proposals to the Van Rompuy task force and I explained to the European Parliament that we had to use absolutely all the possibilities offered by the “secondary legislation” of the European Union to strengthen surveillance.” Do you just look at fiscal policy?  “No. We also have to look very closely at the evolution of competitiveness and, in particular, of indicators of competitiveness such as unit labour costs and the level of national inflation by comparison with that of the euro area. It is also important to monitor very closely the information on the structural reforms of every member country.” How do you keep at bay members of the ECB’s Governing Council, such as the German Weber, who are opposed to purchasing the bonds of weak countries?  
BIS Review 88/2010 3 “I have no comment on that, the decisions are taken by the Governing Council.” Germany has implemented a tough austerity plan, which has been subject to a great deal of criticism. Is it a good or a bad thing?  “It is important that all countries that have budget problems demonstrate that they can implement credible policies in the medium to long term. This will increase the confidence of households, investors and firms and, therefore, consolidate the recovery.” But is it a good thing or a bad thing? “Good. I am pleased that the German government is concentrating on discipline. And what I think about Germany also applies to the others.” The IMF is intervening in the European crisis. You were sceptical about this at the beginning, were you not? “I thought from the very beginning that we needed the full involvement of the European peers, with the Eurogroup in particular assuming all its responsibilities. It is what has been decided. Provided that the Commission and the Eurogroup were fully involved, the cooperation between the Commission, the ECB and the IMF was desirable and has been excellent.” Are concrete results to be expected from the G20 in Toronto with regard to the future financial system? Will you be discussing a bank tax, banks’ capital or rating agencies? “These are all important elements. We had a good preparatory meeting in Korea, at the level of ministers and governors. I am confident that we are on the right track, knowing that a number of important decisions are to be taken at the G20 meeting in November this year.” Mr President, your mandate is coming to an end. Governor Mario Draghi is one of the candidates to succeed you. What kind of profile will your successor need? “I have a very heavy responsibility, with all my colleagues of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council. And my mandate expires in one year and four months. That is a long and demanding period of time. It is premature for me to comment on my possible successor.” 
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: Financial inclusion through the agent banking model and credit reference bureaus Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the official opening of Fina Bank’s, Ngong Road Branch, Nairobi, 17 June 2010. *      *      * The Chairman and Board Members; Group Chief Operating Officer; Management and Staff; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: It gives me great pleasure to be with you today at the official opening of Fina Bank’s, Ngong Road Branch. As the regulator for the Banking Sector, the Central Bank is pleased to be associated with the achievements of the banks we regulate, particularly where these developments lead to increased access to banking services for the Kenyan public. This is what Fina Bank is doing this evening.  It is evident that Fina Bank is focused on its programme of expansion and growth strategy, having started its operations as Finance Institution of Africa in 1986 before converting to the present day Fina Bank in 1996. With the opening of this branch, the bank will have a network of 14 branches in the country. I also note that the bank has established its presence regionally by opening subsidiaries in Uganda and Rwanda. This is encouraging indeed. Mr. Chairman, let me take this opportunity to compliment the Board, Management and Staff of Fina Bank for this great achievement. I note that as at April 2010, the bank commanded an impressive asset portfolio of Ksh.13.5 billion and customer deposits of Ksh.11.5 billion, while riding on a capital base of Ksh.1.3 billion. The Central Bank is particularly encouraged by the bank’s leading role as a lender in the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) sector, a growth sector in Kenya’s economy which has been described as the “jewel” of Kenya’s economic growth. This is indeed important following from the Budget proposals that created a revolving fund for SME – It may well be the best policy in our times to support the growth pole provided by SMEs. Ladies and Gentlemen, Kenya’s growth picked up in the last quarter of 2009, extending into 2010 and on the back of good rainfall and a resurgence of tourism, we are optimistic that this positive trend will continue, and therefore forecast that the economy will post a 4 to 5 percent growth in 2010 on average.  Equally the banks have had a spectacular performance. For the period ended March 31, 2010, the Kenyan Banking sector registered an increase in asset base largely supported by growth in deposits. Assets increased by 20.8 percent to stand at Ksh.1.5 trillion while deposits increased by 22.8 percent to Ksh.1.1 trillion. This growth is by and large attributed to the growth of our economy that increases opportunities for investment and demand for credit. The Central Bank is pleased to note that the banking sector has put up strategies that support and stimulate the economy and responded positively to the successive reduction of the Central Bank Rate and Cash Reserve Ratio. While it is noteworthy and encouraging for banks to post healthy profits, this should also go in tandem with the reduction of lending rates to stimulate private sector borrowing and financing of investments, working capital as well as reducing the risks of default. At this juncture I want to register my compliments to Fina Bank for having reduced its base lending rate to 14.75 percent. I am sure there is room to do more. The continued lowering of base lending rates by commercial banks will not only stimulate our 
2 BIS Review 88/2010 economy but also reduce non-performing loans in the industry. However, lending rates reduces the risk of default.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The Central Bank will endeavour to pursue prudent policies that foster financial stability, increase financial inclusion and improve financial efficiency. Let me at this juncture highlight two policy issues that are at the heart of the of financial inclusion;  Agent Banking Model: An amendment to the Banking Act through the Finance Act 2009 has enabled the banking industry embrace agent banking. Agent banking will permit banks to contract third parties to provide certain banking services on their behalf without having to put up brick and mortar. This model will therefore increase financial inclusion to the majority of the unbanked Kenyans at an affordable cost to both the bank and the customer. The Central Bank is pleased by the level of interest and financial innovation the model has generated.  Credit Reference Bureaus: To ensure the growth of credit lending at affordable and sustainable rates, the Central Bank has licensed the first Credit Reference Bureau (CRB) and a few more are in the pipeline. A robust credit information apparatus will enable the banking industry share critical customer information that will lead to lowering the credit risk in the industry and hence the lowering of lending rates in the banking industry. This policy aims at building information capital that will allow the credit market to function properly and efficiently and change the collateral technology and reduce the cost of collateralization. The Central Bank of Kenya will continue to pursue policies that drive financial innovation, build strong banks and partnerships in the banking industry to ensure a stable financial sector in the country. Strong banks can weather shocks more easily. Strong banks will support economic growth. Ladies and Gentlemen, I wish to conclude by congratulating Fina Bank for opening the Ngong Road Branch and to assure the Board and Management of Fina Bank of the Central Bank’s support in your growth initiatives and progression.  With these few remarks Ladies and Gentlemen, it is now my honour and pleasure to declare Fina Bank – Ngong Road Branch – officially open.  Thank You and God bless you all. 
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Muhammad bin Ibrahim: Sustainable financial inclusion Closing remarks by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) Data Workshop, Lanai Kijang, Kuala Lumpur, 22 June 2010. *      *      * Introduction Thank you for giving me this opportunity to deliver the closing remarks for the AFI-BNM Financial Inclusion Data Workshop. Bank Negara Malaysia is honored to co-host this event with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion. The pursuit of sustainable financial inclusion has become a matter of priority as well as urgency in many countries, and is relevant to both the developed and developing economies. The need for financial inclusion, especially for the developing countries, is undeniable. Beyond the potential of being able to uplift the millions of financially underserved poor from the unending cycle of poverty, an inclusive financial system contributes towards greater social, economic, and political stability, a vital ingredient for growth. At the same time, we must also be wary of the increase in situations where access to finance leads to over-indebtedness. Over-indebtedness can be the cause of much emotional hardship and stress, and might result in social exclusion. Hence, financial inclusion must take into account sustainability, and in this respect a balanced approach is important. It is this trade off that pose challenge to regulators or oversight authorities. Malaysian experience on the financial inclusion agenda Allow me to reflect on the Malaysian experience for financial inclusion. In Malaysia, financial inclusion is a national agenda. It is key in formulating socio-economic programs including the Government Transformation Plan, the New Economic Model and the 10th Malaysia Plan. This commitment towards financial inclusion is reflected in the Central Bank Act 2009, where financial inclusion is legislated as an objective of Bank Negara Malaysia. The efforts to develop a more inclusive financial system have been fruitful. More than 80% of the Malaysian population currently has some form of savings account. Compared to the global median of 8.4 bank branches per 100,000 individuals, Malaysia has 15.5 branches per 100,000 individuals (31 March 2010) with the number of ATM cards in circulation increasing from 19.8 million (Dec 2006) to 28 million (April 2010), with an average annual growth rate of 11% in the last four years. Another important indicator is the total microfinance loans outstanding, which has increased from USD 45 million (RM 151 million) as at end-2000 to USD 757 million (RM 2.5 billion) as at end-March 2010, a compounded annual growth rate of 35.5%. While such positive trends are encouraging, we are also mindful of the associated risks, such as non-performing loans, over-indebtedness and consumption of financial products and services that are not suitable for the user. In this regard, efforts towards financial inclusion are always conducted within the framework of sound banking practices, risk management and adequate consumer protection.  Importance of financial inclusion data in the growth and development of an inclusive economic system Policy formulation for financial inclusion is complex for a number of reasons. First, it requires the active involvement of many different stakeholders, in particular Government agencies and very often a variety of NGOs, as well as financial institutions with specialized skills and knowledge. Second, the state of economic and social development of a society is an 
2 BIS Review 88/2010 important determinant on the level and quality of financial inclusion. Third, what constitutes acceptable level of inclusion, in terms of access to finance, protection of personal rights and liberties, or assurance of retirement and healthcare benefits varies from one jurisdiction to another. For the reasons that I mentioned, there is no uniform global benchmark that can be used as a successful model for financial inclusion programs. Success stories and experiences are dispersed and often go unrecorded and to further the cause we need to reveals this situation. The financial inclusion agenda requires a systematic and internationally-recognized set of financial inclusion indicators that is meaningful and capable of assisting us in formulating developmental policies. Furthermore, enormous efficiency gains from the availability of such indicators can both reduce the cost of research and implementation as well as increase the effectiveness of the delivery and execution of the policies. Lessons learned in using financial inclusion data in the Malaysian context Let me to briefly share some of the lessons we have learnt in terms of using data to improve the policy formulation process, and develop a more efficient and inclusive financial sector. Perhaps the most interesting example is the development of quality credit data which has enabled financial institutions to make informed and responsible lending decisions in a timely manner and to be able to mitigate serious problems such as fraud. These data have also assisted Bank Negara Malaysia in performing its macro- and micro-surveillance duties and in its policy-making role. The data in this case came from the development of a comprehensive credit registry system. The availability of such data also allows individuals with good payment track records to make a more credible case for access to credit, and helps overcome the limitation of inadequate collateral. Another example is the collaborative project with the Department of Statistics Malaysia to conduct the Baseline Census of Establishments and Enterprises in 2005. The data gathered from this initiative enabled the policy-makers to have a much more detailed profile of the SME and micro-enterprise segments of the economy. The insights gained led to a new understanding of the SME business landscape, and the launch of a national strategy for SME development. Specific strategies could be developed, and the availability of data helped in having more constructive dialogue between different stakeholders. We also note that relatively new policy areas for financial inclusion require better data that enable validation of policy stance, or in some cases change in policy direction. Inadequate or inconclusive data in areas such as measuring financial literacy, consumer awareness and financial education means that it is difficult to assess the cost and benefit of the proposed policy framework and its impact on financial inclusion.  Conclusion Allow me to now conclude my remarks. The successful implementation of policy work in the area of financial inclusion requires the availability of quality data. The fact that this area still remains relatively unexplored, compared to the availability of data for corporate business, financial markets and other more sophisticated aspects of finance, clearly suggests that much work remains to be done. The magnitude and scope of the topic also requires a diverse group of policymakers to collaborate on a long-term basis. The establishment of a working group to improve the quality of financial inclusion data is therefore most timely, and will benefit policymakers in making better and more informed policies, as well as tracking the outcome of policy initiatives. In addition, it may also serve to increase the visibility new issues areas which are currently not being given sufficient priority by policymakers. I would also like to encourage the working group to consider, in the longer term, the development of some form of a composite financial inclusion index. The composite index will 
BIS Review 88/2010 3 benefit everyone by providing a broad measure of trends, facilitate comparisons between distinct segments and create a benchmark for policy work in financial inclusion. It can eventually help to popularize the notion of financial inclusivity, and in that way help garner more global support for financial inclusion initiatives the world over. Finally, on behalf of Bank Negara Malaysia, I would like to thank the participants who have come here from many countries and institutions to contribute their ideas and knowledge to this workshop. I also would like to thank the Alliance for Financial Inclusion for their leadership and support in managing this initiative. I trust that the working group will be able to contribute towards the global agenda for a more inclusive financial system, and look forward to the fruits of your work in the months ahead. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 Philipp M Hildebrand: Europe’s fiscal challenges Speech by Mr Philipp M Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Annual General Meeting of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, Rüschlikon, Switzerland, 21 June 2010. *      *      * I would like to thank Rita Kobel Rohr for her valuable support in drafting this speech. I also want to thank Matthias Lutz for helpful comments. I want to thank the Swiss American Chamber of Commerce for the kind invitation. It is a privilege to speak to you this evening at your Annual General Meeting. The last time I was with you – it is now nearly two years ago –, I paid homage to Albert Gallatin, the legendary Swiss-American Secretary of the Treasury of the United States at the beginning of the 19th century. On that occasion, I chose to honour Gallatin because I felt he incorporates fundamental values long shared by Swiss and Americans alike. As it turns out, recent developments in Europe and elsewhere demonstrate compellingly that one of the important lessons of Gallatin’s outstanding career remains particularly relevant today. He teaches us that public debt reduction requires unwavering political commitment to fiscal discipline.  In my remarks this evening, I will attempt to put the fiscal challenges Europe is currently facing in a broader context. The handling of these challenges by Europe’s governments and its citizens will have implications for Switzerland, but also for the United States and ultimately for the world. In an attempt to understand what is currently happening in Europe, we have to go back to the 1950’s. European integration as we know it began 60 years ago, and until recently, it has been a success. The signing of the treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community on 18 April 1951 was the first genuine step towards economic and political integration. The six signatories – Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg –, agreed to run their coal and steel industries under a common management. The overriding goal was to secure a lasting peace on the European continent. The introduction of the Euro in 1999 was just one further – albeit major – step in this long-standing integration process. Throughout these decades, the world benefited from economic prosperity and peace on the European continent; a continent, that had previously been torn apart by two world wars within the span of forty years.  From a Swiss perspective, regardless of one’s political or ideological leanings, there can be no doubt that the Swiss economy situated at the very heart of Europe but remaining outside the European Union (EU) has benefited from the continued process of European integration. There are a host of examples to illustrate this.  The bilateral agreements Switzerland concluded with the EU in 1999 and 2004 would have been very difficult to reach with 27 individual nations. Among other things, this has led to greater immigration from the EU. Despite initial fears here in Switzerland, open and integrated labor markets between the EU and Switzerland have clearly given the Swiss economy a welcome boost in recent years. Indeed, private Swiss firms and even semi-public sectors like health care have reaped substantial benefits by drawing on the supply of large numbers of highly skilled immigrants from the EU member states and in particular from Germany. Moreover, this has not come at 
2 BIS Review 87/2010 the expense of Swiss workers. Recent research actually suggests that the immigration from the EU during the last couple of years has narrowed the wage differential.1 Immigrants have also been an important source of demand during the financial crisis. They are clearly one of the reasons why Switzerland’s economy has weathered the financial crisis relatively well. Indeed, Switzerland is one of the very few developed countries where private consumption remained a steady source of growth virtually throughout the entire financial crisis.2  A particularly relevant benefit directly linked to the introduction of the Euro pertains to exchange rate volatility. After the introduction of the Euro and before the peak of the financial crisis in 2008, the average Euro – Swiss franc volatility was roughly 30% lower than the prevailing Deutsche Mark – Swiss franc volatility in the 1990. The compression in exchange rate volatility is significantly larger if one takes the Lira or the Peseta or any of the other peripheral European currencies as a reference point. With the mounting concerns in financial markets over the ability of several, mainly peripheral European countries to handle their public debt level, the situation has evolved significantly. Exchange rate developments became a challenge for the Swiss National Bank (SNB). With interest rates at zero and limited means to further expand monetary policy through other quantitative easing channels, exchange rate interventions were a necessary unconventional monetary policy tool. The SNB made it clear that it would fight off “safe haven” flows out of the Euro in accordance with its objective to prevent deflationary risks from materializing by way of an excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc.  This strategy of fighting off deflation risks has yielded the intended results. The deflationary risk in Switzerland has largely disappeared and the Swiss economy has been able to benefit from the ongoing recovery of the global economy. While the weakening of the Euro with respect to the Swiss franc is dampening export activity, exports are being supported by growth in foreign demand. Overall, today the outlook for the Swiss economy remains a favourable one. Admittedly, the adopted strategy is not without risk which comes primarily in the form of increased currency and concentration risk in the SNB’s balance sheet. This risk reflects the burden the SNB has assumed in order to protect the Swiss economy from the threat of deflation. The SNB has sufficient equity capital to withstand even large losses. When considering the favourable economic outlook for Switzerland, we must not lose sight of the fact that the latest tensions on the financial markets have increased the downside risks. Should these downside risks materialise and, via an appreciation of the Swiss franc, lead to a renewed threat of deflation, the SNB would take all the measures necessary to ensure price stability. In other words, the SNB would do whatever it takes to fight deflation and safeguard price stability in the medium- and longer-term. Switzerland has an obvious and enormous interest in Europe’s ability to manage through this public debt crisis decisively and ultimately successfully. Europe’s ability to navigate out of the current crisis is also very much in the interest of the United States and indeed the world. When I say this, I don’t mean to refer solely to the potential economic strains as a result of Europe’s public debt concerns.  What is ultimately at stake is the vision of the founding fathers of the EU; the vision of a continent living in peace and prosperity and thereby contributing to a stable world order.                                                   1  See Gerfin, Michael and Boris Kaiser (2010), “Auswirkungen der Immigration der Jahre 2002 bis 2008 auf die Löhne in der Schweiz”, in: Die Volkswirtschaft, No. 6. 2  In 2009, annual growth of private consumption amounted to 1.2% in Switzerland, while in the euro area, it contracted by 1.2%. 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 Merely upholding this vision will not, however, resolve the debt situation. But it explains the bold and decisive steps taken by European governments, together with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to begin to address market concerns. It also explains why after a rapid deterioration of public finances in Europe, collective monitoring of fiscal discipline and peer pressure experience a revival. Arguably, more importantly, several countries have embarked on a path that entails much needed structural reforms. This public debt crisis is multi-layered. It is clearly a crisis of market confidence and as such a liquidity crisis. The trigger was a classic fiscal crisis combined with severe competitiveness problems in the periphery of the EU. However, it is also an institutional crisis. The institutional mechanism to ensure fiscal discipline inside the Eurosystem was clearly insufficient.  Obviously, part of the fiscal imbalances and the resulting build-up in public debt were directly related to the financial crisis and its aftermath. One part of the fiscal expansion can be explained by the direct fiscal effects of the measures taken to stabilize the financial system. Another part is explained by the drop in revenues and increases in social benefit payments in response to the post-crisis recession. According to recent IMF calculations, this accounts for about fifty percent of the increase in debt levels globally since the outbreak of the crisis. The other roughly fifty percent are unrelated to the financial crisis and its effects on the broader economy.3 To put it differently, some countries had simply lived beyond their means well before the financial crisis erupted in 2007. The reaction of financial markets is a wakeup call to all countries that sooner or later government finances must be put on a sustainable path. The main measures implemented so far at the EU level are mainly short-term oriented to fight of the liquidity crisis and associated contagion risks. A large assistance package has been established jointly by the EU and the IMF for Greece. To ward off the risk of contagion, the EU has put in place the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) while the IMF has committed to provide significant bilateral funding. Overall, the funding secured amounts to 750 bn Euros. This significant amount is justified by the high risk of international spillover effects. Additional support to ward off this contagion risk was given by the European Central Bank which decided to intervene in the euro area public and private debt market in order to restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism.4  These measures provide essential backstops. By adopting them, the governments of the EU member states and the European authorities have unequivocally stated their intention to safeguard the Euro. While this was a crucial first step, initial market reactions suggested persistent scepticism. The uncertainty regarding the health of the balance sheet of European banks is high and is keeping tensions on financial markets elevated. It is not only the exposure of European banks towards mainly peripheral EU countries that is a concern to market participants. Markets are also questioning the overall solidity of bank balance sheets in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Therefore, last Thursday the heads of governments of the EU member states agreed that the results of stress tests on their respective banks will be published in the second half of July. This decision can play an important role in fostering market confidence. In the event that these stress tests reveal cases where additional capital is necessary, recapitalization efforts will have to be undertaken swiftly. Institutional investors appear to be underweight in their exposure to European banks. This should prove helpful in lending support to potential capital raising efforts following a credible and transparent stress test exercise. Indeed, one of the reasons investors currently appear to underweight European banking stocks may very well                                                  3  See IMF (2010): World Economic Outlook, April, chapter 1, p. 9. 4  ECB press release, 10 May 2010. 
4 BIS Review 87/2010 be related to the fact that there is insufficient transparency about bank balance sheet conditions in Europe. Credible stress tests can remedy this problem. Contrary to what some commentators suggest, financial markets also look beyond the short-term. As a result, Europe’s authorities had to recognize that decisive and comprehensive longer-term fiscal programs are needed to put the EU as a whole on a sound fiscal basis.  Equally, individual countries can’t forever live beyond their means. Under pressure from the market, a number of countries have therefore initiated far reaching multi-year programs, which at least partly address structural problems.  Moreover, the way the EU as an institution deals with public finances will change. As many European officials have pointed out, in 2004, it was not Greece or Portugal but Germany  – together with France – that undermined fiscal discipline by successfully averting sanctions foreseen under the Stability and Growth Pact. Now, the EU and in particular the big countries are openly advocating measures to amend and significantly strengthen the institutional mechanism in order to enforce fiscal discipline.5  In this context, the member states of the EU are faced with a fundamental issue. The public debt crisis has shown that interdependence between member states of a monetary union is strong.6 Going forward in reforming the institutional set up of the EU, the core question is to what degree EU member states are ready to further relinquish sovereignty. How centralised or federal should the EU be? This discussion bears remarkable resemblance to the early years of the United States. At the time, an intense debate took place around the full assumption of the Revolutionary War debt of the states by the national government. The debate pitted the Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton against James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. While his opponents saw the assumption of the states’ debt by the national government as a threat to the republican government, Hamilton saw it as a unique opportunity to pursue his agenda of creating a more powerful national government. He considered assumption as a way to assure the new country a solid credit standing at home and abroad. This would allow the United States to take full advantage of the emerging global commercial and financial opportunities. In the end, Hamilton prevailed thanks to a classic political compromise involving the future permanent site of the capital of the United States.7  With history in mind, let me end on an optimistic note: As more details emerge about the EFSF and as the European authorities proceed with their stress tests, I am confident that market strains will begin to ease. While the EFSF provides a financial backstop, the importance of publishing credible bank stress test results cannot be overemphasized. I am convinced that meaningful transparency about the solidity of European banks and corresponding swift action to raise capital where necessary will bolster market confidence significantly. In a longer term perspective, credible steps are now being examined and will be undertaken to enhance fiscal discipline in the EU.

BIS Review 87/2010 5 states will have no choice but to take decisive steps to address the underlying institutional flaws that led to the current debt crisis in Europe. This is decisively not the first time the European integration process arrives at a crossroad. Since it began in earnest sixty years ago, many severe challenges had to be overcome to bring Europe to where it is today. As Jean Monnet, the pre-eminent founding father of the EU wrote in his memoirs in 1976:  “Europe will be forged in crises and it will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises”.8 I have no doubt that Europe’s authorities will once again rise to the occasion. They will ultimately adopt the necessary solutions to overcome the current public debt and confidence crisis. In doing so, they will safeguard the long-standing European integration process that has proven so valuable to Switzerland and to the rest of the world.                                                  8  See Monnet, Jean (1976): “Memoires”.  
BIS Review 87/2010 1 Erkki Liikanen: Some observations on today’s international financial situation on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Bank of Russia Remarks by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the Bank of Russia, Moscow, 18 June 2010. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to bring the greetings of the Bank of Finland to the 150th anniversary of the Bank of Russia. Our central banks are actually kind of relatives. Emperor Alexander II founded the Central Bank of the Russian Empire exactly 150 years ago. The Bank of Finland, for its part, was established by his uncle, Alexander I, in 1811. So it is clear that we have many common roots. I will return to these common roots in a moment, but let me first make some observations on today’s international financial situation.  * * * No country has escaped the effects of the current economic crisis. In many ways this was to be expected: The past decade witnessed unprecedented rise in the volumes of both international trade and financial flows. Not even during the first golden age of globalization, in the last decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th, were so many countries trading so much with each other. During the present, second era of globalization, many countries previously largely outside the international division of labour, have been able to enjoy the benefits of international trade and specialization.  The other side of the largely beneficial coin of globalization and interdependence is of course the higher vulnerability to other countries’ economic misfortunes. If a negative shock decreases demand in any large economy, the negative effects ripple through the world economy. In the current crisis, the sudden and very large disruption in the functioning of the global banking system made the problems even worse. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, one third of the volume of the world trade disappeared almost overnight. The increased integration of the world’s financial systems allowed the negative liquidity shock to spread extremely fast. Very few countries were immune.  While the global scope of the recent crisis is unique, in many ways this crisis has been very similar to the ones before it. It was preceded by an economic boom, accompanied by higher indebtedness, which increased vulnerabilities. Asset prices rose, including housing prices. When negative shocks occurred, expectations were revised downwards, and this caused asset prices to drop. Banks’ loan losses increased, and economic recession made the banks’ situation even more difficult. Loan losses reduced bank capital, which led to banking crises in many countries. Problems in the banking sector led to further problems in the real sector of the economy. Crises in the financial and real sectors have had adverse effects on public finances, as tax revenues have plummeted and public expenditures have risen. This means that in many cases financial and economic crises have been followed by crises of the public finances, as we are now seeing in Europe.  The nature of the crisis has reminded us of a basic fact, perhaps overlooked in the previous years. Liquidity is extremely important. This means that the tasks of the central banks as liquidity creators and providers have come into focus. This has happened everywhere, Russia included. For its part, the Bank of Russia acted quickly to ensure the liquidity of Russian banking sector, as did other central banks in their own economies. In fact, we have been reminded of some very old lessons in economic policy-making. Already in 1873 Walter Bagehot told us that central banks should lend freely to illiquid but solvent banks if they have adequate collateral to offer.  
2 BIS Review 87/2010 What are then the broader lessons for policy-makers? How should economic policy be designed in the new era of globalization? It is clear that even if countries have become dependent on each other, economic policies still matter. Moreover, national economic policies have international dimensions and international repercussions.  During the current, very difficult crisis, central banks have been able to ensure the functioning of the banking systems. For sure, there have been problems in many private financial institutions, and some of them have failed, but functioning of the whole financial systems has been preserved. Actually, successful liquidity policies have only been possible through broad international cooperation. If there is anything positive about this crisis, it is the proven capacity of central banks to act in cooperation with each other.  Fiscal policies have been loosened significantly, globally, and this has supported the level of overall demand although the private sector has turned to consolidating its balance sheets. The countries which entered the crisis with sound public finances have been in much better position. I am glad to note that during the upswing years, Russia was able to save for the rainy day through its Stabilization Fund and by paying off its debts. This has made reacting to the crisis much easier. Also in Finland, the pre-crisis years witnessed large public surpluses, which allowed the fiscal policy to be loosened when the crisis hit. However, in the coming years there is even greater need for responsible fiscal policies. And the benefits from fiscal responsibility are not limited to each country separately, but they are shared globally.  In designing future economic policies, we need to remember at least three things. First, we need mechanisms to prevent over-borrowing, both in the private and public sector. Second, risks need to be priced correctly. Too low risk premia will lead to over-borrowing. Last, resolving modern financial and economic crises demands international and regional cooperation. Achieving all this will require new approaches and new attitudes both in the public and private sector, and this will – of course – be hard. However, failure to achieve these goals would increase the risks of more crises in the future, and this is unacceptable.  * * * We are celebrating now the anniversary of one of the world’s great central banks, a bank with long traditions and a turbulent past. I think that this jubilee is especially significant for us Finns. This is so because the Russian and Finnish monetary systems share a lot of common history, in particular from the 19th century, when the Grand Duchy of Finland was established as a part of the Russian Empire.  1860, the birth-year of the Central Bank of Russia, was an important turning point also in the monetary history of Finland. In March 23, 1860 (old style), Emperor Alexander II issued a decree which gave Finland a monetary unit of its own, the Finnish markka. Before that, the Bank of Finland had issued banknotes denominated in rubles and kopecks. In June, at about the same time when the Central Bank of the Russian Empire was established, the first markka banknotes were circulated.  Both the Bank of Russia and the national monetary system of Finland were born as a result of a crisis which hit the rouble in the latter half of the 1850’s. In 1860, the Imperial Government of Finland sought ways to stabilize the currency with the aim of linking it with silver, even ahead of Russia, if necessary. This was the background to the creation of a national monetary unit for Finland. At the same time, the Russian government carried out a more comprehensive institutional reform by founding a new central bank to replace the old state banks. This was also made as a step towards a stable and market-based financial system. Circumstances are completely different now, of course, but one thing remains at least: financial and monetary stability are still the main objectives of today’s central bank policies, just as they were during the reforms of the 1860’s. We face challenges and even setbacks from time to time, but must still fulfil our responsibility in crisis management and work towards an even stronger and more resilient financial system in the future. This is not only a 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 national task, it is a global effort where good cooperation is a necessary condition for success. As circumstances change, the necessary tools may also change, but the ultimate goal remains the same. I congratulate the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on its anniversary and wish all success in its important tasks, in the service of this country, and as a partner in the international central banking community. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 Duvvuri Subbarao: Harnessing technology to bank the unbanked Remarks by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Banking Technology Excellence Awards 2009 at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT), Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, 18 June 2010. *      *      * 1. It is always a delight to be here in this wonderful city of Hyderabad. The location of IDRBT in Hyderabad is not an accident; it is a reflection of the growing reputation of Hyderabad as a premiere location for IT industry. Hailing as I do from this state, I know that we came from behind; twenty five years ago, there were several other cities ahead of Hyderabad on the technology scene; today, we are among the front runners. This remarkable reinvention of Hyderabad as an IT hub is a tribute to the brain-power and entrepreneurship of Andhra Pradesh. The location in Hyderabad of IDRBT, which has been spearheading the use of technology in banking, is a deliberate choice that has been informed by the synergies of the technology pool here.  Pioneering efforts of Andhra Pradesh 2. Andhra Pradesh has been in the forefront of financial inclusion efforts as well. The first grass root experiment towards financial inclusion based on technology, for direct transfer of government benefits to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts, started off a couple of years ago here in Andhra Pradesh in Warangal district. That small beginning has spun off a nation-wide campaign today for financial inclusion by harnessing technology for storing data on smart cards and for biometric identification of beneficiaries. That pioneering experiment has also triggered off several grass root experiments towards financial inclusion. It is, therefore, appropriate that we are recognizing innovations and achievements in the use of technology in banking in this pioneering state of Andhra Pradesh. Growing role of technology in banking 3. The transformation of the financial sector and the payment systems in this country over the last decade has been remarkable. No doubt, the brick and mortar infrastructure has expanded; the number of bank branches has multiplied ten fold – from 8000+ in 1969 when the first set of banks were nationalized to 80000+ today. But what has been even more striking has been the change in the manner of financial delivery. All of us present here will recall the agony we used to go through for outstation cheques to be realized and credited to our accounts. This used to take up to 45 days as the cheque had to physically travel across the country to the paying branch. There were even cases where the ultimate paying branch returned the cheque to the originating bank since it had been defaced by multiple postal stampings on its travel. Contrast that with the situation today. Outstation cheques normally get cleared in two days. And if people shift from paper to electronic modes, the transfer can be even faster. The RTGS allows funds transfer on a real time basis and the NEFT on a near real time basis. Keeping in view the safe, secure and efficient electronic payment modes now available, the Reserve Bank has also closed the system of high value cheque clearing.  4. In his recent book, “Building Social Business”, Muhammad Yunus notes that – in the sixties, no one predicted that internet would take the world by storm; that laptops, palm-tops, blackberrys, ipods, iphones, tablets and kindles would be in the hands of millions. Even twenty years ago, no one was predicting that mobile phones would become an integral part of life in every village of the world. Evidently, in 1990, we could not foresee the world of 2010; technology just outpaced our imagination. Similarly, in 2010, perhaps we are just unable to look ahead at 2030. In short, how technology is going to shape our world and our world 
2 BIS Review 87/2010 views is quite unpredictable. What is predictable though is that as newer technologies are ushered in, banking services will become more affordable and accessible. Note that the global financial crisis marked failure in several parts of the financial system; but the one segment that remained robust amidst failure all around was the payment and settlement system – the most technology intensive part of the financial system. Harnessing this power of technology for making our banking system more efficient, and for financial inclusion, is going to be a big opportunity and a bigger challenge for us. I want to focus my remarks today on this topic. Why is financial inclusion important? 5. Why is financial inclusion important? It is important simply because it is a necessary condition for generating and sustaining equitable growth. There are few, if any, instances of an economy transiting from an agrarian system to a post-industrial modern society without broad-based financial inclusion. As people having comfortable access to financial services, we all know from personal experience that economic opportunity is strongly intertwined with financial access. Such access is especially powerful for the poor as it provides them opportunities to build savings, make investments and avail credit. Importantly, access to financial services also helps the poor insure themselves against income shocks and equips them to meet emergencies such as illness, death in the family or loss of employment.  The size of financial exclusion 6. Yet the statistics on financial exclusion in India are disheartening. Out of the 600,000 habitations in the country, only about 30,000, or just 5 percent, have a commercial bank branch. Just about 40 per cent of the population across the country have bank accounts, and this ratio is much lower in the north-east of the country. The proportion of people having any kind of life insurance cover is as low as 10 per cent, and the proportion having non-life insurance is an abysmally low 0.6 per cent. People having debit cards comprise only 13 per cent and those having credit cards a marginal 2 per cent.  7. These statistics, staggering as they are, do not convey the true extent of financial exclusion. Even where bank accounts are claimed to have been opened, verification has shown that a significant portion of these accounts are dormant. Very few conduct any banking transactions and even fewer receive any credit. Millions of people across the country are thereby denied the opportunity to harness their earning capacity and entrepreneurial talent, and are condemned to marginalization and poverty. 8. But there is a brighter side to the story. Remember that illustration they give in business strategy courses. A business executive of a shoe company was sent to a large developing country to assess the market potential there. What he saw was millions of people going without shoes. He came back and reported to the management that there was no business potential there because no one wore shoes. A few months later, the strategist of a rival company went and saw the same picture. He came back and reported to his management that there is tremendous business potential in that country because of the number of shoes they can sell. Ultimately, it is a question of mindset, and it is only the change in mindset of all concerned stakeholders that can make financial inclusion a reality.  Is financial inclusion a viable business model? 9. How can we make financial inclusion workable? Contrary to common perception, financial inclusion is a potentially viable business proposition. Take the success story of Dharavi, a bustling industrial-slum in Mumbai. Wikipedia reports that Dharavi exports goods worth $500 – $650 million every year. Ironically, even though Dharavi is situated right in the heart of Mumbai, the most banked city in the country, and adjoins the Bandra-Kurla 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 Complex, Mumbai’s financial district, it did not have a commercial bank branch for a long time, notwithstanding its celebrated entrepreneurial spirit and export performance. The first commercial bank branch was opened in February 2007. In just three years, the bank registered business in excess of Rs. 44 crore. Enthused by this success, one more bank has opened a branch in Dharavi and many more are eager to do so. There are now 9 ATMs in Dharavi, all of them being actively used. How does the other half live? 10. The reality is that money management is a well-understood part of everyday life of the poor, and therefore a key factor in determining their coping strategies. Some of you may have come across this recent, thought provoking book, “Portfolios of the Poor: How the World’s Poor Live on $2 a Day” by Daryl Collins et al. Most books on poverty and development, as we know, are “big picture” books that tend to take an aggregate view based on anecdotal evidence or at best statistical work. This book strikes a refreshingly distinct path. What the authors have done is to zoom in on the basics of daily poverty to explore how poor people manage their money. Let me cite a paragraph from the review of the book in the New Yorker: Ten years ago, the authors of this unusual study began collecting detailed yearlong “financial diaries” from households in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa, with a focus on those living on less than two dollars a day per person. They found, to their surprise, that none of the families lived hand to mouth; even the poorest relied on complex combinations of financial strategies, including joining savings clubs, buying funeral insurance, and acting as “money guards” for neighbors. These people did things that might seem irrational – borrowing in order to save; paying interest on savings – but that made sense given their unpredictable incomes and limited options.  11. The Dharavi example that I cited earlier is an illustration of how banking the unbanked can be a win-win opportunity. This book is further evidence of the sophistication with which poor people think about their finances. It also demonstrates how bringing them within the fold of formal banking can “make a difference” to their coping strategies. Financial inclusion – efforts so far 12. In order to further financial inclusion, the Government and the Reserve Bank are pursuing several initiatives. Let me recount some of them briefly. 13. First, to improve banking penetration in the north-east, Reserve Bank has asked State Governments and banks to identify centres where there is need for setting up branches that are full-fledged, offer forex facilities, handle government business and meet currency needs. RBI will then fund the capital and running costs for five years, provided the State Government concerned is willing to make available the premises and put in place appropriate security arrangements.  14. Second, Government of India has set-up two funds – the Financial Inclusion Fund for meeting the costs of developmental and promotional interventions towards financial inclusion, and the Financial Inclusion Technology Fund for meeting the costs of technology adoption. Each of these funds has an overall corpus of Rs. 500 crore. 15. Third, the Finance Minister announced in his latest budget that every village in the country with over 2000 population must have access to banking services by March 2012. Even as the brick and mortar branch presence will expand, the big driver going forward will be branchless banking based on the business correspondent (BC) model and leveraging on technology. In order to facilitate this, the Reserve Bank has also enlarged the types of entities that can be engaged as BCs.  
4 BIS Review 87/2010 16. We are all aware of Aadhar (‚¸š¸¸£), the Unique Identification Number (UID) Project of Government of India, headed by Nandan Nilekani. Although the main aim of UID is to provide a unique ID number for everyone in the country, Aadhar (‚¸š¸¸£) will be a powerful instrumentality for helping the poor establish their identity to meet the banks’ KYC norms. This will reduce cash and non-cash transaction costs both to the banks and to the potential customers. The UID is another powerful illustration of harnessing technology for the benefit of the poor. 17. Fourth, we have asked every domestic commercial bank – public and private sector – to prepare its own Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) and have it approved by its Board. Our aim in this respect is two fold. First, each bank should have ownership of its FIP. Second, we want each bank to build on its comparative advantage. We want banks to be innovative and entrepreneurial and try out their own models and experiments consistent with their business models.  18. The FIPs are meant to be rolled out over the next three years and are required to include indicators for performance evaluation. RBI has held meetings with the chairmen of banks to review the FIPs prepared by them. These meetings, chaired by Deputy Governor Dr. Chakrabarty, have enabled a clearer understanding of issues in financial inclusion. The discussions revealed that the main challenge is to ensure that the no-frill accounts actually become operational. Because of dire poverty, the account or the branch services are rarely or minimally used. Banks agreed that, for the FIPs to succeed:  scalable technology solutions should be in place;  the RRBs should also be core-banking enabled;  business correspondent model coupled with biometric technology needs to be deployed;   performance criteria of staff should include achievement of financial inclusion targets; and   connectivity issues need to be sorted out by service providers.  Role of technology 19. Let me now revert to the role and importance of technology for financial inclusion. Financial inclusion efforts to date have been driven through two distinct channels: smart cards and mobile phones. One issue that often comes for debate in this regard is the need to ensure interoperability of technological solutions. I am told that efforts are afoot to achieve this. It is, however, important not to miss the wood for the trees. The priority clearly has to be to facilitate “inclusion” first. “Interoperability” is no doubt important but it can follow. Clearly inclusion cannot wait for interoperability to happen.  20. The second issue relates to the choice of a model for mobile banking. World over, there are two distinct models – the “bank-led” model and the “mobile operator-led” model. The Reserve Bank has a clear preference for the bank-led model. This is so for at least two important reasons. First, we want our financial inclusion to be more than just a remittance facility; we want our customers to get minimum services like deposit insurance, access to affordable credit and the payment system which only banks can offer. Second, given the growing concerns about money laundering and financing of terrorism, a bank led model is decidedly safer and more sustainable. We do recognize that mobile telephony has an important role in the value chain and we are keen that mobile service providers collaborate with banks to provide value added services.  
BIS Review 87/2010 5 Technology in banking – the way forward 21. Let me now look ahead and flag a few important issues in the use of technology in banking and how it can be an aid to value creation.  22. The deepening of the use of technology in banking requires that it be accompanied by good “IT governance” which is a sub-set of good corporate governance. Banks must put in place robust risk management systems encompassing effective infrastructure, security policies, incident reporting and business continuity management. Also, these management systems must be subject to regular review and monitoring. Needless to say, as businesses expand, the risk from a failure in IT systems expands disproportionately faster, reinforcing the need for good IT governance. There have been instances where some banks could not participate for more than a day in the NEFT/RTGS product offerings for several reasons – problems in the internet channel interface going unnoticed, data clean-up in the database not getting adequate attention, ignoring hardware sizing aspects, delaying the decision to move to the back-up site, and the like. Greater management attention can easily fix these flaws. That is why IT governance is important.  23. The second priority issue on the way forward is the quality control of data and its use for improving banking efficiency. The hierarchy of transition is from data to information to knowledge to wisdom. Technology enables banks to collect voluminous data pertaining to customers and transactions. As most bank branches, including those of RRBs, are coming under the core banking platform, it is important not to be swamped by this deluge but to process the data into useful information for management through robust MIS and decision support systems. This becomes particularly relevant in the context of internal rating models and fraud detection techniques where extraction of patterns from data is the sine-qua-non. The Reserve Bank attaches a lot of importance to ensuring the quality of data, its processing into useful information and the flow of that information to the appropriate level. To streamline this, the Reserve Bank has formed a group comprising experts from banks, IDRBT, IBA and RBI to study the information reporting system of banks and to suggest an approach for automated data flow in a straight-through manner from the source systems of banks to the Reserve Bank.  24. The next priority issue on my list is protection of information and customer confidentiality. There are growing concerns about the increase in cyber crimes, phishing related frauds, identify frauds and misuse of customer information and the like. Threats from skimming, sniffing, spamming, spoofing, etc., are all increasing. Some of you may be aware of recent instances of several people getting defrauded through the so called prize winning schemes where names of prominent institutions are being used to lure remittances of large amounts of money by promising millions in return. I am informed that these monies are often being paid into banks’ accounts by gullible people and then siphoned out. Even if such accounts are opened after following KYC norms, the unusual pattern of these transactions can be easily discerned if banks use appropriate technologies for this purpose. It is in this context that in our Monetary Policy Statement for 2010–11, we proposed setting up a working group on information security, electronic banking, technology risk management, and tackling cyber frauds. 25. Next on my list is the several ways IT models can be used to improve the efficiency of banking – for example, for credit appraisal using the score card model, for determination of provisioning to be made against loans and for handling millions of low value accounts without compromising on underwriting and supervisory standards. 26. Last, and possibly the most important on my list of priority issues is the need to guard against what can be called a “technology barrier” between the bank and the customer. As we all recognize, technology is a great enabler and provides us huge opportunities for making banking more efficient and more inclusive. At the same time, it is also faceless, and this absence of a “human touch” can be quite intimidating, if not threatening, to those just entering the banking network. Banks should, therefore, take extra care to ensure that the 
6 BIS Review 87/2010 poor are not driven away from banking because the technology interface is unfriendly. This requires training the banks’ frontline staff and managers as well as business correspondents on the human side of banking.  IDRBT as facilitator 27. Before I close, I will be amiss if I do not acknowledge the impressive contribution of IDRBT to “techno-banking”, if I may use such a phrase now. IDRBT’s initiatives in developing the INFINET, its contribution to the establishment of a messaging platform (SFMS) and a shared ATM-network (NFS) have added immense value to our banking sector. IDRBT’s performance as a certification authority, as an R&D centre and as an institution for training and education have marked great advances in the Indian financial sector.  28. The Rangarajan Committee which had gone into the issue of repositioning IDRBT for the next decade has since made valuable recommendations. These relate to:  need for thrust on research and development activities with a clear focus on the areas of research that should be taken up in the next 3 to 5 years time;   revamping education and training activities with the aim to develop technically competent and in-house expertise in banks to efficiently supervise and manage technology-intensive resources like data centres, data recovery centres, corporate network, etc.;   becoming a member of global technology standard setting bodies active in the area of banking; and   developing a cadre of faculty focussing on technology requirements of the banking industry.  29. We are working on implementing these recommendations. 30. As I noted earlier, Indian banks have come a long way in using technology to improve the reach and efficiency of banking. What they have done is laudable because they have adapted the best international technology practices to the Indian situation. I want to compliment them for what they have achieved and for their efforts towards addressing the challenges on the way forward.  Task for IDRBT 31. We are gathered here today to recognize outstanding performance in the use of technology in banking. Hearty congratulations to the winners today. I hope these awards will encourage further innovations and competition towards improving efficiency. I also wonder if we can benchmark banks’ performance in the use and adoption of technology against some international standards, especially in the area of financial inclusion. I would urge IDRBT to work on this.  32. Finally, I want to compliment Shri Sambamurthy and his dedicated team of faculty and staff at IDRBT for their important contributions to the financial sector. My thanks also to the members of the Governing Council of the Institute whose expertise and guidance has been the backbone of IDRBT’s performance and achievements. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 Muhammad bin Ibrahim: Evolving the next frontier of Islamic finance development through innovation Speech by Mr Muhammad bin Ibrahim, Assistant Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the Mock Cheque Exchange Ceremony between the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) and Bank Islam, Maybank Islamic and Affin Islamic, Kuala Lumpur, 15 June 2010. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to witness the mock cheque exchange ceremony for the allocation of zakat contributions from Bank Islam, Maybank Islamic and Affin Islamic to the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF). This act of giving signifies an exemplary commitment on the part of these Islamic financial institutions to support human capital development in Islamic finance. As a leading provider of advanced education in Islamic finance, INCEIF plays an important role to position Malaysia as a center for innovation and thought leadership in this field. But INCEIF alone would not be able to achieve this objective without the continuous efforts and support by all stakeholders within the industry. Let me make a few remarks on innovation. Few would argue on the role of innovation as the connerstone to sustaining growth and securing competitive advantage for any organization, industry, economy and nation. As we have seen in the more recent decades, innovation has fundamentally transformed the global financial landscape at a very rapid pace. Innovation in the financial services industry has enabled financial institutions to obtain better insight into customer needs and correspondingly, develop new and better products to match their diverse needs, make significant improvements in operational efficiency by improving processes and business models as well as ensure more effective risk management. It has facilitated greater financial inclusion by allowing broader access to financial services in many emerging and developing countries. But the abilities to innovate will very much depend on the ability to get the necessary talent: the creativity to develop new ideas, the capacity to absorb knowledge and the capacity to acquire the new skill to turn ideas into results. This requires a talented workforce as the driving force of innovation. Building such a workforce would thus become a constant challenge for the Islamic financial services industry.  In the context of Islamic finance, human capital development is all the more important given that the Islamic finance industry is still relatively in a nascent development phase. There is no doubt that the Islamic financial services industry in Malaysia has experienced an exciting and phenomenal growth. The proliferation of competitively priced Islamic financial products to match the diverse and discerning needs of customers particularly in this recent decade is quite evident. But we cannot be complacent. What has served us well in the past is unlikely to serve us well into the future.  We must be mindful that being innovative in this environment of constant change and heightened complexity in itself is a challenge. Along with technological advancements which bring about more efficient ways of conducting financial services, globalisation and liberalization of markets are amongst today’s major forces of change that are transforming the global financial landscape, blurring the geographical borders in doing business and increasing competition in the financial sector. Moreover, the recent global financial crisis has brought about several important developments that are shaping the global financial landscape. One that is relevant is the increasing awareness and appreciation amongst the international financial community on the distinct nature and inbuilt strengths of Islamic finance. The crisis thus has provided an opportunity for Islamic finance to strategically position itself as a stable form of financial intermediation. A few challenges stood before us  – ongoing global reform that is going to change the contour of financial regulation, challenges associated with a general public distrust on the financial sector, general suspicion on 
2 BIS Review 87/2010 financial innovation, and constant competition from other financial centers aspiring to take advantage of opportunities in Islamic finance as a new area of growth.  Against these developments, we need to rise above these challenges whilst transitioning into the next level of its development. This will require rethinking of existing product structures and formulating new ones. New products being developed must also be competitive, meet the greater sophistication of customers’ needs and distinct from financial solutions offered by conventional banks.  As new players enter the industry, the competition for the best talent would become more intense. Demand will increase for talents in the Islamic financial services industry who are not only conversant in both fields of finance and Shariah but must also possess soft skills such as managerial expertise, leadership and effective communication. Thus education and learning providers must constantly relook at the methodology of teaching, learning contents and the contemporary skills requirements of the industry. Forging greater collaboration between industry and academia is also an important aspect to align the training and development and the business requirements of the industry. We should all be mindful about the employability of our graduates.  The industry-academia partnership could come in various forms. For example, there could be more reciprocal dialogues and strategic alliances to explore areas with the aim to provide real solutions to contemporary issues that are key to progressive development of the Islamic financial services industry. We should capitalize on our extensive experience in industry development which makes Malaysia a fertile learning ground on Islamic finance. For example, our Islamic financial market is vibrant and progressive, whilst our Islamic financial institutions are innovative and dynamic. Islamic financial institutions could complement INCEIF’s education programmes by offering practical training at their organization. The opportunity for an attachment at our institutions is an added value to INCEIF’s programmes, and an attractive value proposition for foreign students. On this note, the strong industry support has indeed been commendable and contributed to the progress of INCEIF. Efforts by INCEIF to forge strategic alliances with entities from all over the world must also continue. Today’s allocation of zakat contribution to INCEIF by the three Islamic banks is another commendable act of industry in support of learning. INCEIF has received monetary contributions from several other Islamic financial institutions since 2007. This has enabled INCEIF to continuously enhance its internal capacity as the leading provider of Islamic finance education and knowledge. The contributions are being utilized to create the provision of scholarships, research and facilities development. In this regard, INCEIF has recently been accorded the “Project of National Interest” (Projek Berkepentingan Nasional) status. This status, which accords contributors with tax benefits in the forms of tax rebates for zakat contributions and tax deductions for non-zakat contributions, will incentivize more individuals and institutions in providing monetary support to INCEIF. The contributions will indeed go a long way towards the growth and development of Islamic finance in Malaysia and beyond.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: Presentation of the Annual Report 2009 Address by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to the Governing Council of the Bank of Spain on the Presentation of the Annual Report 2009, Madrid, 16 June 2010. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  The presentation of the Annual Report for 2009 is taking place at a particularly complex juncture for Europe and, most especially, for the Spanish economy. What began as an isolated ﬁscal crisis episode in a euro area Member State has turned into an event of systemic scope that has obliged the European authorities and national governments to adopt measures on an unprecedented scale to defend the stability of the area.  At the same time, the spread and heightening of tensions have ﬁrmly focused analysts’ and markets’ attention on the situation and on economic policy responses in those countries which, like Spain, face comparatively more demanding challenges and are, consequently, perceived as potentially more vulnerable.  This is a demanding conjunctural situation, for which it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd points of reference in our recent past. And more than ever before, it is important to diagnose accurately the true scale of the challenges our economy faces, to prepare promptly the tools needed to meet the challenges and to use them as decisively and forcefully as the situation requires. We must, moreover, act with the urgency demanded by our responsibilities as active members of the common European project in defence of stability and the success of this project. The report I present today is speciﬁcally geared to contribute to this task.  From spring last year, the economic indicators offered signs that the world economy was emerging from the most critical phase of the gravest real and ﬁnancial crisis since the Great Depression. Progress since along the path to recovery has been much more evident in the emerging economies, for which the latest projections indicate growth rates above 6% for 2010. By contrast, the developed countries’ economies are recovering at a considerably less dynamic rate, of around 2%.  This turnaround conﬁrms that the rapid and energetic economic policy action to support ﬁnancial systems, to stimulate demand and to sustain conﬁdence was pivotal in halting a spiral of recession and ﬁnancial instability which, had it continued, would have undoubtedly had disastrous consequences for the world economy.  Halting this recessionary spiral was crucial for placing the world economy once again on a path of sustained output and employment growth. But if the incipient recovery – still subject to considerable uncertainty and risks – is to take root, further measures on various fronts will be needed.  The bulk of the measures adopted to check the accelerated economic and ﬁnancial downturn were exceptional. Accordingly, they have to be withdrawn. The proper timing of the withdrawal of these impulses that have sought to progressively restore economies’ capacity to generate growth autonomously is a challenge of the ﬁrst order for national economic policy management. And the challenge is heightened by the adverse effects that the crisis has had on economies’ growth potential, which will call for measures and structural reforms that enable such potential to be restored and increased.  Complicating matters, moreover, is the pressing need to tackle the effects that the sharp economic contraction and the emergency measures applied have had on public ﬁnances. This means ambitious and credible ﬁscal consolidation processes will have to be set in train which, while needed to prevent an unprecedented and practically irreversible deterioration in public ﬁnances, will tend to slow recovery.  
2 BIS Review 86/2010 Unfortunately, the sequence which begins with a ﬁnancial crisis evolving into a real crisis and ultimately prompting a ﬁscal crisis is a fairly common and recurrent pattern of behaviour in past crises. Tensions like those witnessed in recent months on European sovereign debt markets in the wake of doubts over the sustainability of Greek public ﬁnances are sufﬁciently illustrative of the scale of the risks that may arise from such a sequence.  In particular, the euro area had to face a crisis of unexpected proportions. As in other regions, this meant large-scale emergency solutions had to be activated to check the downturn in the economy and curb expectations of a deepening of the recession and an outbreak of ﬁnancial instability. The euro area is over the worst phase of the recession, but if ambitious supply-side policies are not pursued, recovery will prove particularly slow. All that has been said on the need to revitalise potential growth through structural reforms and to prevent a ﬁscal crisis through credible ﬁscal consolidation programmes is a particularly pressing concern for the euro area.  The emergence of the fateful “ﬁnancial crisis-real crisis-ﬁscal crisis” sequence in one of the Member States, namely Greece, is a particularly serious and important development. Its effects have spread not only to other countries but also to the euro area as a whole, thus turning it into a new epicentre of global ﬁnancial instability. This episode has highlighted the weakness of the economic governance arrangements for the euro, and is forcing some of its working mechanisms to be reconsidered, with a view to setting sounder foundations in place.  Events triggered by the Greek ﬁscal crisis have ultimately exacerbated signiﬁcantly the complex framework in which the Spanish economy operates. Allow me to depart from the traditional structure of this address to tackle the important issues raised by the Greek crisis in terms of the consequences for the Spanish economy in this exceptional situation, which poses a welter of challenges to Spain’s medium- and long-term growth possibilities.  The shockwave of the Greek ﬁscal crisis hit the Spanish economy when we were facing the consequences of the deterioration in the labour market and in public ﬁnances and the need to complete the banking restructuring process under way. To understand the implications, the starting point must be a sufﬁciently broad-sighted diagnosis of the current situation of the Spanish economy.  An idea central to the Annual Report I present to you today is that exiting the recession in Spain involves the need to absorb and overcome the imbalances that built up during the long expansionary phase. That is a prerequisite if the new growth path is to be underpinned by a model capable of generating employment and by a more efﬁcient use of productive resources than in the past. This process can only be successful if economic policies adopt an active and ambitious role removing the obstacles that have emerged and restoring conﬁdence in the Spanish economy’s capacity to negotiate this critical juncture. This message, which I have attempted to convey in recent years, is now a matter of the utmost urgency. Indeed, the government’s latest ﬁscal, labour market and pensions measures are in keeping with this urgency.  Let me begin by summarising those aspects of the recession in Spain that are key to understanding the scale of the challenges we face. In 2009, there was an abrupt decline in Spanish economic activity, the biggest in recent decades. Furthering the fall in activity that had begun in the second half of 2008, this placed the level of GDP in the opening months of 2010 at 4.6% below its peak in the second quarter of 2008.  On the basis of this ﬁgure, the scale of the recession in Spain appears to have been in line with global trends. However, taking into consideration the magnitude of the decline in domestic spending (8% over the same period), the intensity of job destruction (over 2 million jobs lost since employment was at a peak) and the rise in the numbers unemployed (over 4.5 million at the start of this year), it is clear there are singular factors involved in the contraction in Spain. These mirror the major imbalances built up during the expansionary phase – in particular, the excessive concentration of resources in the real estate sector and 
BIS Review 86/2010 3 high private-sector debt – and the persistence of serious structural deﬁciencies in the functioning of the labour market.  This series of factors has prompted a reduction in household spending, driven by the slowdown in income and the losses in wealth accumulated since the start of the crisis, and furthered by the deterioration in conﬁdence and in expectations of future income, the tightening of lending standards and households’ perception of the need to restore health to their ﬁnancial position. That explains the rapid increase in the household saving rate, which reached an alltime high in 2009 of close to 19%.  The fall-off in household spending compounded the contraction in external demand and the highly adverse conditions for business investment, namely high uncertainty, a rise in the cost and availability of ﬁnancing, and falling proﬁts. The upshot was an unprecedented reduction in investment, with signiﬁcant effects on the economy’s level of capitalisation.  Nonetheless, in late 2009 and early 2010 there was some improvement, especially in household consumption, which began to respond to the major stimulus packages adopted. The slight rise in consumption combined with the positive contribution of the external sector enabled Spain to join in the recovery already under way in other developed countries. The signs of recovery are still very muted and are largely sustained by temporary factors that will tend to peter out in the coming months. The recovery will foreseeably be gradual and take some time to gather the momentum sufﬁcient to generate employment.  Accompanying the incipient stabilisation of the economy are certain developments which, while they may be interpreted as the counterpoint of the contraction in domestic demand, contribute to creating conditions conducive to a return to growth. The sharp fall in domestic spending has contributed signiﬁcantly to altering the dynamics of inﬂation, the pace of which has clearly slowed to the extent of posting negative differentials with the euro area for most of last year, something unprecedented since the start of EMU. The disinﬂationary process has continued in 2010 to date, and there have even been falls in core inﬂation in a setting in which the slowdown in services prices has continued to intensify. It is too early yet to know to what extent this development is in response to a greater sensitivity of cost and price-setting to cyclical conditions. But this would be a signiﬁcant step towards improving the competitive foundations of the Spanish economy, a vital ingredient for any sustained recovery scenario. This is why it is essential to see through the liberalisation processes under way in the sector further to recent legislative initiatives and, in particular, to the transposition of the Community Directive on services.  Diminished domestic demand has also exerted an inﬂuence on the reduction in the external deﬁcit, on a scale difﬁcult to imagine only two years back. As explained in the Annual Report, this correction is largely due to the reduction in the trade deﬁcit as imports ground to a halt and, from this standpoint, it appears to be chieﬂy attributable to cyclical factors. It should be stressed, however, that goods exports have shown a strong capacity for recovery in recent months, as has trade in services. Both developments are promising and need to ﬁrm in the future if the nation’s net borrowing is to be permanently reduced and if growth is to pivot on an export sector that is stronger and less reliant on imports.  Despite this progress, substantial adjustments have still to be made, and as promptly as possible, if they are not to act as a drag on the recovery. I refer in particular to the need to complete the absorption of excess capacity in the residential construction sector, to continue the ﬁnancial restructuring of the private sector and to improve the Spanish economy’s competitive position. And this must be done in tandem with tackling the problems that have arisen as the economic crisis has unfolded: the decline in employment and the deterioration of public ﬁnances.  The severity of job destruction has been due to the persistence of serious structural deﬁciencies in the labour market that were not corrected during the previous upturn, amid far-reaching changes in demographics and in the composition of labour supply. As explained in detail in the 2009 Annual Report, these shortcomings have meant that the labour market 
4 BIS Review 86/2010 adjustment has fallen disproportionately on employment. This is a result, above all, of the prevalence of collective bargaining at the industry or territorial level which, naturally, is not sufﬁciently tailored to the different environments that different companies face. An institutional characteristic such as this is particularly harmful in a situation like that the Spanish economy has undergone in the past two years, in which the crisis has very unevenly impacted ﬁrms and industries. Indeed, the crisis has ultimately driven a large number of companies and workers out of the market, causing lasting damage to productive capacity and human capital. The bargaining system tends to aggravate cyclical oscillations and contractionary spending trends, and it is not consistent with harmonious integration into the euro area.  The events of recent months have highlighted the problems posed, as regards exiting the crisis, by the rapid ﬁscal deterioration which took place during the recession and which was exacerbated by the contagion of the Greek ﬁscal credibility crisis to other potentially vulnerable economies, including Spain.  To put the scale of this challenge in context, I shall review the factors which led the Spanish general government deﬁcit to a level of 11.2% of GDP, from a surplus position of 1.9% of GDP two years earlier, and which increased the public debt ratio by around 17 pp of GDP over this same period.  An initial factor, while not the most important one, is that stemming from the economic contraction which accelerated expenditure on unemployment beneﬁts and on other items linked to the cycle, and dented tax bases, causing a sharp reduction in revenue from certain taxes linked to labour and corporate activity and to spending. Adding to this was the impact of the exceptional support measures adopted by the government in the face of the depth of the recession, in line with agreed global action, and which in our country exceeded those in other developed countries. But what proved of great importance was the loss of tax revenue as a consequence of the sharp adjustment in the real estate sector and which, unfortunately, has a very high permanent component. All these developments combined with a rising trajectory of public spending systematically higher than that of the economy’s trend growth.  Accordingly, much of the burgeoning ﬁscal deﬁcit that emerged during the crisis is eminently structural. And correcting this means the unavoidable adoption of a far-reaching budgetary consolidation process that bears down precisely on the most permanent and inertial components of public spending. This process is all the more urgent given the seriousness of the repercussions of the Greek ﬁscal crisis and the pressing need to halt the deterioration in the perception of Spanish public ﬁnances.  Indeed, the worsening of the ﬁscal crisis in Greece has substantially altered the conditions governing the design and execution of a ﬁscal consolidation programme. Systematic and substantive non-compliance with the commitments acquired by the Greek authorities in respect of public ﬁnances, added to a repeated lack of informative transparency, resulted in a strong loss of conﬁdence by the markets in the Greek government’s capacity to meet its payment commitments. That gave rise to a completely new situation and, what has ﬁnally proved most telling, one not foreseen in the institutional arrangements underpinning the euro area: the perception of a potential risk of insolvency of one of its members.  This lack of foresight translated into difﬁculties in promptly setting up a sufﬁciently forceful institutional response. These difﬁculties were clearly identiﬁed by the markets and meant that the speciﬁc risk of insolvency of a Member State rapidly turned into a systemic risk for the whole of the area.  Evidently, the spread of ﬁscal difﬁculties in one speciﬁc country to other Member States can run through many channels, which may include the exposure of ﬁnancial institutions to sovereign debt, the correlation between risk premia on markets and the effects associated with changes in trade ﬂows. The importance of these mechanisms is unquestionable. But the speed at which tensions have spread in this case and their initial and sharp impact on those Member States whose public ﬁnances have most deteriorated suggest that the weaknesses 
BIS Review 86/2010 5 perceived in the institutional arrangements for governance of the euro area may have played a central role.  As has been brought home to us in these months, the rapid spread of tensions has meant difﬁcult and far-reaching decisions have had to be adopted on two fronts: the common European front and the domestic front of each Member State.  On the European front, the Heads of State and of Government and the Ecoﬁn outlined a powerful programme of ﬁnancial support for the Greek authorities. Implementation of the programme was conditional upon Greek economic policies being redressed with regard to their ﬁscal consolidation strategy, which had to be strengthened and accelerated, and to the need to undertake ambitious structural reforms to move back onto a path of sustained growth.  Subsequently, the agreement to create a European stabilisation mechanism strengthened this ﬁrm commitment of the Member States to maintaining the stability of the euro area. Although the details of this programme are still being worked out, the volume of the funds involved, which including the IMF contribution could amount to as much as €750 billion, seems sufﬁciently illustrative of the determination of governments to defend the common European project. Naturally, as in the case of the initial support package for Greece, the possible ﬁnancial support will always be subject to a strict principle of conditionality, as an indispensable factor to ensure that the underlying problems are addressed with sufﬁcient ambition and determination, and to avoid possible situations of moral hazard which could degenerate into the accumulation of new risks for the future.  The European Commission and the European Central Bank have also contributed decisively to this task of strengthening the common pillars of the area. In this respect important steps have been taken to establish a sounder framework of policies to preserve the smooth functioning of the euro area. I refer in particular to the Commission’s recent proposals to strengthen in various ways the Stability and Growth Pact and to extend the areas of mutual oversight and consultation within the EU. The ultimate aim of these proposals is the early detection and redressing of those imbalances which, as has become clear to us in these last few months, will put the stability of the euro area at risk if allowed to continue and accumulate.  In this respect, the European Central Bank has also reacted to the emergency situation. It has done this by adjusting its schedule for withdrawing the extraordinary crisis-combating measures put in place, so as to attune it to developing ﬁnancial market tensions. It thus  re-established its six-month liquidity-providing operations, resumed its ﬁxed-rate full-allotment tender system for three-month tenders and recommenced dollar-denominated liquidity-providing operations.  Furthermore, the ECB started up a public and private asset purchase programme with a view to remedying the dysfunctions in certain ﬁnancial market segments which were endangering the normal operation of the monetary policy transmission mechanism that is essential to ensure price stability.  Along with these actions on the common European front, the other essential component of the response to the emergency situation is the reaction of national governments to ensure the sustainability of their ﬁnances and to undertake the reforms needed to restore vigorous and stable growth of both output and employment.  In this regard, the sequence and content of the ﬁscal consolidation packages adopted by the Spanish government have naturally been inﬂuenced by recent developments. The Spanish government took a ﬁrst step towards ﬁscal consolidation when it deﬁned the State budget for 2010 and, later, when it presented the Updated Stability Programme in January this year, following the recommendations of the ECOFIN. In this programme it committed to reducing the budget deﬁcit to 3% of GDP by 2013, by means of sharp cuts in public spending, although the programme was based on a relatively benign macroeconomic scenario, thereby 
6 BIS Review 86/2010 raising the question of the need for additional efforts should budget deviations arise, an eventuality expressed by the ECOFIN Council in its recommendation on the programme.  The scale of the ﬁscal crisis in Greece has led the Spanish government to strengthen and accelerate its ﬁscal consolidation programme in order to prevent market deterioration and the attendant serious consequences for the economy and the stability of the euro area. The package of measures approved on 20 May brings forward a signiﬁcant portion of the effort to be made to reduce the deﬁcit in 2011, when it should stand at 6% of GDP, and acts directly on its structural component, which is projected to fall by somewhat more than half with respect to the estimated 2009 levels.  The government’s unprecedented austerity drive reﬂects the exceptional nature of the situation and the resolve to set public ﬁnances on the right track and thereby dispel the doubts which were fomenting contagion and instability. The unquestionable costs this will entail for society will be compensated by the enhanced protection from instability and by a sounder position on which to base recovery.  It is thus absolutely essential to meet the new targets set, even if the macroeconomic scenario ultimately proves to be less dynamic than envisaged by the government. In the current circumstances any deviation from projections could have serious consequences for the credibility of the ﬁscal consolidation efforts. To ensure strict compliance with targets, monitoring and supervision procedures will have to be strengthened and contingency plans designed to ensure that targets are met and certain expenditure items are behaving adequately. The cooperation of local and regional governments is essential if the ambitious process of ﬁscal consolidation facing us is to be tackled successfully.  The ﬁscal effort to be made by the Spanish economy, in a situation in which the available projections point to moderate growth, is considerable, and may become even more so if nothing is done to correct the upward path of interest rates triggered by the Greek ﬁscal credibility crisis and the contagion spreading it to other vulnerable economies. To make this effort feasible, the ﬁscal consolidation programme has to be accompanied by structural measures designed to strengthen the potential growth of the economy, since this largely determines the sustainability of public ﬁnances. In this respect, it is vital to correct the inefﬁciencies which have grown up in the labour market, since here the required reform will largely determine Spain’s ability to become more competitive and generate employment. Nor should it be overlooked that a relatively signiﬁcant part of the increase in the budget deﬁcit in the last two years is directly or indirectly related to the rise in unemployment. The priority of the labour market reform in no way detracts from the importance of pushing ahead with reforms in the product markets, particularly in the services sector, aimed at ensuring more ﬂexible and efﬁcient overall functioning of the economy that will permit continued productivity growth. This is a ﬁeld in which numerous initiatives have been adopted and in which the policy followed in recent years has earned a good reputation. The main challenge lies in timely and rigorous implementation of the measures announced and in maintaining the pace of reform.  As part of the measures needed to successfully exit the crisis and overcome the problems of credibility spread by contagion, the orderly restructuring of the ﬁnancial system is vital in order to complete the adjustment of the accumulated imbalances and pave the way for the recovery of economic growth, competitiveness and job creation.  I will therefore devote the last part of my address to the challenges posed by the restructuring of our ﬁnancial system, a process which has to be set against that of restructuring the regulatory and supervisory frameworks of the international ﬁnancial markets. In my presentation of the 2008 Annual Report, I explained in some detail why such an in-depth revision of the regulatory framework was necessary, so here I will limit myself to the key changes proposed in the work currently under way.  Two main areas of change can be distinguished: the supranational organisational framework and a new regulatory system.  
BIS Review 86/2010 7 With regard to how the supranational institutions competent in this area are being reorganised, special mention should be made of the political impetus from the new extended G20, since without its contribution the reform of international regulation would have been unlikely to advance so strongly. Also, the recently created Financial Stability Board (FSB), which replaces the Financial Stability Forum and of which Spain has become a full member, is playing a central role in this process of change. The FSB is charged with identifying vulnerabilities of the international ﬁnancial system and coordinating the responses of the national authorities and other international fora. In addition, it oversees the international application of regulatory and supervisory standards, promotes the development of the colleges of supervisors and prepares the contingency plans required for managing international ﬁnancial crises.  Sweeping changes are also afoot within the European Union in micro-prudential and macro-prudential supervision. In the ﬁrst, although ultimate responsibility will continue to lie with national supervisors, the European System of Financial Supervisors will be in charge of improving the quality and consistency of supervision, strengthening that of cross-border groups and establishing a single set of rules applicable to all European ﬁnancial institutions. In the macro-prudential area, which can be deﬁned concisely as that entrusted with identifying systemic risks, responsibility will lie with the European Systemic Risk Board, which also makes the recommendations or proposes the corrective measures it considers appropriate.  Noteworthy in the area of regulation are the proposals made by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, which directly address the need to increase the amount and quality of capital held by institutions to absorb potential losses, the advisability of introducing minimum liquidity standards, and the usefulness of creating capital cushions to help moderate credit cycles. Speciﬁcally with regard to the aim of dampening the tendency of markets to amplify economic cycles, headway is being made in the design of provisioning systems which, in essence, are similar to those in place in Spain since mid-2000 (the dynamic or countercyclical provision). International accounting regulators, particularly the IASB, also seem to be converging towards these systems. Also with the aim of mitigating excessively procyclical behaviour of ﬁnancial markets, management compensation guidelines have been drawn up to discourage excessively risky strategies.  Also in the pipeline are major regulatory changes to mitigate the moral hazard problems posed by institutions which in various ways ultimately acquire what has come to be known as systemic signiﬁcance.  Naturally, this regulatory adjustment will have a signiﬁcant impact on ﬁnancial institutions. That means that, irrespective of how long a transition period is deemed appropriate, ﬁnancial intermediaries should now set in motion the adjustment process, to ensure the least possible upheaval. Spain’s ﬁnancial institutions have understood this and are notably strengthening both the level and quality of their capital.  The restructuring process of the Spanish banking system runs alongside the reform of the global ﬁnancial system. As part of this essential restructuring, all institutions, according to their individual characteristics and circumstances, must strengthen their solvency, resizing and improving their efﬁciency in the medium term. In short, the challenge consists in adapting to the new reality in which the ﬁnancial sector will have to operate in the future.  The Spanish banking system is generally in a sound position from which to approach this restructuring process. But the present situation is complicated. On the one hand, the need for loan loss provisions will continue to dent proﬁt and loss accounts, as defaults persist against a continuing weak economic backdrop. And on the other, the competition to secure retail funding pushes up the cost of borrowing and drives down margins. Strains in the wholesale funding markets add further pressure. They also entail higher risk premia and, if they persist and intensify, could make access to the wholesale markets more difﬁcult.  
8 BIS Review 86/2010 Moreover, the sector must absorb the internal imbalances that built up in the years of strong growth in the economy and in banking activity. These imbalances, which are greater in some Spanish deposit institutions than in others, are essentially threefold.  The ﬁrst imbalance derives from their over-reliance on wholesale market funding. Although the term structure of Spain’s ﬁnancial institutions’ debt is mostly medium and long-term, the severity of the crisis and investor ﬂight in view of a widespread loss in conﬁdence put pressure on institutions, which responded by stepping up their efforts to attract deposits. But changing deposit structures is a lengthy process.  The second imbalance that the Spanish banking sector must overcome derives from its continuing high exposure to the construction and real estate sector, which after a lengthy period of excessive growth is now undergoing a severe adjustment. The Banco de España’s latest Financial Stability Report laid bare both the potential scale of the exposure to this sector of activity and the coverage existing to meet any associated risks.  In this respect, the Banco de España has just published, for public consultation, an amendment of its ﬁnancial reporting standards, in particular those relating to estimation of necessary credit risk coverage. Without going into further details here, sufﬁce it to say that the reform deals with transparency and with the establishment of minimum criteria for institutions; criteria which have been simpliﬁed and made more consistent and which primarily respond to the lessons learned during the crisis. Moreover, and although in this respect there was no need for regulatory reform, the changes clearly reafﬁrm the understanding that certain banking practices, such as asset foreclosures, despite being legitimate problem management tools, cannot in any circumstances warrant delaying the recognition of losses.  The third imbalance is connected with the Spanish banking industry’s excess capacity. During the growth years, banking sector activity rose very signiﬁcantly. In a retail banking model based on proximity to customers, this continued upsurge in activity prompted sharp growth in organisational structures and in new branch openings. Moreover, in a highly competitive environment, many institutions whose customer base was typically linked to a speciﬁc region responded by looking for new markets, opening branches beyond their traditional geographical area.  Clearly there was no sense in maintaining these organisational structures and such a dense branch network, with all the associated costs, at a time when the future outlook for banking activity was considerably less favourable than previous to summer 2007, and considering also the impact of possible margin squeezes.  Restructuring is clearly the responsibility of the banks themselves. But the authorities designed the FROB (Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking Sector) as a mechanism to further this process in a way that would minimise the burden for the taxpayer. As a result, and as the banking sector overall is in a healthy position, Spain has been spared the voluminous and widespread recapitalisations, with no commitment to restructuring, seen elsewhere.  The FROB envisaged action on two fronts. On the one hand, it gave the Banco de España broad powers to take control of any institution that were to fail. And on the other, on what we could call the preventive side, it allowed ﬁnancial support to be provided for the restructuring of viable institutions and their management teams, and helped them digest the process; that said, the institutions themselves, and especially those that had experienced management failures, would have to bear the attendant cost. This meant that private sector solutions were prioritised, as has been seen in the processes that have unfolded in the past few months.  Today, it is fair to say that the restructuring and recapitalisation of Spain’s ﬁnancial institutions is well under way. It is now just a case of formalising and implementing the agreements reached. As a result, Spain’s deposit institutions that did not already have sufﬁcient capital have now secured it, either from the markets or from the FROB. The Banco 
BIS Review 86/2010 9 de España has conducted stress tests to verify that all institutions – banks, savings banks and credit co-operatives – will actually have sufﬁcient capital available, not only for what would currently seem to be the most reasonable scenarios, but also for complex growth scenarios in the near future. Accordingly, before end-June, the Banco de España will take the steps necessary to formalise the processes already agreed and to ensure they are correctly implemented. If, by month-end, any of these processes has failed, or any institution has been left behind, the Bank will act, using the mechanisms envisaged for this purpose in the FROB legislation.  Moreover, the Bank intends to publish the results of these stress tests, to reveal the deterioration estimated, the consequent capital requirements and the capital funding committed, to provide the markets with a perfectly clear idea of the situation of the Spanish banking system.  Thus, before the summer, the restructuring of the banking system should be complete, save for a legal reform allowing savings banks to obtain high-quality capital on the market, to meet the new Basel standards. The government has the agreement of Spain’s main opposition party for the successful passage of this legal reform through Parliament.  The restructuring and reform of the ﬁnancial system, along with the budgetary adjustment, the public pension reform and the labour market reform, are the most urgent measures needed to restore conﬁdence in the Spanish economy, and, as such, should be passed before the summer recess. But the process must not stop there, as further measures are needed to stimulate the recovery in growth and the modernisation of the Spanish economy. Vital tasks remain, such as: educational reform; the modernisation of general government and the removal of overlaps between the different tiers of government; guiding investment in infrastructure towards projects that enhance the competitiveness of Spanish ﬁrms; privatising or streamlining public corporations; increasing competition in network industries and particularly in energy; promoting collective bargaining agreements in the private sector that raise the competitiveness of the Spanish economy and thus create employment, etc. And not only at national or central government level, but also among regional and local governments, trade unions, employers’ associations and other economic and social agents. At this point in time, we must all face up to our responsibilities, with the corresponding costs and sacriﬁces. Accordingly, let me conclude by expressing the Banco de España’s ﬁrm commitment to play its part, and to urge others to do the same. 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 Sada S Reddy: The future for Fiji’s economy Presentation by Mr Sada S Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, to the Fiji Institute of Accountants, Yanuca, Fiji, 11 June 2010. *      *      * The President of the Fiji Institute of Accountants, Distinguished Guests, Ladies & Gentlemen Good Morning Thank you for inviting me to speak to you on the Future for Fiji’s economy. It goes without saying, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a daunting task for the Governor of a central bank to speak on given that a central bank has a much narrower role in the economy. The role of a central bank first and foremost is to maintain price stability. This in itself is a very challenging role. On top of this, in Fiji’s case, we also have an equally important task of ensuring that our balance of payment is sustainable. In other words, we have to ensure that our foreign reserves are kept at adequate levels. I am sure most of you in the audience have been closely following the developments in this regard in Fiji over a number of years but more importantly, over the last three years, with the onset of the global economic and financial crisis. Ladies and gentlemen, herein lies the reason for me to muster the courage to talk to you today about Fiji’s economy and how I see its future. In some respects, my speech will be a “HARDTALK ON FIJI’S ECONOMY”. To get a better idea of our future, it is important to look to the past, learn from the lessons and chart a way forward for our country. In doing this, we must also understand how domestic and external factors impact our economy. Ladies and gentlemen, I will first look at the performance of the global economy, particularly at the performance of our trading partner countries.  I will then discuss the domestic economy, where I will touch on Fiji’s macroeconomic performance and challenges, and what we must do to ensure that we secure a better future for all. 1. Global Economic Conditions and Outlook Let me begin by summarizing the conditions in the global economy. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to grow by 4.2 percent this year, following a contraction of 0.6% in 2009. Further growth of 4.3 percent is expected in 2011. The contraction of last year is regarded as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. However, that is now well behind us. Ladies and gentlemen, except for Australia, all our trading partner economies contracted last year as a result of the global financial crisis. This significantly affected our exports and tourism last year. However, all of these countries are expected to post a modest growth this year and continue this into 2011. This is good news for Fiji, as demand for our exports and tourism should increase. In fact, we are already seeing the effects of these, especially in the tourism industry, where we see a strong recovery in visitor arrivals. Overall, the global economy has performed better than expected. Among advanced countries, the US economy is doing better than Europe and Japan, while for emerging and developing economies, Asia is driving the recovery. 
2 BIS Review 86/2010 China and India recorded high growth rates in 2009 and are expected to record similar growth in 2010. China’s growth quickened to around 12 percent in the first quarter of this year, the fastest pace in almost three years, driven by stimulus spending and a credit boom. Having said that, we are also witnessing some countries, especially in the Euro area, experiencing great economic difficulties due to debt service problems arising from running several years of large fiscal deficits. And this was compounded by the global crisis. For this reason, growth in the Euro area will be very uncertain. And these uncertainties are causing significant risks to the international capital markets as well as prospects for growth worldwide. Once again this demonstrates the great risks out there for a sustained global growth. 2. Macroeconomic Performance and Challenges Ladies and gentlemen, let me now share with you my views on the Fiji economy. This is not going to be an easy task. Why? This is because the current state of our economy is a result not only of recent global and domestic developments but it is due to some very long-term fundamental problems in the economy, going back ten, twenty years. These issues have been compounded by various governance issues both at the national and at organizational and/or industry levels.  For now, let me begin by saying that Fiji has huge potential. I do not think anyone in this audience will disagree with me. We have huge potential in tourism, agriculture, forestry, fishing, sports, ITC etc. Fiji is endowed with rich natural resources such as land, a huge marine environment, and minerals such as gold, copper and other minerals. Fiji’s tropical climate and pristine environment is a huge advantage which attracts thousands of tourists to our shores. Fiji’s relatively more developed status places it as the financial and trade hub of the South Pacific. Our people are well educated and are a great asset for the progress and development of this nation.  However, despite its richness in resources and huge potential, Fiji’s economic situation over the past two decades has been characterised by low economic growth, low investments, and deteriorating balance of payments (BOP). Why has our growth been so low in the past? On the one hand, we have been prone to factors out of our control which include natural disasters, adverse global developments such as the recent financial crisis, and the erosion of preferential market access. On the other hand, but within our control, our sluggish growth over the past years has been largely due to our slow progress on economic and structural reforms and declining terms of trade, which are essential to support a balanced economic growth path. As a result of this slow growth, unemployment levels have risen. Let me now talk about the performance and challenges in Fiji’s major sectors, beginning with the overall economy. Over the past 10 years (2000–2009), Fiji’s economy has grown, on average, by just 0.7 percent per year. Looking at past trends, growth rates have been anything but stable during the last decade. Furthermore, economic growth has not been able to match the population growth rate, which means that per capita income growth in Fiji has been slowing over the last two decades. Our economy has been contracting over the last 3 years. Last year our economy declined by 2.2 percent. However, we expect to see a slight growth of 1.8 percent this year. We expect similar growth rates in 2011 and 2012 of around 1.5–2.0 percent. Ladies and gentlemen, a number of factors have contributed to this 3-year contraction in the economy. Of course, you know the significant impact the global crisis has had on our economy. In addition to that, we had several natural disasters that we had to contend with. 
BIS Review 86/2010 3 We also saw during this period, some of our large projects getting into financial difficulties not because of any domestic issues but because of the difficulties foreign developers had with their financiers offshore. And a number of construction projects were affected in this way which had significant negative effects on the economy. For this year, we are expecting all sectors to show positive growth except for agriculture & forestry and health & social work sectors, which have projected declines.  The agriculture sector was badly hit by Cyclone Tomas, resulting in a downward revision of the overall growth rate for this year.  Next year, growth is also expected to be broad-based, apart from an expected decline in the building and construction sector. The tourism industry is expected to lead the growth assisted by some growth in agriculture. Let me now move to the performance and challenges of major sectors. I begin with sugar. Sugar has traditionally been the backbone of Fiji’s economy. Apart from its direct benefits, the industry has also had significant benefits to the economy. However, the sugar industry has been plagued with on-going problems for a number of years which we were unable to solve decisively and now these problems are threatening the viability of the industry. The cane and sugar industry’s contribution to real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has fallen over the years. This industry now contributes only around 3.0 percent to real GDP, a significant fall in contribution when compared to around 11–12 percent contribution  10–15 years ago. Following a peak of around 500,000 tonnes of sugar produced in 1994, production has steadily declined. Last year, sugarcane output was the lowest since 1961. The total sugar output last season was 168,000 tonnes. The significant fall in sugar output last year was due largely to the inefficiency of the sugar mills, which affected sugar production. The sugar industry today faces major challenges. These challenges have to be addressed urgently. Areas of reforms needed in the sugar industry are:  The FSC’s financial problems have to be quickly fixed. Its cashflow situation is dire to say the least.  Factory problems must be fixed as soon as possible. The mill-upgrade programme under way for the last few years has not delivered to expectations and resulted in huge losses to the millers, farmers and the country as a whole. The FSC had to go into huge debt because of the mill upgrade programme. The substandard work done by the contractors resulted in huge losses last year. It was a disaster to say the least. However, the Board and Management of the FSC are now confident that this year’s crushing season should go well;   The industry needs to put in strategies to increase cane production to two or three times the current production in the next 24 months. For this they need land and financial support. They have to re-habilitate large number of cane farms which are producing well below industry norms due to neglect of farms and long ratooning rather than planting new cane every three to four years. Productivity must be improved through farm rationalization plus good farm husbandry practices; and  Large scale commercial cane farming must be explored and developed. The garment industry is another sector where output has fallen over the years. The garment industry in Fiji began in 1988, following the introduction of the tax free schemes in 1987. Over the past ten years, the garment industry contributed on average, 3.4 percent to Fiji’s real GDP with garment production peaking in 2001 with production valued at around $188 million. However, the expiry of trade agreements and strong competition from Asian economies has seen production dwindle. In 2004, the Government withdrew the tax free factory status given to exporters to comply with the WTO requirements (World Trade Organisation). In addition, 
4 BIS Review 86/2010 since 2005, the industry suffered the loss of a quota system for garment exports to the United States, which saw the closure of a major garment manufacturer, which generated approximately 50% of total garment production. Moreover, the implementation of the minimum wage regulation effective from July 2009, has increased the cost of producing garments. On average, the industry contracted by 6.5 percent from 2006 to 2009. These developments have further weakened garment production. Strategies are needed to revive the garment industry as we have seen that Fiji’s garment industry is able to produce high quality garments. What about the forestry sector? Over the last 15 years, timber production has fallen notably. In 1995, timber output reached a total of 600,000 cubic meters. To reach similar levels now, we would need to increase output by 150,000 cubic meters per year. Support for implementing the necessary infrastructure and value-adding must be considered. There is a need to explore and develop strategic partners and work to enhance the capacity of resource owners. Improving road access to indigenous timber resources is also necessary. Certification of our timber is imperative for us to market Fiji timber for premium prices in the world market. In light of these changes, the recent move by the Government to restructure the mahogany industry is very encouraging. With the promulgation of the Mahogany Industry Development Decree 2010, in March this year, we are hopeful that the opening of access to mahogany timber will generate much needed export earnings for Fiji in time to come. The Decree seeks to ensure that the mahogany industry is able to provide suitable and sustainable returns for the betterment of the economy and the people of Fiji and creating a distinct brand for Fijian Mahogany. It will facilitate a sustainable harvesting and reforestation program with the view to create a liberalised mahogany industry with maximum returns to Fiji. In addition, with the encouragement from the Government, the Kadavu Provincial Council has allowed the Fiji Pine Limited (FPL) to harvest pine plantations on the island of Kadavu. Kadavu has close to 92,000 cubic metres of pine ready for harvest. The FPL has agreed to harvest, weigh and pay resource owners the value of the trees straight after harvest. The FPL mentioned that for every tree harvested, the Company would re-plant three more. This form of sustainable operations will not only boost foreign income in the short term but will provide a platform for long term gains. We need more of such initiatives in maritime areas which have the right soil and climate for pine and mahogany forests.  Sandalwood also, I believe, has great potential. There should be special efforts made to plant more of these forests. Let me now turn to the fishing industry. Fishing industry output has fallen from potential levels of around 30,000 tonnes reached in 2005 to around 13,000 tonnes in 2009. This can be done if all the stakeholders come together to develop a well articulated plan for the fishing industry to drive growth and increase value of our exports. How about the mining sector? The re-start of the Emperor Gold Mine is very encouraging and the mine is gradually increasing production. We need to raise gold production from the current levels of around 35,000 ounces to our potential of 150,000 ounces per annum. We had achieved these levels in the past. We must explore the possibility of new gold mines and other metals and minerals. Recent information on the Wainivesi gold project in Tailevu shows that mining commenced in quarter three of 2009, but has not progressed well due to power and milling problems. In addition, a bauxite mining project in Nawailevu, Bua is expected to start soon and may bring in much needed foreign exchange. Moreover, copper exploration in Namosi and gold prospecting in Tuvatu are progressing well. The ongoing review of the mining legislation, expected to be completed by end of June this year, is encouraging.  Ladies and gentlemen, agriculture holds a great promise for this country. At the recent Agriculture Symposium sponsored by the Government, a number of very good initiatives 
BIS Review 86/2010 5 were agreed to by the various stakeholders who attended the Symposium. We hope these initiatives will be taken on board and timely progress is made.  We are very encouraged by the energy and vigour we have seen recently in the Ministry of Agriculture. In June this year, the first batch of potato seedlings was planted at Navai in Nadarivatu. We have been told that the Flour Mills of Fiji (FMF) will work closely with the farmers that have been earmarked for potato cultivation this year. I understand the FMF currently buys 400,000 kilograms of potatoes annually for producing potato chips and with this new venture, the FMF will be able to lessen the import bill for potatoes. We would like this type of activity for other agricultural and livestock products which we consume in large amounts, but are not self-sufficient in. These include rice, dairy, lamb and beef to name a few. Our export sector has performed below potential over the years. This is attributed to our narrow export base and other structural impediments hindering growth of key potential sectors as I mentioned before. The average growth of exports over the last 15 years was 4 percent. In 2009, exports fell by around 16.4 percent driven by re-exports, sugar, mineral water, timber garments and coconut oil. However increases in earnings were noted for molasses, sweet biscuits, gold and fish. In 2010 total exports are projected to grow by 9.5 percent. Further growth is envisaged for 2011 and 2012. Some export commodities have shown a consistent growth trend, such as mineral water which has performed exceptionally well over the past decade. This trend needs to be maintained and improved. Ladies and gentlemen, for us to lift our GDP growth from the current low levels to around 5 percent, we need nearly F$500 to F$600m, additional foreign exchange receipts every year. If not the bop constraint we are facing now will not be solved and our policies cannot be relaxed to allow for easier business conditions.  Why is it that we have this bop constraint? This is because our exports are not keeping pace with our imports.  Imports have continued to escalate. Fuel imports are around one third of our total import bill, which is very high for a country of our size. Total imports grew at an average rate of over 6 percent over the past 15 years.  In the next 3 years, we must reduce our fuel imports by $300 million and we need to put strategies in place for that to happen immediately. Some initiatives in place include renewable energy projects as well as encouraging energy conservation practices. Government is offering attractive incentives for renewable energy producers. These include tax-holidays, tax rebates, and lower duties. The Fiji Electricity Authority has a renewable energy development program which aims to provide 90 percent of energy through renewable sources by 2011. Currently, around 60 to 70 percent of FEA’s annual electricity output is generated by renewable energy sources. The ongoing Nadarivatu hydro project, when completed, should add 41.7 mega watts of power to the national power grid and produce around 100 million units of electricity on a yearly basis.  On its part, the RBF has recently introduced an Import Substitution Facility to try to assist large scale commercial agricultural businesses to obtain credit at concessional rates of interest. The RBF has also offered a scholarship for Chef Training in Malaysia which should encourage the use of local foods in preparation of hotel menus. This is targeted at reducing our import bill and improving our balance of payments position, as well as encouraging local value adding. I wish to repeat my message once again to the hotel industry. Please do everything in your power to reduce your consumption of imports. This will go a long way in assisting our bop. I wish to congratulate those hotels which have taken the effort to start growing their own fruits and vegetables. This is very encouraging indeed. 
6 BIS Review 86/2010 As a result of the trend of declining exports and rising imports, the country has been faced with a deteriorating trade deficit and an associated current account deficit which reached a new high recently. The current account deficit is estimated at around 9 percent of GDP in 2009. A 9 percent current account deficit is unsustainable. Therefore, we have to do everything in our power to increase export earnings and reduce imports.  Tourism has picked up well following the global downturn. In my view, under the current circumstances, tourism holds the greatest potential to lift Fiji’s growth rate. The Tourism Development Plan has set a target of 1 million visitors by 2016. We should aim to raise visitor arrivals threefold in the next three years. The industry and the Government should develop clear strategies to make this happen.  It is very encouraging to see three new airlines have started operations to Fiji since December 2009, with our own Air Pacific adding Hong Kong to its list of destinations. This has linked Fiji to new markets and should boost future visitor arrivals.  Let me now touch briefly on Government finances. Fiji has experienced chronic budget deficits over the past two decades. The proportion of capital expenditure to total Government expenditure has been low. On the other hand, operating expenditure has continued to balloon over the years. In 2009, the proportion of operating expenditure to total Government expenditure was 80 percent. The major driver of rising operating expenditure has been personnel costs. Personnel cost as a percent of operating expenditure had been quite high at 43.5 percent in the 1990–1999 period before rising to 49.5 percent in  2000–2009 period. It is encouraging to see that the Government is taking a number of initiatives to reduce the size of civil service and thus reduce Government’s operating expenditure. As a result of continuous fiscal deficits, Government debt has risen over the last two decades. Currently, it stands at around 52 percent of GDP. For Fiji it is estimated that a more sustainable level should be around 45 percent of GDP.  Ladies and gentlemen, fiscal discipline is very critical for sustainable economic growth. If Government continues to run large deficits then not only the debt levels increase, it crowds out the private sector and statutory bodies from borrowing in the domestic market thus putting pressure on interest rates. Chronic fiscal deficits also tend to seriously undermine the bop as has been the case in Fiji for last two decades or so. It is therefore very important that the Government budget deficit is kept in check and reigned in to well below 3 percent in the medium term. I would suggest that for the future the Government should consider legislating a Fiscal Responsibility Act so that future Governments do not squander Government finances and run irresponsible fiscal policies. We are pleased to see that despite the enormous pressures on Government revenue in recent years, due to the contracting economy, the Government has kept a reasonably tight reign on Government expenditure. This discipline must continue and more should be done to reign in non-essential expenditures. Ladies and gentlemen, I wish to highlight the importance of keeping the contingent liabilities of the Government under control. The Government’s contingent liabilities have grown substantially over the past several years. Total contingent liabilities of the Government in 2009 were around $1.7 billion, equivalent to about 26.5 percent of GDP. This level of contingent liabilities is extremely high given the weak revenue base of the Government. This trend must be stopped because what it does is that without the Government really knowing what is really going on in the institutions whose debts Government has guaranteed, suddenly Government is faced with those contingent liabilities coming on to the Government’s books and thus, seriously compromising Government’s finances. 
BIS Review 86/2010 7 There were a number of instances in the past where the Government had to step in to bail out because of the guarantees. One very well known case is the National Bank of Fiji (NBF). The collapse of NBF cost the taxpayers of this country around $372 million in total. In more recent times, Government had to convert nearly $40 million of Housing Authority debt to equity because Housing Authority was in no position to meet the debt commitments. There are signs that few other institutions whose debt Government has guaranteed may not be in a position to meet their obligations. This situation must not be allowed to continue.  Government must carry out proper due diligence on statutory corporations which seek Government guarantees. If such organisations are not properly managed and run, Government must put conditions to any guarantees it gives in future so that proper reforms are done to make these institutions financially viable so that they borrow on their own strength in the market. There is a huge moral hazard problem here. The Boards and Management of these statutory bodies take it for granted that the Government is there to bail them out if they get into difficulties. So, they fail to take timely corrective actions to reform the institutions they are in charge of. Ladies and gentlemen, a number of people have commented on the US$150 million bond that was issued by the Government in September 2006 due for repayment in September 2011. Their concern, rightly so, is whether we have the capability to repay this loan. I would like to reassure you that the Government and the RBF are actively exploring all possibilities to meet this repayment and Fiji as usual will meet all its foreign obligations whatever it takes. Ladies and gentlemen, against the economic challenges we face, what can we do to raise growth? Basically, we need to raise investment and exports, improve business conditions, accelerate reforms, raise productivity and diversify the economy. We need to raise investment in Fiji to over 25 percent of GDP from its current level of 13 percent. While we have some local investment, it is not sufficient. Hence we need to attract foreign investment to our shores which entails improving the investor environment. We need to implement policies that will improve the state of our infrastructure, improve productivity levels and lower the cost of business in Fiji. Improving infrastructure is extremely important to facilitate economic growth. Fiji’s infrastructure has suffered from neglect and investment in the past. Government is now taking steps to address infrastructure issues. Recently, Government successfully secured the Exim Bank (Malaysia) loan of over $40 million for its road upgrading project. In addition, Government has allocated around $60 million for water and sewerage schemes in various districts of which the Suva/Nausori water and sewerage scheme is worth over $30 million alone. Another $9.5 million has been set aside for maintenance of Government properties/buildings, including hospitals, police stations and Government quarters. Government is also actively working with the Chinese Government for loans for improving roads and other infrastructure projects. The loan to Housing Authority by the Chinese Government is very timely to provide much needed low cost housing.  Ladies and gentlemen, reliance on preferential access is now a thing of the past, and we must stand on our own feet. We live in a world of competition where many countries have low cost structures and high productivity. Therefore, unless we raise our productivity and do business in a smarter way, we will not be able to compete successfully against the rest of the world. The main test for our industries will be to improve their productivity and compete on the global scene – there will be no easy way out for them.  In this regard, let me touch on important reforms that are critically needed to unlock the growth potential of Fiji. For one reason or the other, these much needed reforms have not 
8 BIS Review 86/2010 been successfully implemented in the past. Government has recently announced a major reform agenda, known as the Economic Reform Programme 2010–2014. These reforms include:  Good Governance (Constitutional, Parliamentary and Electoral Reforms)   Civil Service  Public Sector (FSC, FEA, FHCL, LTA, Govt Shipping, National Road Safety Council, etc.)  Financial Sector (FNPF)  Availability and Utilisation of Land  Price Controls I am confident that a successful completion of these reforms will create efficiencies, improve productivity and competitiveness and improve business and investor confidence in Fiji. Hopefully with these various reforms, the cost and ease of doing business will greatly improve. Also, structural reforms are critical to ensuring fiscal sustainability, which will stimulate growth and help reduce poverty levels. Specifically, the Government’s plan for right-sizing as well as corporatizing, privatizing or outsourcing non-core service areas is vital to this end. Price liberalization is also critical in ensuring right price signals are given, which will support the process of structural adjustment.  3. Summary In summary, current economic conditions show a recovering global economy, although at uneven rates amongst advanced economies. Strong growth of the Asian economies will drive the global growth. Against this background, the domestic economy is expected to pick up, albeit weakly.  While foreign reserves are stable and inflation has peaked, concerns and risks remain. On the external front, high oil prices would place downside risks to the inflation outlook and the balance of payments. Ensuring macroeconomic stability is vital for achieving a sustainable growth target of 5 percent. A consistent set of policies is needed to ensure that the stage is set for the economy to grow sustainably into the future. Essentially, we need supportive fiscal and monetary policies to ensure a stable macroeconomic environment, in which structural adjustment can be successful. As you are aware, the Reserve Bank continues to implement policy changes to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity in the banking system at all times, and that our foreign reserves and inflation targets are not threatened. This has entailed recent changes in interest rates and the implementation of a new monetary policy framework. However, considering the limited scope that monetary policy has, it is extremely critical that fiscal policy is at the forefront of meeting the challenges I have outlined.  The Government has shown great commitment towards fiscal consolidation; however, it needs to speed up the progress on structural reforms, specifically on key sectors that drive economic growth. With these measures, ladies and gentlemen, I believe we will set in place a framework that would allow the economy to grow on a sustainable basis in the future.  Thank you very much. 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 K C Chakrabarty: Financial deepening by putting financial inclusion campaign into mission mode Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 23rd Skoch Summit, Mumbai, 17 June 2010. *      *      * 1. Dr C Rangarajan, Hon’ble Chairman, Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, Mr Hari Sankaran, Managing Director and CEO, IL& FS, Shri S. S. Tarapore, Distinguished Fellow, Skoch Development Foundation, Shri J Sriram, CEO Mobile Commerce Venture, Bharti Airtel Ltd, and of course the main organiser of this function Mr Sameer Kochhar, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I have come here to say a few words about financial inclusion which is closely related to the topic of this Summit, i.e. Financial Deepening. One of the preconditions for deepening of any process is the existence of a large number of participants. Hence, financial inclusion is a necessary condition for financial deepening. 2.  Let us consider how financial deepening can address concerns of growth with equity and ensure pro-poor growth. Financial sector development and deepening drives economic growth by mobilizing savings and investing in the growth of the productive sectors. The institutional infrastructure of the financial system contributes to reducing information, contracting and transaction costs, which in turn accelerates economic growth and promotes pro-poor growth. We firmly believe that increasing financial inclusion reduces the economic vulnerability of households, promotes economic growth, alleviates poverty and improves the quality of peoples’ lives. Thus, expansion of banking leads to increasing availability of finance to spur economic growth and helps alleviate poverty. Barriers to this process 3.  Barriers for poor people to access appropriate financial services include  socio-economic factors e.g., lack of education-illiteracy, gender and age, low and irregular income, and geography, regulatory factors e.g. mandatory requirements of identity documentation and product design factors. 4.  A major barrier cited to expand appropriate services to poor by financial service providers is the cost of providing those services including administering small loans. While transaction costs do not vary in direct proportion to a transaction’s size and larger number of transactions bring down the costs, serving the poor with small value services is not viable using conventional retail banking or insurance approaches. We have to promote technological and institutional innovation as a means to expand financial system access and usage, including addressing infrastructure weaknesses. 5.  Innovation in delivery and design of financial services targeting the poor and the excluded, presents challenging policy and regulatory issues. Even the G-20 has set up the Financial Inclusion Experts Group to address these issues of ensuring Financial Inclusion and global safety nets. Global awareness of the challenges and barriers and hands-on experience with policy, regulation and supervision is limited. Industry innovation has thus far frequently outpaced the capacity of policymakers to respond. When we talk of reaching to the people, we must understand what types of problems are faced by customers and what is the solution. Any policy and regulatory responses will therefore need to focus on articulating flexible approaches that can take account of multiple and competing objectives and that can accommodate further innovation. A key source of innovation is the capacity of technology to reduce costs and overcome other barriers to the provision of sustainable financial services to the excluded. 
2 BIS Review 86/2010 6.  Till a few years ago, there was a dearth of appropriate technology. But, now that technology has arrived, we have taken several initiatives to bring about financial inclusion. What we require is a business model and a delivery model. With this in view, RBI advised banks to formulate a board approved financial inclusion plan for the next three years. All banks have drawn up their financial inclusion plans and we are engaged in active discussions with banks on their plans. Through this approach, we are putting the financial inclusion campaign into mission mode. Based on our assessment and learning, we have advised them to review and revise their plans. Our broad approach on achieving planned, sustained and structured financial inclusion is as under: Technology: seamless integration of front-end with back-end 7.  First, the transformational role of technology needs to emphasised. Financial deepening is taking banking to people. We are speaking of this for the last four decades post nationalization; we have failed if we see that the current coverage is of barely 32,000 rural commercial bank branches. Scalable financial inclusion cannot happen without stable and reliable Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Not only the bank branches but also the branches of Regional Rural Bank’s must also be on Core Banking Solution (CBS), without which it would not be possible to scale up the financial inclusion efforts. The transactions through the hand held front end-devices should be seamlessly integrated with banks’ main server. These devices must be capable of transacting the four minimum products as mentioned in a subsequent paragraph. There should be a provision in the smart card for integration with the UID number under the Aadhaar Project. Banking services: need to increase the bouquets of products 8.  Second, it is not enough to open a No Frills Accounts (NFA) and maintain that banking services are available. De minimus, four banking products need to be provided for it to qualify as availability of banking services. These are: a. A Savings cum overdraft account b. A Pure Savings Product ideally a recurring or variable recurring deposit c. A Remittance Product for EBT and other remittances d. Entrepreneurial Credit such as GCC, KCC The number of NFA opened present a very rosy picture, however, evaluation studies show that accounts once opened lie dormant as the poor do not have enough money to put in the deposit accounts. Hence, the need to transact is not there. If the banks want customer acquisition and that poor customers transact with them, they must permit overdrafts in the accounts. To begin with, very small amounts such as Rs 200, Rs 500 etc. could be sanctioned. The needs of the poor for consumption smoothing and for lifecycle events such as medical emergency, weddings, funerals, etc. are pressing and need immediate gratification. They need to be made aware that to meet their emergency credit needs, an overdraft facility exists and they can avail should they require. This would bring them to the banks to transact and enable the banks to sell other products apart from making the entire exercise viable. For those, who only wish to save, a pure savings product like a recurring or a variable recurring deposit product could be offered. A remittance product to facilitate EBT or other remittances should also be offered. For entrepreneurial credit, products such as GCC, KCC, etc. could be offered. This is the minimum set of products that needs to be offered. Beyond this, banks are free to provide any other products such as insurance, mutual funds, etc. as per their assessment and capability. 
BIS Review 86/2010 3 Coverage: need for transparency 9.  Third, the issue of coverage. So far, even when a customer from a remote village comes and opens an account with a bank branch in a city, that city branch includes that remote village as covered by banking services. We are clarifying that for a village to be considered covered by banking services, either a bank branch has to be present or a Business Correspondent (BC) is visiting/present in that village. There must be a bifurcation between villages with more than 2000 population and those with less than 2000 population. The plan needs to cover in an integrated manner both categories of villages. The names of the BC/branch covering a particular village need to be indicated on the banks website. Financial inclusion plan: integrated with banks’ business plans  10.  Fourth, financial inclusion plans must be integrated with the normal business plans of the banks. We believe that banking to the poor is a viable business opportunity but costs and benefit exercise needs to be attempted by the banks to make financial inclusion congruent with their business models. Banks must view financial inclusion as a huge business opportunity and perfect their delivery models. Operational issues: need for intermediate structure 11.  Fifth, the banks need to examine the operational issues related to the BC model such as cash handling. They need to evaluate whether an intermediate brick and mortar structure is required between the base bank branch and BCs for more effective supervision of the BCs. This structure, which should be manned by banks’ own skeletal staff can have a safe where BCs can deposit cash, a CBS terminal and passbook printing facility. Over a period of time, this can morph into a full fledged satellite branch of the Bank Urban financial inclusion: not to be lost sight of  12.  Sixth, financial inclusion is sometimes erroneously treated as synonymous with rural poverty. Concerns of urban poverty also need to be factored in and the needs of various groups as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, migrant workers, etc. must be factored in and products and services crafted as per their needs by the banking system to address urban financial inclusion. Monitoring: need for a structured approach 13.  Seventh, we would be closely monitoring the progress made by the banks as per their financial inclusion plans. A structured reporting format has been made available for meaningful compilation and analysis of data. The banks need to do similar structured data compilation exercise at the state/district level which will facilitate monitoring at the district/state/bank level. A structured approach will ensure that this time the outcome of our financial inclusion efforts will be different and will not meet the same fate as previous ones. Other issues 14.  Let me reiterate that financial inclusion is not mere State Benefit Transfers. Loans must be extended and savings and borrowings habits need to be inculcated among the poor. Poor do not require cheap credit but prompt credit. It is an anomaly that while they are pressed to pay exorbitant rates of interest to the money lender, the mainstream financial institutions are still shy of lending to them. In the ultimate analysis, financial inclusion is a driver of economic growth and poverty alleviation. 
4 BIS Review 86/2010 15.  Inclusive financial sector development makes two complementary contributions to poverty alleviation: financial sector development is a driver of economic growth which indirectly reduces poverty and inequality; and appropriate, affordable, financial services for poor people. Critical to our efforts at securing sustained economic growth are the expansion of last mile access to finance. Thus financial inclusion is no longer a policy choice but is a policy compulsion. In a bank based model, customers have a direct contractual relationship with a bank or similar prudentially regulated and supervised financial institution – a basic bank account, a savings account, a savings cum overdraft account, a transaction account, a loan, or some combination – even though the customer may deal exclusively with the staff of one or more retail agents hired to conduct transactions on the bank’s behalf. In the non-bank based model the contractual relationship is with a non-bank service provider such as a mobile network operator or an issuer of stored-value payment instruments. Customers exchange cash at a retail agent in return for an electronic record of value. This virtual account is stored on the service provider’s server. Nevertheless, although there is no contractual relationship directly between a bank and a customer, a bank is always involved, for example as a potentially safe and liquid place for the nonbank provider to hold the float .Our model in India as of now is a bank led model and in this way we are able to address consumer protection issues which are of paramount concern given the nature of the vulnerable clientele we are dealing with. Here, financial capability building through financial literacy and education also assume great importance. We have mandated the setting up of Financial Literacy and Credit Counselling Centres which are expected to go a long way in ameliorating the lot of the customer although it should be understood that first we have to provide financial access. 16.  Finally, let me stress that currently we are marketing the paradigm of financial inclusion through the bank-led model. It is thus for the banks to rise up to the challenge and meet it in full measure. What we mean by no access to finance for the excluded is that no access from the formal financial system; so a word of necessary caution for banks; the paradigm of financial inclusion is ultimately one of the continued relevance for the banking sector as other actors are waiting anxiously in the wings waiting for a go ahead. 17.  India has good IT talent as also financial sector talent and hence this experiment to bring ICT based financial inclusion is not only relevant to India but to the entire globe as success of this experiment can be replicated elsewhere. Entire world is looking at these developments with keen interest. We need to meet these expectations. 18.  We have a broad based government-Central Bank commitment to financial inclusion to help alleviate poverty. Our aim is to help create an enabling policy and regulatory environment for innovative financial inclusion. The present enabling environment will critically determine the speed at which the financial services access gap will close for the people currently excluded. 19.  Thank you. I wish the 23rd Skoch Summit all the best and hope the deliberations here throw new light on various aspects of financial deepening. 
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Thomas Jordan: The Swiss banking sector and the next steps in resolving the “too big to fail” issue Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Geneva, 17 June 2010. *      *      * Introduction A year ago, the financial system was still in an extremely fragile state. Crisis management was at the centre of our efforts. Yet even then, we were emphasising the urgent need to alleviate the “too big to fail” issue. Much has happened since that time. The financial sector, hit hard by the crisis, has recovered considerably, and on a national and international level, politicians, supervisory authorities and central banks are working intensively to ease the “too big to fail” issue. The goal is clear: in future, the public and the taxpayer should not have to shoulder the responsibility for rescuing banks. Based on our latest Financial Stability Report, I would like to review first the situation in the banking sector, and second, the next steps in resolving the “too big to fail” issue. Conditions in the Swiss banking sector Conditions in the Swiss banking sector have improved. Following a catastrophic 2008, the situation at UBS stabilised over the course of last year. With regard to Credit Suisse, it is now even possible to speak of a return to normal. Large-scale support measures deployed by governments and central banks played an essential role in ensuring that the global economy, the financial markets and thus also the banks recovered sooner and more vigorously than had been anticipated a year ago. For the banking sector alone, the major industrial nations committed funds amounting to almost 20% of gross domestic product. As a result of the different measures to support the economy and the banking sector, there has been a considerable rise in the indebtedness of many countries, and also, in some countries, in sovereign credit risk. The international big banks – including the Swiss big banks – benefited substantially from these support measures, and were able to increase their profitability in 2009. At the same time, the Swiss big banks reduced their balance sheets by approximately a quarter. Compared to the previous year, their capital situation improved substantially. Their risk-weighted capital ratios, in particular, have increased markedly, and are high also by international standards. This is a very positive development. However, it should not be allowed to conceal the fact that the leverage of both big banks is still high – both per se and when compared with banks in other countries. The big banks are still a long way from meeting the leverage target that will apply in Switzerland from 2013. With this in mind, a further strengthening of the capital situation and – in conjunction with this – a further realignment of the business model in order to achieve sustainable profitability, are still central challenges facing the big banks. The profitability and the capital situation of the banks with a domestic business focus – the cantonal, regional and Raiffeisen banks – were significantly higher in 2009 than the long-term average. The dip in GDP from mid-2008 to mid-2009 has so far barely had any effect on these banks, with the result that the provisioning requirement for credit risk continued at a low level in 2009. Nevertheless, in our estimation, the position of these bank categories is less comfortable than may appear at first glance. First of all, the capital situation of the Raiffeisen banks and the state-guaranteed cantonal banks needs to be put into perspective: the Raiffeisen banks can count the additional funding obligation required of members in the 
2 BIS Review 85/2010 cooperative as capital until the end of 2011, and the cantonal banks are entitled to a reduction in required capital due to the state guarantee. In the absence of these concessions, the capital ratios – particularly for the Raiffeisen banks – would be markedly lower. Second, according to our assessment, the risk exposure of the domestically focused banks is higher now than it was in 2009. For one thing, the interest rate risk of cantonal and Raiffeisen banks is at historically high levels. For another, the sharp increase in loan volumes – especially for mortgages – against a backdrop of persistent economic uncertainty and the substantial rise in real estate prices points to higher credit risk. In addition, for first mortgages on residential properties, banks are required to have less capital backing under Basel II than they did under Basel I – before 2007 (i.e. under Basel I), a mortgage had to be backed with 4.0% capital; since then (i.e. under Basel II), that figure is only 2.8%. This not only gives banks an incentive to grant more mortgages, but also enables them to reduce the capital buffer used to absorb loan losses.  In view of the increased interest rate and credit risk, we urge the domestically focused banks to be prudent. They must be prepared for interest rates to rise. Besides the direct effect on the interest rate margin, particular attention also needs to be given to the indirect effect of an interest rate increase, namely that if loans are granted without sufficient attention being paid to borrowers’ financial situations, a rise in the interest rate will inevitably result in higher loan losses. As I have mentioned, the domestically focused banks are well capitalised by historical standards. But in view of the risks and uncertainty, they will also need to maintain a large capital buffer. The jump in domestic mortgage lending and in property prices in an environment of historically low interest rates prompted us in the first quarter of this year to conduct a survey among the major banks in the Swiss mortgage industry. We must not forget the lessons learned from previous crises. The property bubble of the 1990s, with its dire consequences for the Swiss banking sector, but also the most recent example – the sub-prime crisis – serve to remind us that adverse developments in the mortgage market can threaten the stability of the banking system, and are thus deserving of the Swiss National Bank’s (SNB) fullest attention. The results of the survey give no cause to sound the all-clear. These may show that there was no relaxation of internal lending standards by the banks between 2005 and 2009, but for banks with a significant overall market share these standards lack conservatism. More than a few banks, for instance, are determining the affordability of a mortgage loan based on an interest rate which is at a historically low level. In addition, based on statements made by survey participants, in practice, deviations from internal lending standards occur frequently: banks with a market share of almost 25% reported such “exceptions to policy” for more than 20% of new mortgage loans granted in 2009. Furthermore, the banks provided only incomplete data on their actual lending practices. This could be a sign that some banks are inadequately informed of the risks in their mortgage portfolios.  The SNB is treating this issue as a high priority, and will continue to monitor the mortgage market carefully. We will analyse the risks in greater detail – in close cooperation with FINMA and the banks themselves – and examine whether there is a need for action. In any case, caution should be exercised in lending. When assessing affordability, it must be taken into account that interest rates are, by historical standards, exceptionally low. It is essential that loan-to-value ratios be set conservatively, especially for regions and property types that have seen prices rise sharply in recent years.  Outlook We expect the global economy to continue recovering this year. This recovery, however, is fragile, for it has until now been based largely on the support measures deployed by governments and central banks. Uncertainty is still at an above-average level. Downside risks have gone up again in recent months due to the financing difficulties faced by some 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 European countries. Urgently needed cost-cutting measures and rising risk premia could jeopardise the recovery and trigger another lengthy period of higher credit default rates, and even renewed turbulence on the financial markets. A development of this kind would present the Swiss banking sector with a serious challenge: besides an economic slowdown and a slump in the financial markets, a further destabilising influence could be the spread of problems throughout the global banking system. Thus indirect risks pose a serious threat to Swiss banks, even if direct risks – measured by the direct claims on those countries particularly affected until now – are moderate. In this climate, it seems inappropriate to us that banks increase their appetite for risk. Reforming the regulatory framework / “too big to fail” A year ago, we emphasised the urgency of alleviating the “too big to fail” issue. Where do we stand today? Allow me to state clearly right now: the “too big to fail” issue will not resolve itself. Last year, the big banks significantly reduced their balance sheets – a move explicitly welcomed by the SNB. The “too big to be rescued” issue has thus also receded somewhat. However, there has been hardly any alleviation of the “too big to fail” issue. Big bank liabilities, which at the end of 2008 were still almost six times Swiss GDP, were reduced by the end of 2009 to just over four times GDP. Nevertheless, the big banks’ share of markets relevant to the Swiss economy – and hence their systemic importance – remains just as high as before: the big banks grant a third of domestic loans and hold a third of domestic deposits. In other words, Switzerland is still vulnerable, and the need for action remains great. This opinion is shared by the commission of experts appointed by the Federal Council on “Limiting the economic risks posed by large companies”, of which I am Vice Chairman. It is the commission’s assessment that in their current form and size, the big banks are clearly systemically important. The commission of experts published its interim report at the end of April. The “too big to fail” issue is to be addressed through a package of key measures encompassing special requirements for systemically important banks in the areas of capital, liquidity and organisational structure. These key measures are compatible with the approach discussed by the Financial Stability Board. Besides those proposed by the commission of experts, other measures being considered at the international level include the breaking-up of big banks, the prohibition of certain activities such as proprietary trading, and the taxation of balance sheets and transactions. The SNB fully supports the proposals put forward by the commission of experts to date. The overall direction is correct. What is important now are the details of the measures. Our position is clear. It is essential that capital requirements be significantly increased and that they rise in line with the degree of systemic importance of a bank. This is the only way to ensure that the banks internalise the risks which, until now, they have been able to pass on to the general public, to some extent. Moreover, progressive capital requirements should create an incentive for banks to reduce their systemic importance, with its associated risk potential.  Allow me to point out that the tightening of capital regulations and the introduction of a leverage ratio that occurred at the end of 2008 were not aimed at reducing the systemic importance of the big banks to an acceptable level. These measures were much more a response to regulatory shortcomings revealed by the recent crisis, which were insufficiently conservative backing of risk with capital (particularly in the trading book) and the lack of a countercyclical component in capital requirements. As regards more stringent liquidity requirements for systemically important banks, specific measures have already been implemented. The liquidity requirements have been thoroughly revised by FINMA and the SNB in collaboration with the big banks, and will come into effect at the end of this month. The final key measure, which is aimed at organisational structure, is also important. The organisation and legal structure of systemically important banks must be adapted to ensure 
4 BIS Review 85/2010 that an orderly liquidation is possible should it become necessary. In particular, it must be possible for systemically important functions to be maintained without the bank as a whole having to be rescued. Clearly, this is not easy to achieve. The implementation of this measure must take into account the challenges posed by the considerable complexity and cross-border activities of the big banks. It must be credible and robust – both operationally and legally. An unworkable approach in this area could have fatal consequences in the next crisis.  The SNB will continue pushing hard for a genuine alleviation of the “too big to fail” issue. We are confident that the banks in the commission of experts will continue to cooperate constructively on achieving a solution. We are aware that, for the big banks, the regulatory measures being discussed are associated with costs. However, first of all, these costs are primarily a reflection of the fact that a subsidy in the form of a de facto “too big to fail” guarantee will be reduced. Yet since the cost to the taxpayer is reduced to the same extent, this does not constitute a cost to the economy as a whole. And second, alternative measures, such as the prohibition of business activities, would be associated with considerably higher costs for the banks. In addition, we are convinced that, in the long term, the big banks will also benefit from more stringent regulatory requirements. The most recent crisis showed that a stable financial system is a basic prerequisite for the long-term competitiveness of our financial centre. This is particularly true of wealth management, an important line of business for Swiss banks. Consequently, an appropriate solution to the “too big to fail” issue in Switzerland could strengthen our banking system in the long term and ensure that it is well placed strategically. 
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: Nakuru as a financial actor and upcoming currency centre Keynote speech by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, to the Nakuru Business Association, Nakuru, 11 June 2010. *      *      * Hon. Lee Kinyanjui, Assistant Minister for Roads and MP for Nakuru Town; His Worship the Mayor, Councillor John Kitilit; The Regional Commissioner, Central Rift, Mr. Amos Gathecha; The District Commissioner, Nakuru, Mr. Kangethe Thuku; Mr. Boniface K. Muhia, Chairman, Nakuru Business Association; Mr. Thomas Kaberi, Chief Executive Officer, Nakuru Business Association; Governing Council Members; Business Leaders; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: I am pleased to join Nakuru Business Association in this meeting. I am here today because I was extremely impressed with the areas of interest to the businessmen and women of Nakuru that I was asked to address. This is quite timely with the support the business community was given by the Minister for Finance in the Budget presentation yesterday. Nakuru being centrally located in Kenya has the potential of achieving a higher growth rate than other towns based on its locational advantage. I was asked to talk to you today on broadly two topical issues; Nakuru as a financial actor and the upcoming currency centre in Nakuru, that will contribute to ease of doing business. But I will want to pick a few important additions from the budget policies read yesterday. Ladies and Gentlemen: Under Vision 2030, Kenya aspires to become an international financial hub. In this regard, I am aware that efforts are currently underway towards the realisation of this objective. On the same note, it may be a high time to consider establishing smaller financial enclaves within Kenya as we build towards the aspired international status. We do know that expanding cities and towns increases productivity growth and overall hinterland growth. As a result, the thought by Nakuru Business Association of making Nakuru a financially vibrant town is not misplaced. What you need to do is to concretize your ideas into a plan of course drawn from the Vision 2030, and to expand the city to provide a diversified economy. To assist in this line, it is necessary to know what the prerequisites of a strong financial town are; several factors have been cited as being prerequisites, however, the paramount prerequisites include:  Financial infrastructure: Banks, Insurance, brokerage firms, outlets, agents etc;  Adequate human resource skills and a flexible labour market;  A transparent and effective regulatory framework;  A critical mass of vertically integrated financial institutions in one location operating in a conducive business environment; and  Observing rules of the game. As Nakuru aspires to become a vibrant financial town, you will need to assess whether the prerequisites indicated above exist and if not what steps need to be taken to put them in place. All the prerequisites can only be put in place with a unity of purpose among all stakeholders. 
2 BIS Review 85/2010 Ladies and Gentlemen: The linkage of any form of business and banking need not be overemphasized. Business and banking complement each other. The banks’ role of financial intermediation takes place through various forms. As banks allocate resources (mainly deposits), they focus on productive sectors of the economy whose potential to default is minimal. This demonstrates the fact that economic growth can only be achieved through efficient resource mobilization and allocation in the economy. Banks are bestowed with the ability to undertake this function. They collate savings and deposits from micro-savers to investors. They allow access to finance where their customers accumulate capital through savings and affordable credit. However, resource mobilization and allocation is not an end in themselves. Economic growth can only be realised if businesses efficiently utilise the resource towards the desired results. The financial sector is therefore in place to encourage a cycle of savings and investment. Credit risks are declining as witnessed by declining non-performing loans in banks. We need to take advantage of this. Over the last ten years, the trend has drastically changed with a continued drop in the level of non-performing loans from as high as 38 percent of gross advances in 2002 to 7 percent as at March 2010. This is an indication of improved resource management in Kenyan businesses and perhaps the efficiency of screening and monitoring the role the banks have invested in. Ladies and Gentlemen: Over the last 5 years, Kenya has witnessed significant growth in the outreach of Kenyan banks. The number of bank branches have increased from 534 in 2005 to 996 in 2009; a growth of 87 percent. The increase is mainly attributed to intense competition among banks and their desire to venture into new territories which are deemed unsaturated. Banks have also seen the benefit of banking the unbanked and removing barriers to entry. Nakuru has greatly benefited from this expansion. Over the period, the number of bank branches in Nakuru has increased from 18 in 2006 to 27 in 2009 but even more in its hinterland. This increase explains the prevailing business potential in Nakuru town and its environs. The increase in the number of banks in Nakuru is in line with Central Bank’s desire of promoting financial inclusion. As per the Financial Access Survey of June 2009, only 23 percent of the Kenyan population aged above 18 years is banked. This state of affairs is not acceptable and we expect the level to increase significantly by the year 2012 given the various efforts Central Bank and its partners have put in. These include:  The licensing of deposit taking microfinance institutions, whose focus is the lower end of the market, which is concentrated in the rural and peri-urban areas.  The licensing of credit reference bureaus, which provides an opportunity for individuals and businesses to rely on their information capital as an alternative form of collateral unlike the traditional physical collateral, to secure credit facilities from banks.  Approval for banks to engage third parties to provide certain banking services. We believe that this will further increase the outreach of banks to most corners of the country.  Flexible space for banks to roll out very incentivised products using the available technological platforms.  Currency centres to reduce costs of doing business. Ladies and Gentlemen: The increase in the number of banks in Nakuru is an indication that the town is in the process of developing the requisite infrastructure necessary to support the activities of the banks. Banks have probably been attracted to Nakuru by its uniqueness of being both an agricultural, tourism and industrial town. Institutions of higher learning have also not been left behind in realizing the potential of Nakuru to create adequate employment 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 opportunities for their graduates. Partnerships between businesses and such institutions of learning is one of the surest ways of developing relevant professionals to contribute to the town’s growth. Nakuru is thus ready for a vibrant business centre and to serve its hinterland. Ladies and Gentlemen: Allow me now to move on to my second point which is the upcoming currency centre in Nakuru. The cash based nature of our economy cannot be overemphasized. The Central Bank has therefore been reviewing the currency management mechanism to ensure availability of “clean money” at a reasonable cost to Kenyans. The Bank, in conjunction with the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA) has embarked on the establishment of currency centres. These centres are expected to reduce the operational costs incurred by banks in moving cash to and from the existing Central Bank branches. This move is also expected to support the provision of “clean” notes and coins to Kenyans across the country. In conjunction with KBA, CBK identified Nyeri, Meru and Nakuru as the appropriate towns to pilot currency centres. The Nyeri currency centre is already operational and progress towards establishing the Nakuru currency centre are at advanced stages. We expect the Nakuru currency centre to commence operations by end of July 2010. This centre will be housed by KCB. Besides benefitting Nakuru residents by getting clean notes and coins, it is expected that the costs saved by banks from the lower transportation costs will translate to better, cost effective and efficient services to the customers. I must emphasize that the centres are a joint partnership between the Central Bank and commercial banks via KBA. The centres should therefore not be confused with the Central Bank’s operated branches. In the case of currency centers, commercial banks provide the physical infrastructure while CBK provides the necessary human and technical support necessary. In the long run, the CBK will leave currency distribution to be handled by commercial banks. Finally, let me touch on three issues that featured in the budget and I think they are critical to our discussions today:  The revamping of investment in infrastructure – Complement private investment – Public investment to reduce cost of doing business – Residue binging constraints  Empowering the youth to secure a future  SME support through a revolving fund operated by bank on a 1 to 5 basis: that is, at the minimum this revolving fund will operate on “for each 1 shilling the government brings, banks will contribute 5 shillings” Ladies and Gentlemen: As I wind down my remarks, I urge all businesses in Nakuru to take advantage of the current trend of falling interest rates to fully exploit the potential of your businesses. The capacity of Kenyan banks to extend credit to all types of businesses has been increased following the increase in the statutory minimum core capital from Ksh.250 million to Ksh.1 billion. The increase took effect from 1st January 2009 and will progressively be increased to Ksh.1 billion by 31st December 2012. The increase was informed by the increasing demand for funding from the banks beyond what they could accommodate based on their capital levels. I also take this opportunity to urge all of you to exercise your rights while engaging with the banks. You must demand to be charged a fair interest rate commensurate to your businesses risk profile investment proposals. This is the only way we can succeed in 
4 BIS Review 85/2010 reducing the cost of credit and also grow your business. There is no other opportune moment for all businesses including banks to realise that success is sweeter when all players prosper and success begets success. With these remarks, ladies and gentlemen, it now remains for me to wish all the businessmen and women in Nakuru success in their endeavours towards prosperity of their businesses. Successes of your businesses will directly contribute towards our desired economic growth of becoming a middle income country as envisaged in Vision 2030. Thank you and God bless you all. 
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Benny Popoitai: Prospects for development and economic growth in the new decade Address by Mr Benny Popoitai, Deputy Governor (Regulations) of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, to the Papua New Guinea–Australian Business Council Forum, Townsville, Queensland, Australia, 16–18 May 2010. *      *      * Papua New Guinea (PNG) Minister for foreign affairs, Honourable Sam Abal, MP, Australian High Commissioner to PNG, His Excellency High Commissioner Mr. Ian Kemish, PNG’s High Commissioner to Australia, His Excellency High Commissioner Mr. Charles Lepani, the two presidents of the Australia-PNG Business Council, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I wish to thank the organizers for having invited the Bank of PNG, particularly the Governor, to make a presentation at this forum. I pass the Governor’s apology for not being able to make it to the forum due to other commitments. I am standing in for him.  In the Bank of PNG’s Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) of 31st March 2010, the Governor outlined the monetary policy stance the Bank will pursue in the first half of this year and the medium term. Two points were stressed: that the Bank, in its application of monetary policy, will carefully assess and evaluate the trade-off between higher economic growth and inflation so as not to discourage domestic economic activity and ensure inflation does not spiral out of control; and that only prudent fiscal management of the windfall revenue from the LNG project and close cooperation and coordination between the Central Bank and the Government will make it possible for monetary policy to address inflationary concerns in 2010 and the medium term when the private sector will be driving economic growth. These will ensure that macroeconomic stability is maintained, which in turn will provide the foundation for Papua New Guinea to fully utilize and Papua New Guineans to use all the opportunities the development of the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project is offering.  Today, my presentation will be on: 1. The lessons we can learn from our history on economic management;  2. Current State of the Economy;  3. What are the development prospects of the construction and operation of a LNG project?; and  4. What should be done to ensure that this time around we achieve our development objectives?  1. The lessons we can learn from our history on economic management  As we all know, history can be a good teacher if we are willing to learn from it.  The Government’s expansionary fiscal policy and its reliance on monetary policy for debt management, during the period between the outbreak of the Bougainville conflict in 1989 and 1999 resulted in what can be best defined as the “Lost Decade”. Instead of taking full advantage of the very substantial income flows from the mineral developments and investing them in improving the social areas of health, education, physical infrastructure maintenance and construction of roads, airstrips, sea and river ports to open up the rural areas to markets, and law and order the resources were squandered and wasted. In the early 90’s the misguided policies of the Government of the day by reducing taxes and increasing the recurrent expenditure, at a time when the country was in a major, very costly armed conflict, resulted in the loss of public confidence, a run on the Kina and a state of insolvency after loosing all its foreign exchange reserves.  
2 BIS Review 85/2010 In June 1995 the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments was passed, shifting the fiscal operations of the Government from a centralized to a decentralized model. While well-intended, the change placed a further demand on the very strained resources of the National Government. The transfers of funds from the National Government to the Provincial and Local Level Governments was aimed at funding the transferred functions, in health, education, law and order and infrastructure. While the funds were transferred the functions stayed with the National Government and left unfunded. Not surprising the result was that the social indicators worsened and the infrastructure of the country deteriorated. In some parts of the country they have become unusable.  Looking at the numbers in the “lost decade” after the very strong growth in the 1991 to 1993 period, the rest of the period to 1999 has had an annual decline in growth of negative 1.1% on per annum. The result was that for the whole period from 1989 to 1999, a period when some of Papua New Guinea’s very large mineral developments took place, the per capita growth in GDP was negative 1.6%.  The period from 2000 to 2006 can be defined as a period of consolidation after the restoration of responsible macroeconomic management. Fiscal responsibility was reestablished. The understanding that any increase in public debt places an unsustainable burden on the National Purse was accepted by all policy makers. Even more so, the need for close cooperation and coordination between the fiscal operations of the Government at all levels and monetary policy management, the sole responsibility of an independent Central Bank with a clearly stated prime objective of Price Stability, are the necessary conditions for a long term broad based economic development and growth. The annual growth in GDP was 2.62% and with an annual population growth rate of 2.83%, the per capita growth in GDP was negative 0.0021% per annum. It is within the range of the statistical error, and therefore it is zero. This is still a poor performance but it is an improvement from the 1990s.  It is only in the last three years, 2007 to 2009, that we have had an overall growth in GDP of 21.5% or a per annum growth of 6.6% and a per capita growth rate of 3.77% per annum.  The conclusions are very clear. In the thirty four years of our independence, we have failed in the overall objective to increase the standard of living and well-being of the great majority of our people. The statistical information we have shows that for the whole period the per capita income declined by around 4% and social indicators indicate a dismal performance, this with two periods of very strong GDP growth, the first at the mineral boom in 1991 to 1993 driven by the construction and increase in the volume of exports from Misima, Porgera and Kutubu and the second from 2006 to 2009 driven by unprecedented price increases of oil, copper and gold.  2. Current state of the economy  Papua New Guinea has, over the last 7 years, with a blip in 2009, benefited significantly from the export commodity price boom as it resulted in fiscal surpluses, record international reserve levels, reduced total public debt and sustained real GDP growth. The financial sector reform, which commenced in 2000, contributed to a sound and prudently managed financial system and aided economic growth.  The sound and prudent management of our financial institutions is reflected by the high capital adequacy ratios, a liquid banking system, low level of non-performing loans, and funding of loans by the banking system from deposits rather than from borrowings from overseas. The Central Bank authorized financial institutions also remained highly profitable. A further testament of the sound financial system was when the economy withstood the global financial crisis. Through good management our financial institutions had less exposure to the troubled markets and institutions abroad.  Prudent monetary and fiscal policies between 2003 and 2009, with the exception of 2008, and a co-ordinated approach in their management also contributed to stable exchange rates 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 and price stability (low inflation in the single digits) and improved confidence in the domestic economy. Together with the low interest rate environment, this led to a significant increase in lending to the private sector, with a growth of between 30–40 percent during the period. The removal of foreign exchange controls, particularly on lending to non resident companies also supported the strong growth.  We are still in the second boom with a blip in 2008, as a result of the Global Financial Crisis followed by a depression in the developed countries that, led to economic problems all around the world. Price stability was achieved and maintained from 2004 to 2009, with the exception of 2008 and first half of 2009, due to high international food and fuel prices, which were beyond PNG’s control. There was also prudent fiscal management in this period, except for 2008.  While it is too early to judge the outcome, we can point toward some improvements mainly in the formal structures. The Government has a Medium Term Development Strategy document 2005–2010, which has yet to be updated, a Medium Term Fiscal Strategy Document  2008–2012, enacted the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2006, and formulated the Development Strategic Plan 2010–2030, and the Papua New Guinea Vision 2050. These can serve as the framework for a clearly defined objective, which can be assumed to be, a Broad Based Economic Growth as measured by GDP, underpinned by a greater participation of and benefit for the rural people.  3. What are the development prospects of the construction and operation of a LNG Project?  The development prospects of the LNG project should be looked upon in two stages – construction and operation (production).  A. The construction stage  The construction stage will last three to four years, to the end of 2013 or even 2014. The size of this project at a total expenditure of US$ 15 to US$ 16 billion is huge by all standards. Just to give some general measures, the expenditure is 1.8 times the estimated nominal GDP of Papua New Guinea. It is far beyond what the country experienced in the past mineral developments and a magnitude that at least I don’t know if there is a precedent of it in any other country. If we assume that construction will last for four years, every year the developer will spend the equivalent of 45% of the 2009 nominal GDP.  A large portion of the expenditure will be on imported goods and services, paid from funds held off shore while, some of the goods and services will be purchased on shore, with funds to be brought in from off shore. The size of the project coupled with the very strong impact it will have on domestic economic activity will facilitate activity in the other sectors of the economy such as food production in agriculture, manufacturing, building and construction, and transportation. Those who will act for the LNG project will be paid by the developer converting foreign exchange into Kina, which will have the effect of an appreciated kina. The increase in imports to accommodate increase in economic activity in other sectors will have the effect of a depreciated kina. These opposite effects could balance each other out and result in a stable kina exchange rate. But this will depend on the magnitude of flows from each side. Even if the reserves might decline as a result of the imports by other sectors that are not for the project development, it will be marginal. The Bank of Papua New Guinea has sufficient reserves to ensure that it has minimal impact on the exchange rate and through it on inflation.  While it is expected that there will be very strong growth in economic activity during the construction phase, high demand for goods and service will have some inflationary effect. To ensure that there is economic growth while inflation is not too high, the Government has to follow some clearly designed policies.  
4 BIS Review 85/2010 The developer is constructing a huge infrastructure corridor from the Southern Highlands to Port Moresby. They will construct roads, a pipeline, bring in electricity, telecommunication, and meet social-community commitments in the villages where the corridor is passing through. The country’s production capacity will be used far beyond its availability. The Government is therefore advised not to undertake any major infrastructure development project during the construction years of the project and not increase its general expenditure. It should instead concentrate its efforts on maintaining and improving the existing infrastructure that deteriorated in some areas to an unusable state.  The added advantage will be that all the resources of the Government can be concentrated on the priority areas of education, health, conservation of the environment and law and order.  In these three to four years the Government should undertake a full detailed review of its development agenda. All sacred cows should be slaughtered.  1. It should re visit the decentralization of Government responsibilities and review the Organic Law on Provincial and Local Level Governments to streamline channels of funding mechanism for rural areas;  2. It should clearly define what Government should and should not do. What should be fully privatized, what should be done by Public, Private Partnership, and what functions and roles should be abolished for enhancement and efficiency in service delivery;  3. It should set out clearly defined targets for social indicators in health, education, law and order and conservation of the environment; and  4. It should prioritize the infrastructure projects it will implement after the resources used by the developer become available when the construction phase ends. The Government should work out detailed plans for the highly skilled local contractors working on the LNG infrastructure, so that following the completion of the construction stage, it will use the resources elsewhere. This will ensure that there is no crowding out of the private sector and the benefit of using highly qualified contractors and workforce, to implement a long term infrastructure development framework can become a reality.  We at the Bank of Papua New Guinea also have to work on several matters during the construction phase of the project. These are:  1. The development and implementation of a national payments systems that will be geared toward dealing with instruments of a fully developed country with all the payment mechanisms used in today’s world;  2. Ensure that financial services are available to the people “unbanked population” wherever they are, through developing the Microfinance industry and the rural banking facilities by all the banks and financial institutions operating in the country, telephone, including mobile phone and internet banking;  3. Enhancing competition in the banking and finance industry through licensing of new foreign exchange dealers such as FIFL, licensing of more micro banks such as the two new ones recently and licensing of Post PNG to do international remittances;  4. Expanding the banking services and products on offer by the banks in the domestic and foreign exchange markets; and  5. Creating a competitive environment to ensure that the people enjoy the best and lowest cost services, that a stable and prudently managed banking system can offer.  I will move now to the last part of my address. 
BIS Review 85/2010 5 4. What should be done to ensure that this time around we achieve our development objectives?  B. The production and operations stage of the LNG project As I already said the three years 2006 to 2009 Papua New Guinea enjoyed a second mineral boom driven by high gold, copper and oil prices. The Government learned some of the lessons of the failure of the first boom in the 1990’s and took measures not to repeat the same mistakes. It decided to use some of the excess revenue to repay domestic and off shore debt. This is equivalent to a Future Generation Fund. Reducing debt today reduces the burden on future generations when the debt becomes due.  It also decided to place some of the excess revenue in trust accounts to be used as a stabilization fund. This decision has had some flaws, the first is that the use of the funds were not tightly controlled and regulated by law. The second is that the funds were deposited with the commercial banks at a very low interest rate, and the Bank of Papua New Guinea has had to defuse them to ensure that the excess liquidity will not result in very high inflation, by using Central Bank Bills (CBB’s), at a much higher interest rate cost to the benefit of the commercial banks. Just to give some indication of the magnitude of the cost to the Government and the people, the interest rate paid on the trust accounts by the commercial banks were bellow 1%, while the CBB’s were placed at 5% and higher, and only this year it has come down to 4%. The amounts were very large, at the peak the trust accounts reached close to K4.6 billion and the CBB’s issued were K4 billion. Every one of us can see how costly this was to the Government and the people of Papua New Guinea.  The third problem was that most of the trust accounts were aimed to be spent on development projects and there was and still is very limited implementation capacity, that result in non-efficient use of the funds and in some cases some of the funds were misused.  The fourth and last issue I want to point out is the trust accounts offered a stabilization potential. They could be drawn down when the revenues decline. When it came to the test in the sharp decline of the commodity prices in 2008, it did not work. The Government incurred a relatively large deficit of K 479 million, which as expected has had an inflationary impact that resulted in a two digit level inflation of 11.2%.  The generally accepted paradigm by the Government and the Bank of Papua New Guinea is that, a very responsible fiscal management, which aims at a balanced budget, or at the worst case at a very low deficit, and a complementary monetary management with the main objective of price stability, defined as low inflation levels, which is a necessary condition for a long term, sustainable economic growth. If properly done, this can benefit the great majority of the population, living in the rural areas. For the Bank’s part, we realize that with the first LNG project and the likelihood of more LNG projects, the economy will enter a new era of economic growth. In its formulation and conduct of monetary policy the Bank will carefully assess and evaluate the trade-off between higher economic growth and inflation so as not to discourage domestic economic activity and ensure inflation does not spiral out of control. It is very encouraging that the National Executive Council (NEC) decided to set up a joint working group of very senior staff from the Department Treasury and the Bank of Papua New Guinea to asses and evaluate the applicability of the Sovereign Wealth Fund model, to prepare the country toward the times that the LNG project will move into the operation stage of production and export.  All the expectations are that when the LNG project will move to the operation stage, the country will benefit from very large taxation, dividend, and royalty incomes. It is of outmost importance that the mistakes of the late 1980’s and 1990’s are not repeated. The Working Group is consulting with all the stake holders and get the best available advice, from domestic and international experts, to come up with the best structures known at the present to deal with large foreign exchange inflows.  
6 BIS Review 85/2010 The last thing we should do is not to preempt the Working Group’s deliberations and recommendations. The whole Nation has a very strong interest and a lot at stake and we want to ensure that they come up with the best possible solutions to the two subjects they deal with; the stabilization of the fiscal operations of the Government and the Savings for Future Generations, from a project of immense size and importance to the future wellbeing of all our nation.  The Government in close cooperation and consultation with all economic sectors and civil society, has the time to carefully formulate, and design the implementation tools and mechanisms of its development strategies and plans, to ensure that we commence an era of high economic activity and growth for the nation’s future generations.  Thank you. 
BIS Review 84/2010 1 Christian Noyer: Sovereign crisis, risk contagion and the response of the central bank Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France and Chairman of the  Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Global Interdependence Centre (GIC) Conferences, Paris, 17 June 2010. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am very much honored to open this second session of conferences in Paris and I would like to thank the Global Interdependence Centre for having Banque de France as a partner of this full week conference. I will give the point of view of a central banker on the recent events on sovereign markets, the major implied risks and challenges for financial stability and the recovery process. Finally, I will briefly touch on the latest actions of central banks and public authorities to contain those renewed tensions.  I am confident that this opening address will give rise to valuable discussions in the panels where distinguished speakers will express views from different perspectives: central banks, rating agencies, investors and academia. Sovereign crisis: origins and dynamics The sovereign debt turmoil is the most recent episode of a crisis that started more than two years ago yet. Some European States are the latest actors of a protracted debt crisis after i) US subprime mortgage borrowers, ii) financial institutions with weak funding situation and iii) non financial companies and households unable to finance their capital needs. It reminds us, if need be, that crisis management is always a difficult and potentially long lasting task. Time is a key dimension for fixing the economic and financial systems, which in turn creates the conditions for self sustained recoveries. In a couple of weeks, Greece has been at the epicenter of the phenomenon when doubts about the ability of its government to honor billions of debts maturing in 2010 became widespread. The lack of market confidence translated into spectacular increases in government bond yields. While this extreme situation was largely limited to one Member State, the magnitude of these price movements and signs of contagion to other sovereigns led market participants to fully reassess global sovereign risks. In this global reassessment process even less vulnerable countries were broadly and suddenly impacted with spreads widening very rapidly and reaching sometimes unprecedented levels. The issue at stake is certainly not to refute weaknesses of certain fiscal positions. In fact I, and many ECB Governing Council members alike have regularly called on policy makers to pay due attention to debt dynamics. What was very peculiar was the intensity of contagion between member states and between segments of the financial markets. Some observers have voiced concerns that specific mechanisms were at play, highlighting the potential destabilizing role of speculation and called for decisive policy actions to curb its consequences. I will come back to this issue later on.  Looking at the roots of these countries weaknesses, the financial crisis has played a pivotal role. Of course, the structural fiscal deficit of certain countries were already sizeable before the crisis occurred but the crisis has triggered a huge deterioration of public finance situations: first via the mechanism of automatic stabilizers that resulted in rapidly declining fiscal receipts due to the global and synchronized recession; second the imbalances of public accounts have been aggravated by greater public spending via unprecedented fiscal stimuli 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 plans but also large public financial commitments, in particular via capital injection into the banking sector and debt guarantees schemes. Public interventions have been massive to contain the scale of the turmoil but in return have implied a cost and led to a transfer of risk out of the banking sector onto the public sector balance sheet. For instance, interventions from European governments amounted to about 1800 billion EUR or 14% of the European GDP.  The potential contagion channels of the April-May European crisis What are the reasons behind the strong and unambiguous public authorities’ responses to the April-May crisis? As already shown in the previous stages of the financial crisis, strong and prompt public actions are needed to prevent contagion and undesirable second round effects. In that respect, properly handling this sovereign debt crisis is absolutely necessary, lest the shocks on the sovereign debt markets profoundly affect financial markets, banking systems and thus, the real economy. Let me elaborate on these contagion channels.  1) Considered theoretically as risk-free securities, government bonds are usually considered as floor rates and constitute the benchmark for pricing almost all other securities. Thus, rising sovereign yields mechanically shift funding costs upwards for all private agents. Interest rates on government bonds usually include small premia to compensate for liquidity and credit risk. For a proper monetary policy transmission, these risk premia should not reach such level and volatility that the signal from the key policy rates is no longer perceivable and no longer reaches the real economy. In recent months, the tensions rapidly spread to other markets to a point that jeopardized the transmission of monetary policy, as European government bond markets became largely dysfunctional. 2) The second contagion mechanism goes through the banking system.  On the liability side, banks are already suffering from increasing government debt issuance which has a crowding out effect and contribute to steepen the yield curve; it is a real issue as banks debts maturing in the next three years are significant while government support and central banks facilities are expected to be gradually removed. In that tense context, the sovereign debt crisis trigger increasing funding tensions for European banks owing to the contagion of sovereign to banks spreads. It reflects the traditional belief that domestic financial institutions cannot be less risky than the sovereign which are supposed to back them in case of need. Over the past seven months, this fact has been confirmed by the increasingly strong correlation of bank CDS with those of the country where they are located. It is an area of concerns for banks especially in the case of a rapid and abrupt evolution. A surge in the cost of funding will be therefore damaging for banks profitability and their ability to grant credits. Short-term funding may also cause some concerns for banks as multiple sovereign downgrades can lower, either through a decrease in market prices or through an increase in haircuts, the value of government securities used to collateralize refinancing.  On the asset side, banks are exposed to an abrupt drop in sovereign debt prices through mark-to-market losses on sometimes large trading portfolios of government bonds detained as a liquidity buffer. In addition, banks active on CDS as net protection sellers are also exposed to mark-to-market losses and real losses in case of a debt restructuration which constitutes a credit event triggering the CDS. These losses could erode the capital base of the banks at a time when the risk weighting of assets, based on credit rating levels, increases. The two factors push down capital ratios and reduce the potential for lending to the economy.  It brings us to our third contagion channel. 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 3) Lastly, the economic channel is likely to play a significant role via the fiscal adjustments necessary to repair public finances and restore the credibility of the countries on financial markets. The increase in public investment and spending had mainly contributed to the economic growth of the last semesters; their drop could weigh on the recovery even if the calibration and the path of fiscal adjustment are supposed to be fine-tuned to allow a sustainable fiscal consolidation without challenging a long-lasting economic recovery.  Strong and unambiguous responses from European governments and the Eurosystem  In such a context, the role of central banks and public authorities was crucial to restore confidence and ensure a proper functioning of financial markets. Drawing on the lessons learnt from the financial crisis in 2008–09, European governments and the Eurosystem have therefore rapidly resorted to strong, unprecedented and sizeable actions to contain those tensions and prevent their spill over to the real economy. We could briefly mention the actions of the Heads of States and the central banks. Government actions helped contain the pressures 1) I first welcome the commitments from many European countries to strengthen their fiscal position which is a necessary step to restore the credibility of governments and the normalization of sovereign bond markets. As recently pointed out by the G20 Finance Ministers and central bank governors, recent events have highlighted the importance of sustainable public finances : those countries with serious fiscal challenges need to accelerate the pace of fiscal consolidation; 2) Secondly, the announcement of a EUR 110 billion financial aid package for Greece, agreed between the European Commission and the IMF conditioned to a package of substantial fiscal consolidation measures by Greece contributed to alleviate concerns in the markets. 3) Thirdly, to restore confidence in the whole euro area and to contain contagion, a plan with a broader scope has been adopted at the euro area level, the European Financial Stabilization Facility, for a global amount of 750 billion euro with the financial participation of the IMF. One of the key features of this Facility will be the possibility to be used on short notice without involving further national Parliaments.  Finally, let me focus on the other recent actions of the European central bank which have been essential in response to these challenging circumstances.  Central banks complemented these actions by specific and innovated measures  1) After careful consideration of all implications of this option and based on its positive assessment of the Greek consolidation package , the Eurosystem decided to suspend the reference to credit rating and current market prices in the collateral requirements for marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Greek government. This decision proved once again the flexibility of our operational framework and contributed to maintain a normal functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanisms and to mitigate strains on interbank markets. It allowed avoiding strong and potentially pro-cyclical threshold effects of credit rating agency unilateral decisions. 2) Then, the launch of the Securities Markets Programme (SMP) on the 10th of May marked a new step of the Eurosystem’s response to the financial crisis. This measure consists in intervening in the euro area’s public and private securities secondary markets to ensure depth and liquidity in markets that have been affected by severe disruptions. The objective of this program is to address the malfunctioning 
4 BIS Review 84/2010 of securities markets and to restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission mechanism. These interventions were sterilized as liquidity injected was exactly drained, thus fully neutralizing the effects in the banking system. This historical and exceptional type of intervention has stemmed from the spillover of increased financial market volatility, liquidity risks and market dislocations.  3) Additionally, the ECB reactivated, in coordination with other central banks, the temporary liquidity swap lines with the Fed and resumed US dollar liquidity providing operations in order to alleviate pressures on funding in dollar. The reactivation of this measure followed the revival of strains on foreign exchange markets and highlights the central role that cooperation between central banks has taken in recent years in order to preserve cross-border operations and financial stability at the global level.  However while such measures have removed near-term uncertainty, they could prove insufficient to provide a lasting change in the negative sentiment of investors on the medium-term if budget deficits and debt situation are not considerably improved. In this context, European authorities have to show their strong level of cooperation and commitments to global and common solutions. Any unilateral and uncoordinated decision may notably prove to be less efficient and may amplify markets volatility.  Finally, the removal of vulnerabilities in the banking sector is desirable to alleviate uncertainties. Effective risk management, transparency and robust business models are essential to strengthen banks’ resilience to shocks and to ensure adequate funding of real economy that underpins sustainable growth and financial stability. The effective and timely implementation of the G20 policy orientations is necessary to build the new international system on a solid and stable ground. This is notably the case for the G 20 provisions on the CDS market and on credit rating agencies. One cannot deny that certain OTC derivatives (CDS for instance) or certain types of transactions (short sales) are likely to exacerbate price movements or create instability that are detrimental to both issuers and investors. One may thus find it tempting to ban or drastically limit this type of operations and we indeed have observed national proposals going in that direction, including the bank of naked CDS, naked short sales or mandatory shorter time horizon for settling transactions. I am of the view that such measures may not be efficient and, worse, may be counterproductive.  They may not be efficient since security prices are not formed in national contexts but on global markets. What would not be possible in Paris or Frankfurt could still be allowed in London or New York for instance. They may also be counterproductive since they could deter activities away from our market onto others and they could significantly alter the liquidity of securities aimed by the restriction since foreign investors may shy away from them and turn to other opportunities.  Let me be clear, though, this does not mean that nothing should be done. On the contrary, I believe that instead of banning and creating incentives to relocate certain activities elsewhere or circumvent those rules, it is preferable to attract and better supervise. This can be done: - First by integrating OTC markets into regulated and supervised market infrastructures such as trading platforms, trade repositories and CCPs. In the case of sovereign CDS this will mean that all CDS written on euro area sovereigns should be compensated in a CCP located in the euro area. Incidentally, that requires a fair amount of standardization of these single name CDS. - Second, by enhancing transparency, both ex ante and ex post to improve our understanding of the price discovery mechanism and our knowledge of actual net positions of financial institutions.  
BIS Review 84/2010 5 - Finally, by improving risk management by agents active in these markets and ensuring that these practices are compatible with their risk profile. In the case of sovereign CDS, the issue is not necessarily with buyers who ultimately carry limited risks but with sellers. In fact we probably need a specific supervision of credit protection sellers. Regarding credit rating agencies, the agreement on strengthening the regulatory oversight is becoming a reality with the implementation of the agreed European framework, which will give a pivotal role to the European Securities Market Authority. At the same time there is a need to reduce the dependency on credit rating agencies for regulatory purposes, both in prudential regulation and as eligibility criteria for central bank refinancing. ******************************** Let me now conclude briefly. We are still going through very challenging times. The European banking system seemed to have recovered partly thanks to central banks and governments policies supporting the banking sector. This return to profitability should be used to comfort capital positions in those firms, in views of the various risks I have rapidly discussed. Recent renewed strains on financial markets especially sovereign markets and the subsequent impact on the banking sector show us that the crisis is not fully behind us and those central banks actions are more than necessary to accompany the redefinition of the banking sector, the well-functioning of markets and the return to a self-sustainable recovery. So far, the measures taken by the Eurosystem to stabilize markets and restore their functioning, as well as the establishment of the European Financial Stabilization Facility, have lowered tail and contagion risks. But the seeds of recent events have to be addressed to preserve financial stability in the long run. Indeed, sizeable fiscal imbalances remain and governments have to accelerate fiscal consolidation to ensure the sustainability of public finances and to meet conditions conducive to durable economic growth. In parallel, vulnerable financial institutions that remain over-reliant on enhanced credit and government support will have to be tackled decisively.  Thank you very much for your attention. 
BIS Review 84/2010 1 José De Gregorio: Macroeconomics, policymaking and the crisis Keynote speech by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the Bank of Finland and Bank of Italy Conference on Challenges of the Global Crisis to Macroeconomic Theory and International Finance, in honour of Pentti Kouri, Helsinki, 11 June 2010. *      *      * I am grateful for useful discussions and comments from Mariana García and Pablo García. It is an honor to participate in this tribute to Pentti Kouri. I did not have the pleasure to be close to him, but I not only know well who he was and his work, but we also share some things in common. We both study at MIT and did international finance. We were very close to Rudi Dornbusch. There is a group of economists from all over the world, Chile and Finland for example, which had the privilege to work close to him, as students or as colleagues, and to enjoy his unconditional friendship and intellectual influence. In this conference there are a few of this fortunate group. Kouri and Dornbusch had pathbreaking work explaining exchange rate fluctuations as movements of asset prices. Kouri’s papers were always an important reference in our course’s work. By the time I was student, late 80s, reading Kouri’s papers, he was a successful investor living in Connecticut. I remember a couple of times when Rudi told me that he would visit this great friend, economist and successful investor to get some funds for the department. He succeeded, proof of which is that the department now has the Pentti J.K. Kouri Career Development Associate Professor of Economics. Today, rather than attempting to elaborate on Kouri’s contribution, I think this is a good opportunity to address some issues on the state of macroeconomics and policymaking, which is the purpose of the conference, and are two aspects to which Rudi and Pentti contributed a lot. If they were here with us today, their deep insights and provocative ideas, regardless of whether we agreed with them or not, would certainly make us think. Changes in the world economy, macroeconomics, and policymaking More than 30 years after Kouri’s influential work, the world has changed dramatically, and so have economic theory and policymaking, especially in emerging market economies. There is a growing role of markets in the determination of prices, in particular interest rates and exchange rates. There is much greater trade and financial integration, which is a source of greater interdependence cross economies, but is also a source of much greater opportunities for developing countries. Finally, financial markets are much more sophisticated, which is also a source of vulnerabilities and opportunities. There has been also a profound evolution of macroeconomics. Developments, such as rational expectations and dynamic inconsistency, changed the views on what macroeconomic policies could achieve. They were also the basis for the discussion of rules versus discretion, and the general preference for the conduct of policies under flexible rules, or constrained discretion. The possibility of expectational inefficiencies has also become an important insight for policies. Contagion, self-fulfilling prophecies, coordination failures and multiple equilibria, are just some of the phenomena from which market inefficiencies arise, and there are many examples in the real world. However, one has to be careful when the failure of bad policies is attributed to phenomena outside the control of authorities. Many crises that some may want to classify as bad-expectational equilibria are simply the result of bad policies. Indeed, there is no crisis that has struck a country without an associated fundamental problem. What 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 expectational inefficiencies do is that they amplify the probability of occurrence and the cost of crises. Other important development has been the understanding of policymaking, in particular monetary policy, as a rule rather than changes in policy variables without reason. Thus, rather than thinking of changes in the policy variables, it is more realistic to think of changes in the determinants of policies. Finally, we have learned that credibility is central for the effectiveness of policies. All these developments have also led to changes in the way monetary policy is conducted. However, an important caveat has to be made. There is a two-way relationship between theory and policy developments. It would be presumptuous to argue that theory has changed policies. Indeed, the development of inflation targeting came before it was seriously discussed in academic circles. New Zealand implemented its inflation targeting regime in the early 1990s, before the main analytical developments took place. Along the same line, the Taylor rule was, obviously, used before John Taylor estimated it. Regardless causality, monetary policy and central banking have changed significantly. The movement toward granting central bank independence around the world has been a positive one. Of course, this comes with the challenge for central bankers to demonstrate that this is really a good thing, something that certainly has been questioned in some countries during the recent crisis.  Although central banks were created to address problems in the banking sector, over time, their objectives moved to more general aspects such as economic development or growth. Then, since the 1980s, and with the success of the Great Moderation, central banks increasingly, and rightly so, focused on price stability. Unfortunately, financial stability, another issue at the core of central banking, was overlooked. Monetary policy has abandoned money supply and exchange rates as nominal anchors, to target directly inflation and anchoring nominal variables via inflationary expectations. To reinforce credibility and to gain legitimacy, communication has become central to the conduct of monetary policy. Many challenges remain; in particular how to incorporate the financial stability goal into policy making, but the evolution of policy making has been enormous, in particular for emerging economies. However, progress in economics has not been completely successful, and many challenges remain to make economic analysis more helpful to guide policies, and that is the issue I want to discuss next.1 On models and theory Macroeconomics has increasingly moved towards models more rigorously specified, with sound micro-foundations, with all general equilibrium interactions, and explicit informational constraints. However, there will always be tensions between rigor, realism and flexibility. There are many tradeoffs.  The costs of these tradeoffs are often subtle. The tendency to base models on ever more rigorous grounds, although a logical trend, has undesired effects. The incentives for younger academics – the very ones who are supposed to push the borders of knowledge, and who must publish or perish – limit their capabilities for innovation. The required rigor ends up necessarily threatening realism. Nobody expects a model to explain all the complexities of the real world, but the problem is that it can overlook elements that are crucial to understanding and preventing economic disasters like the one we faced some years ago. It                                                  1 For further discussion on these issues, see De Gregorio (2009). 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 may be more rewarding from an academic standpoint to write an equilibrium model explaining some particular phenomenon, than trying to formulate a model that properly represents all the distortions of said phenomenon. It is harder and less rewarding for an academic to formulate distortions – of which the real world has plenty – than to use elegant general equilibrium competitive models to explain important stylized facts with a minimum number of new ingredients. Only a handful of academics are able to think rigorously out of the box, and Kouri was one of them. Complexity also jeopardizes the capacity to move from scientific research to economic policy proposals. For academic ideas to be useful in economic policy making, they must be persuasive. Perhaps that was the virtue of the IS-LM model that was used for many years in macroeconomic policy discussions, or of Solow’s growth model that to this day remains the cornerstone of economic growth analysis. Fortunately, this is not a time where prescriptions are taken by policymakers without scrutiny – and are later labeled as orthodox – and therefore, the capacity to intuitively explain a result is essential. Models are only a part of the reality that allows us to organize our ideas before diagnosing and prescribing. The arguments’ logic and a good deal of judgment are also critical when it comes to making economic policy decisions. Indeed, the current crisis has revealed that models have a limited ability to deal with all the complexities of the real world. Even current state-of-the-art DSGE models, used in many central banks, have been unable to consider in a manageable and explicit way all the intricacies associated with financial markets’ distortions and imperfect arbitrage, let alone the existence of default and credit losses.  This brings me to the theory of finance. If there ever was one discipline that should have anticipated the vulnerabilities that were building up in financial markets, it was finance. Had the origin of the problem been inflationary, then the problem would have been macroeconomics, but the origin was financial.2 The origin of the crisis was closely related to financial innovation and the creation of instruments that should have diversified risks. Most of financial innovation was used to circumvent regulation, allowing credit expansion with a weak capital base. Low interest rates, search for yields and a monetary policy that promised to rescue after severe falls in asset prices prompted the creation of a housing bubble. Enormous efforts were made to price many extremely complex financial instruments, but even those efforts failed to build valuation models that realistically considered the instruments’ insolvency probabilities. No evidence is necessary to assert that these methods failed because of an extreme event that struck everything. These failures were exacerbated by severe liquidity shortages and widespread panic in the markets. It is paradoxical that while asset price theories, and their application to the real world, are based on the existence of full arbitrage (consider, for example, the CAPM), corporate finance theories are essentially dominated by information asymmetries and are plagued by frictions from principal-agent problems. This dichotomy will have to be corrected over time to ensure that more realistic models of how financial markets work become available, models which will shed more light on economic policy recommendations. On crisis prevention and management A pervasive question for the past and current crises is whether they could have been anticipated. On the one hand, it is tautological to say that crises are unpredictable, or else                                                  2 It is out of the scope of this presentation to discuss the role of monetary policy in causing the crisis. As I have argued elsewhere (De Gregorio, 2010), the cause of the crisis was mainly financial fragility, while lax monetary policy played only a secondary role. Many countries, such as Chile or Canada, for example, had very expansionary policy before the crisis, and did not suffer a financial collapse. 
4 BIS Review 84/2010 they would never occur. History is plagued with crises. Moreover, crises have become more frequent in recent decades as compared with the Bretton-Woods period, although their severity and duration have not changed significantly (Bordo et al., 2001). Crises must be avoided, but the only way to make sure they do not happen is to eliminate financial innovation and development altogether, which we know is not a good prescription. Therefore, crises will still occur, and the role of policies is not to be the cause of them, but to increase resilience of financial systems and minimize their cost.3 Of course, all these elements were absent in the global financial crisis and for this reason we need to devote more thinking to reforms. Although crises will continue to happen, we must not conclude that since crises are unavoidable, there is nothing we can do about them. Instead, the proper way to act is to strengthen the financial system and macroeconomic policies, in order to minimize their probability of occurrence and their consequences, and to set up a proper crisis-management strategy once they hit.  As in the case of natural disasters, or accidents, the fact that crises will continue to happen does not mean that we must allow no regulation of economic activities (such as building codes, or driving standards). Countries with better building codes are better at facing earthquakes. In the case of financial crises, it is reasonable to improve regulatory mechanisms, particularly to allow financial innovation while keeping vulnerability at bay.  Meanwhile, it is necessary to continue devoting efforts to the detection of early alerts, although unambiguous indicators are impossible to find. But there are symptoms of fragility, very common in emerging economies. High and persistent current-account deficits, misaligned exchange rates, currency mismatches in the financial and corporate sectors, excessive increases in the prices of assets and credit, all signal a potential problem, although they do not necessarily result in a crisis. Therefore, a look at the indicators is not enough; it is important to put them together to detect fragilities. This is precisely what we try to do in our financial stability reports, which allow us to gain an overall vision of vulnerabilities, although, once again, it does not provide a final verdict.  Final remarks The world has gone through the worst crisis since the Great Depression. The initial shock on the global economy did not differ much from the one that hit in the 1930s. There were many similarities between the Great Depression and the Great Recession. Worth noting are the initial fall in manufacturing output and trade, the collapse of stock prices and credit, and the increase in bond spreads (see Eichengreen and O’Rourke, 2010). These remarkable similarities in the first months of the crisis were alarming. The questioning of the profession was also worrisome. However, the subsequent evolution of the global economy was quite different from that of the Great Depression, and it was certainly the result of good macroeconomic management. There was a failure in crisis prevention, but the policy response has been good so far. More remarkable has been the response of emerging market economies. In particular, Latin America, a region that historically magnified the global cycle, this time will perform better than the world economy’s average. The world has still many macroeconomic problems to solve before we can declare victory. Indeed the same policies that averted a collapse require careful review to avoid planting the seeds for the next crisis.                                                  3 On this issue, Rancière et al. (2008) find that “countries that have experienced occasional financial crises have on average grown faster than countries with stable financial systems”. 
BIS Review 84/2010 5 First, there is a need to think seriously about moral hazard. It is true that during the crisis this was a second order problem. But, in the gestation of asset price bubbles there was the commitment that if and when the bubble burst, the Fed would take care of the mess. This is exactly the same as the build up of currency mismatches in emerging markets when authorities promise to ensure exchange rate stability. In addition, we have witnessed a messy bail out of banks, and more recently, and more worrisome, bail out of countries with weak public finances. The issue of sustainability has become very relevant, in particular on the fiscal sphere. Economies cannot live forever beyond their means, and a serious effort of fiscal consolidation must be made, in particular in fragile industrial economies. It is ironic that after going through a very complex financial crisis, we are now worried about a very traditional crisis, caused by fiscal imbalances in the context of a fixed exchange rate regime, with potentially serious financial ramifications. The type of crisis that was analyzed and modeled in international finance at the most intellectually prolific time of Pentti Kouri. He would certainly have a lot to say about this.

BIS Review 84/2010 1 Lim Hng Kiang: Seeking new growth horizons Opening address by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade and Industry and Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 1st Annual World Islamic Banking Conference: Asia Summit 2010, Singapore, 14 June 2010. *      *      * H.E. Governor Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Central Bank of Bahrain, H.E. Governor Sultan Bin Nasser Al Suwaidi, Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, Distinguished guests, Ladies and gentlemen Introduction 1. Good morning and a warm welcome to our overseas guests. First of all, let me thank Governor Rasheed and Governor Sultan for joining us at this inaugural World Islamic Banking Conference: Asia Summit (WIBC Asia). Your presence here today is testimony to the strong and long-standing ties that Singapore enjoys with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and warm relationships between MAS and your respective central banks. 2. The World Islamic Banking Conference has been held successfully in Bahrain for the past sixteen years. We are honoured that WIBC Asia is now anchored in Singapore. We hope that the Summit will become an important event on the Islamic finance calendar over time and catalyse even greater engagement between the Middle East and Asia. Hence, the theme: “Seeking New Growth Horizons” is highly appropriate for this inaugural Summit. Strengthening Asia-Middle East engagement 3. Uncertainty and fear from the financial crisis have abated somewhat, but risks still remain. Global economic output had begun to pick up from the second quarter of 2009. The pace of recovery however varies across regions. Though global conditions have improved, recent developments in Europe have once again unsettled financial markets as doubts have arisen over the fiscal sustainability of several countries in the Euro zone. These episodic concerns serve as broad reminders that the world economy still faces serious challenges as governments, financial institutions and corporations adjust to the new realities of greater prudence, tighter market conditions and lower tolerance for weak governance and excessive leverage. 4. In Asia, economic growth has rebounded strongly above pre-crisis levels and become more broad-based. Fundamentals in Asia continue to be strong, boosted by robust domestic demand, healthy balance sheets and strong resurgence in intra-regional trade. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Asia is expected to grow by an average of 7.1% in 2010 and 2011, up from 3.4% in 2009. Having reformed and restructured their economies following the Asian Crisis a decade ago, Asia was better positioned with less fiscal imbalances or corporate excesses to emerge faster from the downturn. Prospects for sustained growth in ASEAN are also good. Its outlook is enhanced by continuing efforts to create an integrated single market by 2015. With improved trade links with the two Asian giants – China and India, ASEAN will become an even more dynamic and vibrant region within Asia. 5. The GCC countries too enjoy solid growth prospects, and look set to achieve around 5% GDP growth in 2010 and 2011, according to the IMF. They have implemented broad-based development strategies to diversify their economies away from hydrocarbons and harness new growth drivers. While the energy-related sector will remain an important 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 pillar in Asia-Middle East relations, we should develop other complementarities between the two regions such as in financial and business services, infocomm technology and media, infrastructure development, tourism as well as green technology and life sciences. 6. In this respect, the linkages between Singapore and the GCC have deepened. We have signed the milestone GCC-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Singapore companies, such as Capital and in Bahrain and UAE, Changi Airport International in Saudi Arabia, Keppel Corp in Qatar and SembCorp in UAE and Oman, have secured about S$26 billion of projects in the GCC. In addition, a strong cluster of Middle Eastern banks, such as Arab Bank, Emirates NBD, First Gulf Bank, National Bank of Kuwait and Qatar National Bank, is already based in Singapore. Quite a few are looking to expand their operations in trade finance and wealth management to capitalize on new growth opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. 7. By strengthening linkages at all levels, the Middle East and Asia can then complement each other’s development and seek out new growth areas for mutual benefit. Inter-regional platforms have been established to achieve this; for example, the Asia-Middle East Dialogue (AMED) and the ASEAN-GCC Ministerial Meeting, which was held in Singapore recently. Growth in trade between ASEAN and GCC have resumed post-crisis and is expected to receive a further boost with the ASEAN-GCC trade and investment framework agreement and FTA. I therefore urge all parties to work swiftly towards a mutually-beneficial conclusion. Reforming finance to sustain growth 8. The financial sector has encountered major turbulence and headwinds as a result of the financial crisis and has de-leveraged extensively in response to a more risk-sensitive environment. Significant changes in financial regulation are underway. Global regulators under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are working to put fractured financial markets back on a sounder footing. These changes include increasing the quality and quantity of risk-based capital, introducing new global liquidity requirements, and developing a fresh regulatory approach towards systemically important financial institutions. Such reforms should bring about greater stability to the global financial system. 9. These changes will not be dramatic for Singapore-based financial institutions because MAS’ regulation and supervision have been sound, prudent and effective. This has helped our financial system to remain resilient through the crisis. Last week, MAS communicated our long-standing approach in the latest monograph – “Tenets of Effective Regulation” where we reiterated that our approach to regulatory development is outcome-focused, risk appropriate and impact sensitive. MAS’ policies and actions need to be clear and consistent as well as responsive to industry and market changes and economic cycles. We believe that a stable and dynamic financial system that serves the needs of the economy and the public cannot be built on regulation alone. Responsible and competent board and senior management who manage the risks of their financial institutions well are also critical. Growing interest in Islamic finance 10. The general outlook for Islamic finance remains positive despite the negative spillover from the financial crisis. As a basic tenet, Islamic finance emphasizes that financing activities should underpin real commercial activities. Due to its widening acceptance and its appeal as a means for ethical investment, the industry is expected to continue growing at twice the pace of its conventional counterpart. As such, surveys estimate that the industry will soon cross the US$1 trillion mark in total assets. 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 11. But similar to conventional banks, Islamic financial institutions have been impacted by the economic slowdown and resulting weaker asset prices. Some financial institutions have been badly affected by the over-concentration in illiquid assets and overly-optimistic business plans. The Islamic industry therefore needs to take heed of the lessons learnt from the current crisis and pay greater attention to issues related to capital adequacy, market liquidity and risk management. Overcoming these challenges will require strong cooperation within the industry and across different jurisdictions. MAS, as a full and Council member of the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) since 2005, will continue to advocate and support multi-national initiatives that would bring about such improvements. Singapore as a global city for business and finance 12. As we have seen in recent times, financial centres are important nodes in ensuring that the world economy continues to function well. They need to be responsive to the dynamic market place in order to perform their critical roles to sustain growth by ensuring that capital is channeled to the most productive uses.  13. Singapore as a vibrant and cosmopolitan Global City is well-positioned for businesses to connect to Asia and international markets. Over time, we have established the necessary infrastructure, global connectivity and pool of expertise with the requisite knowledge, understanding and experience of local conditions in Asia that can add value to companies entering the region. 14. As a financial centre offering a full suite of financial services, Singapore stands ready to play a wider developmental role in promoting Islamic finance in response to rising regional demand for Shariah-compliant products and services. MAS has worked closely with the industry and other government agencies to ensure a level-playing field between Islamic and conventional finance such that Islamic finance is not disadvantaged for tax and regulatory purposes where the economic substance and risks are similar. 15. Many market players are already leveraging on Singapore’s strengths and capabilities to raise capital, create infrastructure and real estate funds and conduct wealth and asset management activities. For instance, the Islamic Development Bank and City Development Ltd have tapped our capital markets to raise Shariah-compliant Singapore-dollar funding. Another notable development is the joint venture by Singapore’s Keppel T&T and Saudi Arabia’s Al Rajhi Group to create the world’s first Shariah-compliant data centre fund. Last week, the fund managed to secure an initial US$100 million from institutional investors in Asia and Middle East. We also understand that various market players are in the midst of preparations to launch and list Islamic Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which will further boost Singapore’s position as the largest REIT market in Asia ex-Japan. 16. In talent development, several credible players have initiated training courses and programmes to enhance the financial sector’s capabilities in Islamic finance. For example, the Singapore Management University has started an International Islamic Law & Finance Centre to promote high-quality research, training and professional education. Such efforts will further support the growth and innovation of Islamic finance in the region. Conclusion 17. I am therefore pleased to launch the inaugural WIBC Asia Summit today. Such events serve to bring industry leaders together to explore and create business partnerships to capitalize on new opportunities in the Middle East and Asia. The financial crisis has not diminished the Asian growth story; in fact Asia has emerged even more compelling with growing exports and investment spending. Singapore is well-positioned to be the launch pad 
4 BIS Review 84/2010 for GCC businesses entering and investing in Asia. The Middle East also offers plenty of opportunities for Asian businesses to participate in its growth. 18. With greater awareness and adoption in more financial centres, Islamic finance is poised to play a bigger and more central role in global finance. We look forward to WIBC Asia as a key platform that will buttress the development of Islamic finance as it takes root in the region. The industry, which is open to all participants, can only reach greater heights with your commitment and support. I therefore wish you a productive conference as you seek exciting new horizons for Islamic finance. 
Ben S Bernanke: Remarks on The Squam Lake Report – fixing the financial system Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Squam Lake Conference, New York, 16 June 2010. *      *      * The Squam Lake Report – the centerpiece of this conference – is a valuable contribution to the ongoing analysis of the causes of the financial crisis and the appropriate policy responses.1 I commend the organizers for bringing together an impressive group of scholars both to produce the report and to continue the discussion of these important policy issues at this meeting. I think we all agree on the key questions facing financial regulators: How do we strengthen the financial system and its oversight so as to minimize the risk of a replay of the recent financial crisis? And should a crisis occur, how can we limit its economic costs? The report identifies two core principles that should be among those that guide us in answering these questions. First, financial policymakers and supervisors must consider more than the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions, as important as that is; they should also consider factors, including interactions of institutions and markets, that can affect the stability of the financial system as a whole. In the jargon of economists and regulators, supervisors need a macroprudential as well as a microprudential perspective. The second core principle put forth in the report is that the stakeholders in financial firms – including shareholders, managers, creditors, and counterparties – must bear the costs of excessive risk-taking or poor business decisions, not the public. The perception that some institutions are “too big to fail” – and its implication that, for those firms, profits are privatized but losses are socialized – must be ended. The Federal Reserve strongly agrees with both of these principles, and both have been important in shaping our views on regulatory reform. We also broadly agree with the narrative of the crisis offered in the report, which discusses, among other things, the role of subprime lending in the housing boom and bust; the structural weaknesses in the shadow banking system, including insufficient transparency and investor overreliance on rating agencies; inadequate risk management by many financial institutions; and a flawed regulatory framework that allowed some large financial firms to escape strong consolidated supervision and gave no regulator the mandate or powers needed to effectively evaluate and respond to risks to the financial system as a whole. Weaknesses in both the private sector and the public sector, in the framework for regulation, and in supervisory execution all contributed to the crisis. The crisis in turn led to a severe tightening of credit, a collapse in confidence, and a sharp global economic downturn. The Squam Lake recommendations What, then, is to be done? The Squam Lake Report provides a substantial set of recommendations. Among these are the adoption of a more systemic approach to the supervision and regulation of financial firms and markets; enhanced capital and liquidity regulation for financial firms, particularly for systemically important institutions; improved                                                  1  Kenneth R.

information collection by regulators and, where possible, the public release of such information; development of a resolution regime that would allow the authorities to manage the failure of a systemically important financial firm in an orderly manner while imposing losses on shareholders and creditors; and significant strengthening of the financial infrastructure, particularly for derivatives contracts. The Federal Reserve has supported legislative changes in all of these areas, and, where possible under current law, has initiated changes along these lines within its own operations. In the remainder of my remarks I will elaborate briefly on these recommendations, with particular attention to how they are currently helping shape regulatory reform and the Fed’s own regulatory and supervisory activities. The systemic approach to supervision The report correctly notes that most financial regulatory systems throughout the world are designed primarily to ensure the soundness of individual institutions. While this is an important mission, we agree with the authors of the report that it is not sufficient. The failure of large, complex, and interconnected financial firms can disrupt the broader financial system and the overall economy, and such firms should be regulated with that fact in mind. Likewise, the costs of the failure of critical financial infrastructures, such as payments and settlements systems, are likely to be much greater and more widely felt than the costs imposed directly on the owners of and participants in those systems. Regulatory agencies must thus supervise financial institutions and critical infrastructures with an eye toward overall financial stability as well as the safety and soundness of each individual institution and system. Indeed, the crisis has demonstrated that a too-narrow focus on the safety and soundness of individual institutions or systems can result in a failure to detect and thwart emerging threats to financial stability that cut across many firms or markets. A critical building block of a successful systemic, or macroprudential, approach to supervision is a requirement that all systemically important financial firms be subject to consolidated supervision. That is, one regulator must be responsible and able to review the full range of activities of such firms. Before the recent financial crisis, many major financial firms – including investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and large insurance companies like American International Group – were able to avoid robust comprehensive supervision. In the future, all firms that present systemic risks – regardless of whether they happen to own an insured depository institution – must be subject to a common, comprehensive framework of supervision and regulation. The financial reform bills that were passed in both the House and the Senate would expand and strengthen consolidated supervision of firms whose failure would pose risks to the financial system. The report recommends that a single systemic regulator be assigned responsibility for overseeing the health of the overall financial system and, in particular, that this duty be assigned to the central bank. We agree that the central bank – in the United States, the Federal Reserve – should be extensively involved in the collective effort to promote financial stability. The reasons for this involvement include the central bank’s breadth of expertise and its traditional roles in promoting financial stability and serving as a backstop liquidity provider to the financial system. However, giving all macroprudential responsibilities to a single agency risks creating regulatory blind spots, as – in the United States, at least – the skills and experience needed to oversee the many parts of our complex financial system are distributed across a number of regulatory agencies. Rather than concentrating all macroprudential authorities in a single agency, we prefer that all regulators be required to routinely factor macroprudential considerations into their supervision, thus helping ensure that risks to financial stability can be addressed wherever they arise. For similar reasons, we have supported the creation of a Systemic Risk Council made up of the financial supervisors. Such a council would provide a forum for agencies with differing responsibilities and perspectives to share information and approaches, and would facilitate 2 BIS Review 83/2010 
identification and mitigation of emerging threats to financial stability. At the same time, consistent with the report’s recommendation that the lines of accountability for systemic oversight be clearly drawn, we believe the council should not be directly involved in rule-writing and supervision. Rather, those functions should remain with the relevant supervisors, with the council in a coordinating role. Even as the legislative process moves forward, at the Federal Reserve we have already taken a number of steps to reorient and strengthen our supervision of the largest, most complex financial firms that we oversee and to broaden our field of vision to incorporate macroprudential concerns. For example, in my view a critical feature of a successful systemic approach to supervision is a multidisciplinary perspective. Our experience a year ago with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or the SCAP (popularly known as the bank stress tests), demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of employing such a perspective. We are working to ensure that our supervision of large banking organizations and financial market utilities makes use of the wide range of skills of Federal Reserve staff, including those of economists, financial market specialists, payments systems experts, accountants, and others, as well as bank supervisors. The SCAP also showed how much can be learned by simultaneous evaluations and comparisons of the practices and portfolios of different firms, rather than focusing on only one firm at a time, as was the supervisory approach often taken in the past. Thus, we are increasing our use of cross-firm, horizontal examinations. And we are implementing a quantitative surveillance mechanism and enhanced data collection to further strengthen our supervision of systemic firms. Enhanced capital and liquidity regulation As the report notes, minimizing the risk of future financial crises will require tougher prudential standards for financial firms, especially systemically important financial firms, as well as more intensive supervision. Stronger capital and liquidity standards and more-stringent risk-management requirements for larger and more interconnected firms are necessary to reduce the probability that a systemic firm will experience financial distress and so harm the financial system and the economy. Enhanced prudential standards for the largest firms should also reduce the incentive of firms to grow or otherwise expand their systemic footprint in order to become perceived as too big to fail. At the Federal Reserve, we are already working both domestically and internationally to increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital that banks are required to hold, to better link capital standards to the risks that banks face, and to reduce the pro-cyclicality of the regulatory capital and accounting frameworks. All of these changes will enable firms to better withstand adverse systemwide shocks. To be sure, reasonable transition periods will be necessary to allow banks to meet these more demanding standards without unduly constricting credit or endangering the recovery. In addition to enhanced capital standards, we are also working with domestic and international colleagues on toughening liquidity requirements. A prominent feature of the crisis was the inadequate liquidity risk-management practices of some major financial firms. Some firms, notably the independent investment banks, relied excessively on volatile, wholesale, short-term funding sources and were overly exposed when those funding markets were disrupted. To better prevent excessive levels of liquidity risk, major financial firms should be subject to explicit, internationally consistent liquidity standards. Systemically important firms also should be subject to stronger risk-management standards, supported by high-quality management information systems. In addition, supervisors should require major financial firms to structure their incentive compensation programs to promote long-term financial performance and avoid excessive risk-taking. BIS Review 83/2010 3 
An improved information infrastructure Both regulation and market discipline have important roles to play in constraining risk-taking in financial markets; the best outcomes are achieved when these two forms of oversight work effectively together. The report recommends a better system of data collection and aggregation to enhance this partnership. Better data collection would enable regulators to more accurately assess and compare risks across firms, markets, and products. A regulatory requirement to track and report timely, consistent, and fully aggregated data on risk exposures could also promote better risk management by the firms themselves. And increased public disclosure of such data would provide investors and analysts with a more complete picture of individual firms’ strengths and vulnerabilities, as well as of potential risks to the system as a whole, thereby facilitating more effective market discipline. Consistent with this recommendation, and in preparation for possible changes in the regulatory framework, the Federal Reserve is expanding its already-extensive commitment to the collection and analysis of financial data. For example, efforts are under way to construct better measures of counterparty credit risk and interconnectedness among systemically critical firms. In particular, to better identify potential channels of financial contagion, supervisors are working to improve their understanding of banks’ largest exposures to other banks, nonbank financial institutions, and corporate borrowers. We are also collecting data on banks’ trading and securitization exposures, as well as their liquidity risks, as part of an internationally coordinated effort to improve regulatory standards in these areas. Importantly, attention is being paid not only to the risks to individual firms, but also to potential systemic risks arising from firms’ common exposures or sensitivity to common shocks. Resolution regime A clear lesson from the events of the past few years – and a recommendation in the report with which we strongly agree – is that the government must not be forced to choose between the unattractive alternatives of bailing out a systemically important firm or having it fail in a disorderly and disruptive manner. The government instead must have the tools to resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline – by ensuring that shareholders and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are replaced – while at the same time cushioning the broader financial system from the possibly destabilizing effects of the firm’s collapse. Having a method to resolve failing firms safely is necessary if commitments to allow failure are to be credible, which in turn is essential to reverse the perception that some firms are too big to fail. The financial reform legislation in both the House and the Senate would provide for such a resolution regime. In both versions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would be given the authority to manage the resolution of systemically important nonbank financial institutions in a manner broadly similar to the authority it uses for banks under current law. As noted in the report, a key challenge would be fostering the international cooperation needed to manage the cross-border aspects of such a resolution regime. To help ensure the efficacy of this resolution authority, the financial reform legislation under consideration in the Congress usefully requires each systemically important financial firm to prepare a “living will” that sets out a plan for winding down the firm’s operations in an orderly manner – another recommendation in the report. The creation and supervisory review of these plans would require firms and their regulators to confront the difficulties posed by complex legal structures well in advance of the firm’s financial distress, and in some cases could lead firms to simplify their internal structures. While these contingency plans might not actually serve as templates for the resolution of firms that reach the brink of failure, the preparation and periodic review of the plans could be a valuable supervisory tool in preparing firms to withstand distress. 4 BIS Review 83/2010 
BIS Review 83/2010 5 Financial infrastructure The report also addresses the importance of a strong financial market infrastructure that includes well-functioning and appropriately regulated central counterparties. Strong infrastructure helps reduce systemic risk and guards against contagion in times of stress; by contrast, weak infrastructure can increase risk and spawn contagion. The Federal Reserve has long supported efforts to improve the infrastructure for the clearing and settlement of derivatives. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was a leader in improving the documentation, settlement, and transparency of credit default swaps. The Federal Reserve has also encouraged the development of industry warehouse utilities for the collection of trade information on derivatives. Although individually customized derivatives still have an important place in the financial marketplace, we believe that systemic risk can be reduced in derivative markets by increasing the standardization of contracts and by requiring standardized derivatives to be cleared through well-regulated central counterparties. In addition, it is also critical that relevant financial regulators have access to detailed information on the derivatives markets – including both standardized and customized transactions – so that they can assess the extent to which derivatives trades might concentrate risk or transmit localized or regional shocks throughout the financial system. The market for repurchase agreements, or repos, also played a prominent role in transmitting risk during the crisis. The Federal Reserve is working to improve the infrastructure arrangements in the triparty repo market and is exploring what other steps should be taken to improve the stability of this key funding market. Given the important role played by financial market infrastructures, we support the current legislative provisions that would help ensure that payment, clearing, and settlement systems – including central counterparties – are subject to robust and consistent risk-management standards and do not pose dangers to the financial system as a whole. Status of legislation The Congress has made significant progress in each of the substantive areas I have discussed today as well as many others. Indeed, it appears that final legislation that addresses in some way the great majority of the recommendations in The Squam Lake Report could be enacted in the next few weeks. Like you, we will be following legislative developments closely as we continue to plan for and implement reform. Once again, I appreciate the valuable contribution this group has made to articulating an intellectual framework for transforming the lessons of the recent financial crisis into practical recommendations. I look forward to discussing these issues with many of you in the future. 
BIS Review 90/2010 1 Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: Towards a safer financial system Intervention by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the US Financial Services Roundtable, Brussels, 28 June 2010. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to meet you today here in Brussels to discuss the post-crisis regulatory agenda from a transatlantic perspective.  The costs of the crisis have been tremendous on both sides of the Atlantic. Credit market related losses amount up to 731 bn. US dollar in the US and 272 bn. US dollar in the euro area. Capital had to be raised due to the crisis of 519 bn US dollar in the US and 288 billion US dollar in the euro area. Moreover governments on both sides of the Atlantic have committed support to the banking sector of up to 28% of GDP. So, there is no doubt that this crisis has come at the cost of substantially lower profits and great loss in overall income. Therefore, looking at these facts makes one thing very clear: We have to come up with a global reform of the financial system, so to prevent such deep crisis from occurring again.  Indeed, it has been one of the key lessons from the financial crisis that financial stability in our highly interconnected financial system can only be achieved through globally consistent and concerted efforts. Leadership of both public and private decision-makers in sustaining an intense international dialogue is therefore essential. Today’s visit of the US Financial Services Roundtable is a very welcome initiative by leaders of the financial services industry to this end.  The extraordinary nature and consequences of the global financial crisis have demonstrated the need to reform the financial system. Various weaknesses have been detected and under the aegis of the G20 a comprehensive set of measures have been agreed upon. It is envisaged to strengthen both macro- and micro-prudential supervision as well as to enhance the use of market infrastructure. These measures will need to be complementary and supplementary to one another in order to have the desired effect. For this an intense international dialogue is key. The global agenda for strengthening the financial system is very broad and I will not be able to cover all areas comprehensively today. I will therefore limit my speech to those areas of reform which are of particular importance. I will highlight some important areas as regards the regulatory reform, will touch briefly upon the supervisory reform and will then elaborate on the reform priorities in the area of market infrastructures.  Regulatory reform The crisis has shown the importance of containing the excessive build-up of leverage in good times and enhancing the overall quality of capital with a view to strengthening the resilience of the financial sector. The package prepared by the Basel Committee covering capital and liquidity reform proposals is very comprehensive and addresses these issues by improving the quality, consistency and transparency of capital for credit institutions, as well as developing a framework for liquidity risk. [The main elements of the proposals are: First, to improve the quality of capital, especially Tier-1 capital to improve loss-absorption on a going concern basis. Second, the introduction of a non-risk-based leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk control framework aims at curbing the excessive balance sheet growth we have witnessed. Third, the introduction of a range of measures, intended to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclicality of the financial system. And lastly, the introduction of capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning should ensure that the 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 financial system absorbs the shocks and thus evening the volatility of the financial and real economic cycles.]  As you know, quantitative impact assessments have been conducted in order to assess the cumulative impact of the reform on financial institutions and on the real economy. As the preliminary results will be discussed at the July meeting of the Basel Committee, it would be premature to take a position on matters such as the desirable calibration. But let me just make two points. Firstly, from a conceptual point of view the ECB supports the proposed measures, particularly in light of the lessons learned from the crisis. Secondly, the ECB is of the view that notwithstanding the outcome of the impact assessments, we should not weaken the standards. It would be preferable that where relevant a longer transition period is agreed upon, balancing the need for enhancing banking stability and maintaining the stable provision of credit to the economy. The crisis has also highlighted the particular importance of so-called systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Therefore another important part of the regulatory reform is the need to reduce the moral hazard associated with systemically important financial institutions. It will be key to find ways how SIFIs can internalise the potential costs they pose to the financial system. This could be achieved by the introduction of additional prudential measures, for instance through capital surcharges or contingent capital instruments, liquidity surcharges, more intrusive supervision, and/or the introduction of bank levies.  Although work is still underway and the Financial Stability Board is expected to provide recommendations to the G20 summit of November in Seoul, the European Council has recently agreed that EU Member States should introduce systems of levies and taxes on financial institutions to ensure fair burden-sharing and to set incentives to contain systemic risk.  As regards these initiatives, I would like to underline that the ECB has always been supportive of exploring the feasibility of such measures. However, for such measures to have the desired effect, it is important that an internationally coordinated solution is ensured. I am also of the view that any contribution by financial institutions should be complementary and coherent with supervisory and regulatory regimes. Sequencing of the implementation of measures is thus of utmost importance. Finally, it is important that the higher overall cost of funding is not passed on to the customers, for instance in the form of higher lending rates/fees or lower remuneration on deposits.  Another important area of regulatory reform is the efforts underway to achieve a single set of high-quality global and independent accounting standards by June 2011. In order to have a sound regulatory framework having high-quality and convergent accounting standards is crucial. We have to ensure that the current gap between the IFRS and US GAAP narrow rather than widen. It seems that the current FASB proposals on classification and measurement of financial instruments would result in more financial instruments to be measured at fair value, leading to an overall expansion of fair value accounting. Accepting this would not address some of the key lessons from the financial crisis, namely that fair value accounting does not always provide decision-useful information and it may exacerbate pro-cyclical effects. In addition, an expansion of fair value accounting would be in direct contradiction to the “mixed measurement model” as endorsed by the IASB, and therefore represent a major setback on achieving accounting convergence.  Supervisory reform Let me turn to briefly touch on the progress with the supervisory reform. If there is one uncontested lesson from the crisis it is the need to further develop the capacity of the authorities to conduct macroprudential supervision. The ultimate aim of macro-prudential policies is to contain the build up of financial vulnerabilities and ensure that the financial 
BIS Review 90/2010 3 system is able to withstand their unwinding, minimising potential spill-overs to the real economy. An effective macro-prudential framework aims at delivering a thorough analysis of systemic risks, as well as the formulation of appropriate policies to address such risks identifying, in a timely fashion, the emergence and build up of critical vulnerabilities, and deciding on effective (pre-emptive) intervention.  In Europe a new body will be set up: the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). It will be responsible for the macro-prudential supervision of the EU financial system. The key task of the ESRB will be to identify and assess risks to the stability of the EU financial system and issue risk warnings when the identified risks appear to be significant and policy recommendations for remedial action. I am happy that with its involvement in the ESRB, the ECB will continue to play an active role in safeguarding the financial stability in Europe.  Financial Market infrastructures Let me now turn to the priorities as regards financial market infrastructures. Financial market infrastructures underpin the stability of the financial system. By applying highly sophisticated standardised risk management procedures and enabling multilateral netting and risk-sharing, infrastructures provide both very resilient and efficient risk management services to their users. Market infrastructures can also act as centralised sources of information for authorities and the public, thereby enhancing market transparency and facilitating the early detection of financial imbalances. Furthermore, by interposing themselves between trading counterparties, infrastructures can reduce the interconnectedness between major financial institutions and the associated contagion risks. Therefore, it might not be a surprise that market infrastructures have been soundly withstanding the storm of the financial crisis. Still, I would like to draw your attention to three main policy priorities regarding financial infrastructures in light of the lessons from the financial crisis. The first priority relates to the development of financial infrastructures in those markets where they are not yet sufficiently used or available, notably in OTC derivatives markets. The crisis has shown that markets with adequate infrastructures and hence proper risk management and risk provisions have proven to be more resilient than markets without such infrastructures, such as the OTC derivatives markets. Therefore, expanding the use of central counterparties (CCPs) in these increasingly systemically relevant markets is a key measure to reduce counterparty and operational risk. Another important step is the mandatory reporting of all trades to centralised trade registries, so-called trade repositories, in order to enhance market transparency. In my view, if CCPs and trade repositories for credit default swaps had been available before the Lehman default, Lehman’s CDS exposures could have been managed in a much more transparent and resilient way and could have mitigated the negative chain reaction on CDS markets that followed the demise of Lehman.  CCPs and trade repositories for OTC derivatives are ultimately beneficial for all stakeholders. Still, there are the well-known challenges of effective collective action in the context of the provision of public goods. Hence, private sector efforts alone may not suffice to foster sufficient progress towards the use of CCPs and trade repositories for OTC derivatives. It is therefore important to adopt and implement the regulatory requirements for the mandatory central clearing of all eligible products and the reporting of trades to trade repositories in a timely manner. Given, however, the global nature of OTC derivatives markets, it is clear that such regulatory tools will only be successful if they are applied in a coordinated manner around the globe. I strongly support the recently launched work of the Financial Stability Board to develop common approaches to fostering the central clearing of eligible OTC derivatives as well as to expand the range of potentially clearable products through enhanced standardisation. 
4 BIS Review 90/2010 The second priority relates to the need for updated and globally consistent requirements to ensure the safety and soundness of financial infrastructures. By nature of their business, financial infrastructures concentrate systemic risk, owing to their large size, their limited degree of substitutability and the strong web of mutual interdependencies across infrastructures, e.g. arising from exposures to the same large participants. Increased reliance on market infrastructures across financial markets further underlines the importance of effectively addressing this risk. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that CCPs are able to manage these specific risks related to the clearing of OTC derivatives. Furthermore, trade repositories need to be designed, operated and overseen in an adequate manner, given the novelty of these infrastructures and the reliance of other market infrastructures, public authorities and market participants on the accuracy and availability of the respective data.  Two complementary strands of work are underway in these fields. First, legislation for OTC derivatives CCPs and trade repositories is being developed in several countries. And second, the international standards for financial market infrastructures are currently being reviewed by the CPSS and IOSCO. In this respect I believe that given the importance of a globally consistent framework for market infrastructures, it is critical to ensure that all relevant national and regional legislation is drafted in a sufficiently flexible way to allow for the effective accommodation of the work of standard-setters. The final priority I would like to stress does not relate to measures directly targeting market infrastructures themselves, but is closely related to this work: the need for improving bilateral post-trading processes in line with the requirements for market infrastructures. It is clear that without adequate bilateral risk management and disclosure, a comprehensive mitigation of systemic risk arising in post-trading could not be achieved. Moreover, an uneven regulatory level playing field could create scope for regulatory arbitrage and provide disincentives for the use of market infrastructure.  As a concrete example for necessary regulatory attention, let me mention the risk management standards for the bilateral clearing of OTC derivatives. While – as mentioned before – in principle OTC derivatives should be centrally cleared to the extent possible, some products are not suitable for central clearing, for instance owing to insufficient product standardisation, lack of market liquidity or limited availability of robust prices. At the same time, trades that are not suitable for central clearing pose particular risk management challenges given their more bespoke and opaque nature. Therefore, in my view, capital charges and collateralisation requirements for bilaterally cleared trades must be at least as stringent as the requirements for CCPs to ensure a sufficiently robust buffer against adverse market developments, operational and counterparty risks. I welcome that banking supervisors around the world are developing strengthened frameworks in this regard, working in step with the revision of global prudential standards that is currently under development by the Basel Committee.  Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude. The regulatory reform, the new emphasis placed on macro-prudential supervision and the measures to strengthen financial market infrastructures, are all key elements on our path towards greater financial stability and an important complement to strengthened risk management and disclosure at the level of financial institutions.  More specifically, it is now of key importance that the proposed legislation concerning the enhancement of the EU institutional framework and in particular the establishment of the ESRB will be finally agreed, so as to allow its start – as planned – by January 2011. Given the interconnectedness of our financial institutions and financial markets it is essential that an internationally consistent framework is created, ensuring a level playing field for financial institutions. Gatherings like the one today serve as a good forum to further enhance 
BIS Review 90/2010 5 our understanding of the issues we are facing and will thus contribute to reaching efficient and workable solutions. Therefore, I very much believe that a continuous and effective transatlantic dialogue is fundamental.  Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 90/2010 1 Prof Njuguna Ndung’u: Growing real estate through finance Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the Forum on Growing Real Estate through Finance, Kenya School of Monetary Studies, Nairobi, 23 June 2010. *      *      * The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Housing, Mr. Tirop Kosgey The Counsellors of Real Estate Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen It is my great pleasure to warmly welcome you all to this important interactive forum on “Growing Real Estate through Finance”. I thank all present for accepting our invitation. In particular, I wish to thank the Counsellors of Real Estate represented here for joining us to deliberate on growth and financing of such an important sector in the Kenyan economy. Ladies and Gentlemen: In any economy, long-term finance is one of the key drivers of economic growth. Long-term finance allows for the provision of affordable and adequate housing which is a major thrust of Kenya’s Vision 2030. Indeed, in line with the objective of this forum, one of the flagship projects under the “Housing and urbanization” as stipulated in the Vision 2030 is “Mortgage Financing Initiatives”. At an estimated annual demand of about 150,000 housing unit, the supply is barely at 35,000 leaving a gap of 115,000. The sector thus portends enormous opportunity and a major market; appropriate and innovative financing mechanisms are therefore absolutely essential. This forum brings together bankers, regulators, practitioners, researchers, academics and senior government policy makers to discuss this vital agenda – Real Estate Financing in Kenya, but I do believe that one of the solutions is not only the source of long-term finance but also the collateral technology and its process must be improved and simplified. The outcomes and policy conclusions of this interactive forum are, therefore, an important input into policy responses in addressing the binding constraints in this sector and the economy. The Kenyan financial system through its intermediation role remains the key pillar in providing mortgage financing. Although there is evidently enormous opportunity in the sector, lending to the building and construction and real estate sector stands at 12.2% (Ksh 92.5 billion as at end of 2009) of the total credit by banks and mortgage finance companies. The bulk of financing, it does appear, is through household savings. This is a clear indication that financing is one of the major constraints. While most deposits are of short term nature, mortgage finance is long-term. The traditional mismatch constraint therefore comes into play. This requires a well developed mortgage market to address long-term funding requirements of the sector. Developing mechanisms for long-term finance is good for monetary policy transmission as well. The MPC has been trying to address the issue of long-term finance; we do hope this forum can provide some viable and feasible options. Ladies and Gentlemen: The Government’s commitment to growth of real estate sector is in our blueprint for Vision 2030 and is also well articulated in the Finance Bill, 2010. The Finance Bill outlines a number of measures to spur growth in the property market. In particular, in order to facilitate provision of adequate housing to Kenya’s growing population, The Finance Bill, 2010 contains proposals to amend the Banking Act: (i) To allow mortgage finance companies to operate current accounts; and (ii) To allow banks to advance up to 40% of their total deposit liabilities up from 25% for purchase, improvement or alterations of land. 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 These measures will unlock the sector’s potentials by availing funding required to finance growth of real estate in Kenya. The Central Bank will continue to work with the sector to improve the operating environment. It is equally important for the players in the real estate sector to design innovative ways of securing funds to exploit opportunities available. For instance, pension funds are needed for guaranteeing members’ mortgages. This is happening in Kenya, but still at a low scale. Leveraging on such long-term instruments will lower costs and make decent and low cost housing available to potential borrowers. Also, other investment vehicles such as unit trusts have the potential of pooling funds required for specific projects. In addition, the success of the Kenya Government infrastructure bond as well as other corporate bonds that have followed, demonstrates enormous potential of the bond market. In 2009 alone the Government raised a total of Ksh 54.7 billion through bonds issues, and the infrastructure bonds were oversubscribed every time. This is a clear testimony of the market’s ability to provide cheaper source of funding for long-term projects such as mortgages. To further deepen the bond market, the Central Bank has implemented a number of measures, including introduction of benchmark bonds and re-opening of these benchmark bonds to create liquidity and facilitate trading. We can then use this infrastructure bond platform to develop housing bonds. Ladies and Gentlemen: In all this, a vibrant financial sector with adequate and dynamic human capital is a vital component. The Kenya School of Monetary Studies as the capacity building institution of the Central Bank of Kenya and the region is well placed to develop and implement a curriculum that fits 21st century Real Estate Financing. This curriculum is expected to be broad and multi-disciplinary cutting across various fields in demand for capacity building. Such a multi-faceted capacity building program will provide the requisite skill sets to unlock potentials of the real estate sector in Kenya. Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, with these remarks on the future of this market, it is my pleasure to declare this interactive forum officially open. I wish you all fruitful deliberations. Thank you. 
BIS Review 90/2010 1 Millison K Narh: Monetary policy and outlook for economic growth Speech by Mr Millison K Narh, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana, at the Databank Investor Forum, Accra, 26 April 2010. *      *      * 1. Introduction [1] Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank Databank for inviting me to this Forum which has brought together institutional investors to apprise themselves of policy initiatives and assess investment opportunities in the country. [2] I understand that Databank is celebrating twenty years of entrepreneurship this year. Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on your significant achievements and contributions towards Ghana’s financial sector over the past two decades and hope that you will expand your activities further in the coming years. [3] My address today will focus on “Monetary Policy and Outlook for Economic Growth”. I will seek to address this topic by focusing on three key issues. That is, the Bank of Ghana’s monetary policy stance, the stabilization role of monetary policy in the Ghanaian economy and lastly, the outlook for economic growth in 2010 and beyond. 2. The monetary policy stance of the Bank of Ghana [4] The primary objective of the Bank of Ghana is to maintain price stability. The objective of price stability is not an end in itself; rather it is in the interest of promoting balanced and sustainable growth in the long-term. Indeed, the clear focus on price stability as stipulated in the Bank of Ghana Act 612 reflects a consensus from various policy dialogues that “inflation is a major obstacle to the growth process and price stability can contribute to accelerating growth by promoting an enabling environment for efficient investment and savings decision-making”. Various country experiences, including Ghana, show that sustained periods of strong growth have always gone hand in hand with low inflation whereas low growth episodes occur under highly inflationary environments. [5] As you may be aware, the Ghanaian economy witnessed consistent growth periods in the recent past with real GDP growth increasing steadily from 3.7 percent to 7.3 percent within a spate of nine years. To a large extent this growth phase of the Ghanaian economy was largely supported by a policy environment aimed at macroeconomic stability which anchored inflation expectations. This was combined with structural reforms, particularly in the financial sector, needed to increase financial intermediation and promote economic growth. [6] Although growth was achieved, the reemergence of macro instability underpinned by both external and domestic factors such as considerable credit expansion to both government and the private sector dislodged inflationary expectations and increased inflationary pressures in the economy. The combined effect of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies resulted in severe macroeconomic imbalances characterized by rising inflation, exchange rate depreciation and loss of international reserves. To bring back stability in the economy, the policy framework had to refocus on restrictive monetary policy and fiscal prudence, leading to tight credit conditions, a general slowdown in the economy, and low economic growth in 2009. [7] It is therefore prudent that in seeking to promote economic growth, the Bank of Ghana remains committed to its mission of price stability as well as improving the regulatory and supervisory frameworks to secure a strong financial sector for efficient intermediation. In delivering this mandate, the Bank of Ghana’s operational framework for monetary policy involves adjusting interest rates to achieve the target inflation in the policy horizon. By this 
2 BIS Review 90/2010 process, the stance of monetary policy is to continuously assess risks to growth and inflation and properly position the key policy rate to restore balance between inflation and growth. [8] The mandate and strategy of the Bank of Ghana is consistent with theoretical arguments in the economic literature regarding the role of monetary policy in attaining price stability. We also believe that monetary policy should be mindful of the country’s growth objectives. Therefore, by committing to the long-term objective of price stability, the Bank’s monetary policy strategy adopts a gradualist policy response approach to addressing shocks in the economy so as to minimize the output loss associated with pursuing our inflation objective and help anchor inflation expectations. 3. The stabilizing role of monetary policy [9] It is useful for us to understand how monetary policy has over the past year and half contributed to stabilize the Ghanaian economy, and how it is currently being fashioned to foster growth in the economy. [10] The Ghanaian economy was severely challenged in the first half of 2009 with rising inflation, a depreciating currency, loss of international reserves and weakening business and consumer confidence. The rate of inflation increased steadily and peaked at 20.7 percent in June, the highest on record in over four years. There were excessive upward surges in the exchange rate with the local currency depreciating by 17.5 percent against the US dollar between January and June. Gross international reserve position fell to about 1.9 months of imports cover by June 2009. Clearly, these signaled an economy in stress, underlying the urgency to implement prudent policies to restore economic stability. [11] The immediate policy response was to institute a stringent policy framework of restrictive monetary policy complemented by prudent fiscal policies to restore stability. These measures were also supported by multilateral and bilateral assistance. Monetary policy tightening was deemed necessary in support of stringent fiscal policies aimed at steering the economy back to stability. Hence, the Bank of Ghana responded to the economic challenges by adjusting the policy rate upwards by 150 basis points. [12] Let me state that the macroeconomic outcome of the stringent policy framework has been positive. The policies have contributed immensely to the return of stability and are gradually restoring business and consumer confidence in the economy. With tighter monetary policies, stability in the local currency has been restored and the disinflation process is ongoing. Year on year inflation has declined steadily from its peak in July 2009 to 13.3 percent in March 2010. Similarly, the core measure of inflation (excluding energy and utility) is declining indicating downward inflationary pressures within the economy. [13] The latest assessment of the economy by the Bank of Ghana point to improved economic fundamentals driven by diminishing inflationary pressures, exchange rate stability, a gradual pick-up in economic activity and improvements in investor and consumer confidence. The external position has strengthened with significant increases in the reserve level, as well as improvements in the trade and current account balance in spite of the challenges of the spillover from the world economic downturn. Overall, the economy has responded well to the tight policy responses. [14] These notwithstanding, economic activities in 2009 remained subdued in line with the policy tightening stance although some indicators of economic activities and confidence indices show signs of recovery. Real GDP slowed from 7.3 percent in 2008, reflecting expansionary policies and strong credit expansion to a provisional forecast of 4.7 percent in 2009 as credit conditions tightened. [15] With cognizance to the successful role played by monetary policy in shifting the economy back to the disinflation path and price stability, the Bank of Ghana also realizes the need to complement the process by stimulating economic growth in the medium-term. 
BIS Review 90/2010 3 Consequently, the policy rate has been cut by a cumulative 350 basis points between November 2009 and March 2010. With the reduction, it is anticipated that credit conditions will gradually ease and credit growth will be restored to ensure a steady growth in output. 4. Outlook for economic growth [16] The outlook for economic growth remains positive. Although growth was constrained in 2009 on the basis of tighter policies, improved economic conditions have paved the way for monetary policy easing to stimulate growth in 2010 and beyond. There are indications of a rebound in business and consumer confidence, as well as increasing investor confidence in the economy. Hence, as economic stability gains a firm hold, the private sector must reposition itself to drive the growth agenda. [17] As noted in the 2010 budget and economic policy statement, the government will continue with the fiscal consolidation process which started in 2009 with a view to stabilizing inflation and reducing exchange rate volatilities. External sector policies will also focus on building up reserves (which is currently at 3 months imports cover), and reducing the current account deficit, while pursuing strategies to increase economic growth in 2010. The budget is optimistic about growth prospects in 2010 with a revised real GDP growth of 6.5 percent compared to an initial program target of 5.0 percent. [18] Starting from 2011, Ghana will benefit from oil production which is expected to attract additional investments into the country, and boost economic growth. Initial production is projected to contribute about 17 percent towards Ghana’s GDP. Accordingly, real GDP growth has been estimated to increase above 20 percent in 2011. [19] There is a general consensus that the contribution of monetary policy is to stabilize the economy and create an enabling environment for sustainable growth in the long-run. Looking forward therefore, the Bank of Ghana’s monetary policy stance will remain focused on steering the economy towards price stability whilst deepening financial intermediation processes to ensure that credit flows to the productive sectors of the economy. [20] Despite the role of monetary policy in creating an enabling environment, promoting long-term growth is a complex process and requires the support of structural reforms that seek to remove “binding constraints” on the business environment to ensure sustainable growth. Clearly, monetary policy is limited beyond the scope of resolving structural bottlenecks that often constrain growth in the Ghanaian economy. The commitment of the Bank of Ghana to ensure macroeconomic stability and ease credit constraints must therefore be supported by policy reforms to strengthen the investment climate, increase productivity and innovation, as well as close infrastructural gaps especially in the energy and road sectors. [21] It is anticipated that the increased government revenues from the oil production will create the much needed fiscal space to close the country’s infrastructural gaps and ease some of these growth constraints. Additionally, the implementation of credible fiscal consolidation policies underscored by growth-enhancing measures should provide the needed boost for the private sector and accelerate economic growth. 5. Conclusion [22] Ghana’s economy has rebounded strongly from the instability that characterized the first half of 2009. Recent trends indicate that macroeconomic stability has gained ground with declining inflation, exchange rate stability, growing reserves as well as increasing investor and business confidence. These conditions have paved the way for monetary policy easing to increase investments and spur economic growth. 
4 BIS Review 90/2010 [23] Most importantly, the Central Bank remains committed to delivering a low inflation environment that would support the overall broad development agenda of growth and poverty reduction. Consistent with this, the monetary policy regime will sustain price stability and economic growth. [24] I would like to conclude by stressing that monetary policy can effectively maintain price stability but it must be accompanied by structural reforms that will create the enabling environment for accelerated growth in the long-run. Therefore, notwithstanding Bank of Ghana’s monetary policy stance to preserve price stability and create an enabling environment to foster growth, structural reforms to ease binding constraints in the economy must be implemented to make Ghana competitive and an important investment destination within the sub-region.  
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Sada S Reddy: Fijian business – on the edge Presentation by Mr Sada S Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, to the Fiji Indigenous Business Council, Suva, Fiji, 23 June 2010. *      *      * The Chairman of the Fiji Indigenous Business Council, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen Good Morning I am very honoured to be invited to speak to you this morning. I have been requested to speak on the theme: “Fijian Business: On the Edge.” Well, when I looked at the topic, a number of things came to my mind. First of all, what does a Fijian Business mean for instance; and secondly why “on the edge”. Let me first deal with what a “Fijian Business” means to me. I presume it means any business venture that the indigenous people of Fiji own and operate as distinct from business ventures owned and operated by the rest of the people of Fiji, including foreign investors. If my understanding is correct then I need to ask why is that you wish to distinguish Fijian Businesses from the rest of Fiji Businesses. I guess this is where the challenge comes.  For your council to form an association to represent the indigenous businesses itself shows that you have seen the need for such a body to address some of the opportunities and challenges you collectively feel need to be addressed. So what are these challenges and needs? I have to confess I have not had the opportunity until today to discuss with anyone of you to really find out what exactly are the aims and objectives of the Fiji Indigenous Business Council. But I have closely followed, through various media, the activities of various business associations including your association, over the years and therefore have some idea about what these associations’ aims and objectives are. I guess one of the key issues your members have to deal with is how to grow and compete with existing businesses. This in itself is a very difficult and complex issue. When you look at some of the successful Fiji businesses, you will find that they have all had very humble and small beginnings. Some started off with corner grocery shop and over say two to three generations of hard work, personal and family sacrifices, enormous discipline in managing money, building up saving and making prudent business decisions, managing business risks, developing strategic business alliances, but more importantly having a passionate vision and working day and night to achieve that vision.  There is no short cut. Most of the successful businesses you see today did not get any government help in the initial years. It had to be sheer hard work, discipline, both at personal and family level. Business acumen was inculcated from parents to children from a very young age. In this modern business world, as well, there is no short cut. But in these days, you have to be well educated, and also smarter than the rest. Knowledge of the business world is critically important.  At this juncture, let me make one very important point in relation to indigenous business. I have had the opportunity to diagnose the failures of a number of indigenous businesses during my long career in the Reserve Bank of Fiji. One of the most challenging things I have noticed is the lack of financial discipline, lack of budgeting and anticipating and managing business and personal risks. 
2 BIS Review 88/2010 Ladies and gentlemen, the message I wish to leave with you today is that nobody owes anyone a living in this modern world. You have to be a survivor and learn to survive in this world of business. If you are successful, then there is no limit to your growth and well-being for you, your family, your employees and your community.  The second element of this Conference theme is “On the Edge”. Are indigenous businesses “on the edge”? I do not know how to respond to this question. However, what I can do is to analyse for your benefit the business environment that you will be faced with as we move forward. The business sector will then have to work out how they manage and remain and grow their business given the business environment you will be faced with.  Let me now turn to the business environment that we are all faced with. Ladies and gentlemen, in fact, with what happened in the global economy as a result of the latest global financial crisis, many businesses have failed the world over. Direct and indirect effects of the crisis have also passed through to the Fijian economy. As a result, a number of local businesses were affected. While there may be several indigenous businesses in the list of affected companies, I am sure that they were not the only ones. Indeed, a number of companies both large and small were seriously affected because of the Global Financial Crisis. Since I have touched on the global financial crisis, let me begin by giving you an overview of the global economic conditions. In line with today’s theme, I’m sure all of us will remember that not long ago the global economy was “on the edge”. However, after much concerted efforts and policy support, the global economy has managed to turn this situation around. The world economy is improving and according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to grow by 4.2 percent this year, following a contraction of 0.6% in 2009. Last year’s performance of the global economy is actually regarded as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. On a positive note though, a further growth of 4.3 percent is expected in 2011. Ladies and gentlemen, except for Australia, all our trading partner economies contracted last year as a result of the global financial crisis. This significantly affected our exports and tourism last year. However, the worst is over now and all of these countries are expected to post a modest growth this year and continue this into 2011. This is good news for Fiji, as this means increased demand for our exports and tourism. In fact, we are already seeing the effects of these, especially in the tourism industry, where we see a strong recovery in visitor arrivals. Amongst advanced countries, the US economy is doing better than Europe and Japan, while for emerging and developing economies, Asia is driving the recovery. In particular, China and India recorded high growth rates in 2009 and are expected to record similar growth in 2010.  As is the case in most developed and developing economies worldwide, it is the business/private sector that will drive these growth prospects. Having said that, indigenous businesses play an important and crucial role in the development of their economies. All businesses, whether big or small, have a role to play in the development of the economy.  Before I return to this subject in more detail, let me share with you our expectations on the domestic economic outlook.  Economic conditions Ladies and gentlemen, let me now touch on Fiji’s current economic conditions and prospects. Our economy has been contracting over the last 3 years. Last year our economy contracted by 2.2 percent. However, the economy is expected to regain some strength in 2010 and continue this performance into the next two years. For this year, we are expecting most sectors to show positive growth except for agriculture & forestry and health & social work sectors, which are projected to decline. The agriculture sector was badly hit by Cyclone 
BIS Review 88/2010 3 Tomas, resulting in a downward revision of the overall growth rate for this year, which now stands at 1.8 percent. Looking ahead into the next two years, growth is also expected to be broad-based. Apart from an expected decline in the building and construction sector, the tourism industry is expected to lead the growth assisted by some growth in agriculture. A growth rate of around 1.7 and 1.9 percent is expected for 2011 and 2012, respectively. While we are encouraged by the turnaround in the economy, we still have a number of fundamental issues in the economy which if not fixed will not allow us to fully realise our growth potential. We have said on so many occasions in the past that our external position, or Fiji’s balance of payments (BOP), remains vulnerable. The poor performance of our exports sector, coupled with our ever growing need for imports, continues to produce a widening trade and current account deficit. As long as we have a current account deficit, it will continue to put pressure on Fiji’s foreign reserves. The challenge remains in raising exports and minimising imports to help reduce these imbalances and ease pressure on foreign reserves.  Unless we bring the current account deficit to below 5 percent of GDP, our macroeconomic policies will need to remain relatively tight. In light of this, Government will have to consolidate its fiscal position by aiming for a reduced fiscal budget. This is expected to be supported by relatively tight monetary conditions. Now what does this mean for Fijian businesses? In the short-term, business conditions in Fiji may not be easy. A tight fiscal policy can mean fewer tax breaks and handouts to businesses. Tight monetary policies can mean that loans will be more expensive. Therefore, businesses should brace themselves to survive against challenges during these times.  So, how do you manage in such an environment? I do not think I can give you any serious advice in this regard. But, I suppose I can make some general comments here.  Businesses should consider adjustments in their operations. You need to work smarter so that the limited resources you have gives you the maximum returns. You can consider product diversification – look for new and perhaps, niche, business opportunities. Consider moving up the value chain by adding value to your current products. If you are currently providing tours for tourists, explore going into budget accommodation. If you are producing timber, consider converting them into furniture or other finished products. If the local market is saturated, consider exporting your goods and services. In addition to these, businesses should also consider staff capacity building at the various training institutions we have, TPAF for instance, to improve productivity and dynamism of your workforce.  Most importantly, as I mentioned before, an important rule is that businesses operate according to certain principles – and those principles must be followed by all business people. There are no shortcuts to success or separate rules for different ethnic groups.  Given that Government will have to tighten its own belt would mean that there will be little of any support that the Government can give to businesses in the short to medium term.  Ladies and gentlemen, our economy is expected to recover slowly in the medium term. The structural reforms planned by the Government are expected to provide a more positive business environment in the future. Reduced government expenditure is expected to provide space for private investment to take place and business conditions are expected to improve. Now the challenge for you is to find out how you, as a Fijian entrepreneur, can contribute to this economic development and nation building process.  By strengthening and consolidating your business base now, Fijian business will be better positioned to contribute to the growth process. I mentioned in some recent conferences and would like to reiterate here, that we live in a world of competition where many countries have 
4 BIS Review 88/2010 low cost structures and high productivity. Therefore, unless we raise our productivity and do business in a smarter way, we will not be able to compete successfully against the rest of the world. Reliance on preferential access is now a thing of the past, and we must learn to stand on our own feet. And remember, small businesses only remain small if they do not have a vision for getting bigger. I encourage you to form that vision – where do you want your business to be in 5 years and 10 years from now. And then follow the path that will take you there. Like you, I am concerned about the pressing need to open the way for the advancement of indigenous businesses. I understand that this is something that previous Governments had attempted to do, but we may then ask the question – why have these policies not delivered as expected.  What is the RBF doing to assist Fijian businesses? The rising balance of payments deficit calls for concerted and decisive efforts by all stakeholders. At the Reserve Bank, we have embarked on various initiatives that can help cushion such economic deficiencies and we remain focused on proactively intervening through appropriate monetary policy action in the face of any external shocks to the macro economy. The RBF has also played a wider and more proactive role in working closely with the Government on its various reform initiatives, particularly reforms in the export sector, import substitution and fiscal consolidation. Reforms in these sectors have been slow moving and greater action is still needed. Now let me briefly highlight some of the work that the Reserve Bank is doing in the areas of small and micro enterprise development. Most of the work in this regard ties in with your Council’s role in developing Fijian businesses.  In April 2009, we made some institutional reforms within the Reserve Bank which resulted in the establishment of a Group called the Financial Systems Development and Compliance (FSDC) Group. One of the major roles of this Group (amongst others) was to ensure the development and provision of microfinance services to the greater Fijian community. After a little more than a year of its establishment, we have witnessed a lot of exciting developments.  From 1st January 2010, we have issued a new Microfinance Policy which requires all commercial banks to establish internal microfinance divisions and units that will serve to cater for SMEs and the underserved. Most commercial banks have complied with this Policy and have begun to offer affordable products and services to their targeted customers.  On the same token, the Reserve Bank has, through the collaboration of various donor agencies and other players, set up a National Financial Inclusion Taskforce (NFIT) that will be responsible for driving and promoting microfinance and greater financial inclusion initiatives in Fiji. The establishment of the Taskforce will provide a platform for stakeholders to encourage and foster sustained and coordinated development of financial services to the poor and rural communities and more importantly expanding access to finance for small enterprises. Membership of this Taskforce includes representatives of the microfinance institutions, commercial banks, donor agencies and the RBF.  The RBF has recently introduced an Import Substitution Facility to try to assist large scale commercial agricultural businesses to obtain credit at concessional rates of interest. A total amount of $20 million is available through the scheme. New and existing local businesses engaged in commercial agriculture may access funds from the facility at a fixed rate of 6.00 percent per annum. The facility is available for a maximum loan term of 5 years and is available through the commercial banks, licensed credit institutions and the Fiji Development Bank (FDB).  
BIS Review 88/2010 5 The RBF has also offered a scholarship for Chef Training in Malaysia which should encourage the use of local foods in preparation of hotel menus. This is targeted at reducing our import bill and improving our balance of payments position, as well as encouraging local value adding. Local businesses should try to seize the opportunities that are arising out of these initiatives I have just mentioned. The Reserve Bank is also embarking on developing an effective and all-encompassing framework to guide community or village development. No doubt, there are abundant natural resources and manpower capacity in our rural areas. However, we continue to notice the lack of progress by successive authorities in developing our rural dwellers to become more economically active.  The rural area is home to about 52 percent of Fiji’s population. More importantly, most of Fiji’s key exports are rural based, providing the greatest potential for future development and prosperity, particularly in the tourism, agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. It is therefore important that a suitable development scheme or framework is put in place in our rural villages and communities.  Our policies do not discriminate between the nationalities of businesses. All of you have the same benefit from these policies as any other business in Fiji. You must seek these opportunities out. Concluding remarks In summary, ladies and gentlemen, we have seen that the global economy is recovering. This is good news for us – we can expect our exports and services, such as tourism, to pick up.  As I had just mentioned, the need for us to maintain a healthy BOP position means that we should expect relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies in the near-term.  I have also taken some time to highlight the areas that the Reserve Bank is working on to promote small and micro enterprise development, which is in line with the FIBC’s role in developing Fijian businesses. It is in your Council’s interest to ensure that indigenous businesses are aware of these initiatives and that they benefit from them. I wish to once again underscore the importance of financial discipline and a culture of hard work and personal discipline which will ensure your success in business.  In conclusion ladies and gentlemen, I thank you again for the invitation to speak to you this morning. And I wish this symposium and your businesses all the best in the future. Vinaka vakalevu. 
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Tim Lane: Risks to Canada’s financial stability in an uncertain world Remarks by Mr Tim Lane, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Winnipeg CFA Society, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 22 June 2010. *      *      * Good afternoon. It’s a pleasure to be here. The recent past has underscored the fact that, in finance and the economy, most things are interconnected on a global scale. Throughout its history, Canada has been powerfully affected by events elsewhere. Manitobans in particular are well aware of this reality. Waves of immigration, rapid changes in commodity prices, the Great Depression, two World Wars, and technological advances – all have had an enormous impact here. More recently, the global financial crisis has been a stark reminder that everyone – even citizens in countries with sound “fundamentals” – is affected by major shocks, regardless of where those shocks originate. Global realities and their impact on the domestic financial system inform much of the Bank of Canada’s most recent issue of its Financial System Review (FSR), which was published yesterday. In the FSR, the Bank identifies and evaluates risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system. Our goal in doing this is to contribute to the long-term resiliency of the Canadian financial system by promoting informed discussion of various relevant issues and developments.  In my remarks today, I’d like to discuss two issues that are discussed in the FSR, which, directly or indirectly, pose risks to financial stability. These issues are sovereign debt and global macroeconomic imbalances. Both are “global” issues, but they will have to be managed at the national, as well as the international, level. As such, they are at the core of ongoing G20 discussions, including those taking place this week in Toronto.  I’ll start by taking a very brief look at the Canadian economy – where we are now, and where we appear to be headed. Then, I’ll elaborate on the two issues I’ve identified. I’ll welcome comments and questions at the end. The Canadian economy The global economic recovery is under way, but it is an uneven one. In the emerging-market economies, growth has been vigorous – indeed it has been stronger than we expected a few months ago. At the same time, in most advanced economies, the recovery has been subdued and heavily dependent on the exceptional stimulus provided by monetary and fiscal policies. In recent months, concerns over European sovereign debt have dampened prospects for the recovery in Europe. So far, these concerns have had limited effects on Canada – mainly, a modest fall in commodity prices and some tightening of financial conditions – but they are an important risk to the recovery.  In Canada, the economic recovery is proceeding somewhat more rapidly than expected. Growth has been very strong in the past two quarters, although we expect it to moderate, starting this quarter. Several factors have been supporting the recovery: fiscal and monetary stimulus, improved financial conditions, the rebound in global economic growth, more favourable terms of trade, and increased business and household confidence. At the same time, the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar, our poor relative productivity performance, and the low absolute level of demand in the United States are acting as a drag on the recovery. The Bank projects GDP growth of 3.7 per cent in 2010, with a gradual slowing to 3.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.9 per cent in 2012. Inflation is expected to remain close to our 2 percent target through this period.  
2 BIS Review 88/2010 In view of this outlook, the Bank of Canada indicated in late April that the need for extraordinary monetary policy stimulus – which we had been providing since the beginning of the financial crisis and through the recession – was passing. On 1 June, we increased our policy interest rate from ¼ of a per cent to ½ of a per cent. Of course, that still leaves interest rates at a very stimulative level. But because of the uncertainties – particularly those emanating from Europe – we’ve been careful to emphasize that the extent and timing of any additional withdrawal of monetary stimulus would depend on how the outlook for economic activity and inflation evolves. In making those decisions, we will always stay focused on achieving the 2 per cent inflation target. In our monetary policy decisions, we are mindful of the risks to the economic outlook, both on the upside and the downside. In assessing financial stability, the downside risks are our main focus. So let me turn now to a discussion of two areas of risk that may bear on the health and stability of the financial system, both here and abroad. First, I’ll look at the issue of sovereign debt. Sovereign debt Sovereign debt – and unsustainable fiscal deficits – have been front and centre in recent global economic events. Concerns about sovereign debt have flared up in recent months in a number of European countries. But in the coming years, many advanced countries will face major challenges in achieving and maintaining sustainable fiscal positions. In Canada, we are fortunate that this task will be more manageable than elsewhere, and continued resolve is required. The current sovereign debt problems were exacerbated and brought to a head by the global financial crisis and recession. Of course, a number of countries entered the crisis with weak fiscal positions, but their situations have deteriorated substantially. In part, this reflects the direct support many governments provided to keep troubled financial institutions afloat. Although the final bill for this support is not yet known, it could be very large. Another important element is the massive fiscal stimulus that governments in all major countries delivered to mitigate the recession. And, of course, reduced tax revenues, associated with the recession, have added substantially to the problem. Both financial system support and fiscal stimulus were necessary, since the alternative would have been much worse. When private sector spending was no longer sufficient to support growth, governments had to step in to fill the gap. But the result was a shifting of the debt build-up from the private sector to the public sector.  Growing sovereign debt is a source of risk for two main reasons. First, high levels of public debt tend to constrain economic growth.1 Second, when concerns about sovereign debt become acute – even if they are limited to a few countries – they can have pervasive effects on the financial system. These effects stem from the fundamental importance of government liabilities in the financial system. Government debt instruments are typically viewed as risk-free and highly liquid assets that are held by financial institutions and individual investors, and are used as a benchmark for pricing other financial assets. What happens, then, when these assets are perceived as risky – and when they become increasingly illiquid (as we saw in early May, when European sovereign debt markets seized up)?                                                   1  See Carmen M. Rienhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, “Growth in a Time of Debt,” available at http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/rogoff/files/Growth_in_Time_Debt.pdf: “...whereas the link between growth and debt seems relatively weak at ‘normal’ debt levels, median growth rates for countries with public debt over 90 percent of GDP are roughly one percent lower than otherwise; average (mean) growth rates are several percent lower. Surprisingly, the relationship between public debt and growth is remarkably similar across emerging markets and advanced economies” (page 2). 
BIS Review 88/2010 3 First, consider the chain of exposures to the credit risk – from the holders of those government securities, to their creditors, and their creditors’ creditors, and so on. And since many of these exposures are uncharted, the uncertainty about where the exposures lie may cause a spike in perceived counterparty risk, and thereby affect short-term financing decisions. As a result, funding markets become increasingly illiquid, with widening spreads and diminishing access to financing.  Finally, there is a general retrenchment in risk-taking, which results in a decline in the prices of risky assets – including currencies and commodities. We saw all of these transmission channels in Europe in early May. If the situation had deteriorated further, the impact on Canada’s financial conditions, and on financial conditions more generally, could have been substantial. The market turmoil in Europe was met by a forceful policy response. In the affected countries – as happens with most sovereign debt crises – there are two dimensions to the problem: the short-term challenge of rolling over debt, and the medium-term challenge of attaining a sustainable fiscal position. Of course, these two challenges are mutually reinforcing: the markets’ skepticism about the medium-term fiscal position makes it more difficult to roll over debt, while the higher debt-refinancing costs make it more difficult to balance the budget. Thus, both problems have to be addressed in a credible manner. The funding problem is currently being addressed with the massive financing packages being provided by the European governments and the International Monetary Fund. The medium-term fiscal challenge will require hard decisions, painful adjustment, and perseverance. The fiscal austerity that is required in such a situation involves a painful dilemma. Such adjustment can impede the economic recovery. On the other hand, as I’ve stressed, in countries where sovereign debt concerns have become paramount, failing to adjust will have adverse financial effects – which will also harm the recovery. In theory, this dilemma could be sidestepped by committing to undertake serious adjustment only later, when the economy is stronger; but promises of future action are rarely enough to convince markets. The solution typically involves taking the bull by the horns: making a bold start with serious structural measures that will have a lasting effect on the fiscal position. The pension reforms that have been undertaken in some European countries are a good example.  But there is a problem here for the global economy. For the past several months, there has been concern about the risks associated with the “hand-off” from public demand to private demand. The concern is that if fiscal stimulus runs out before the private sector has gathered sufficient momentum, the global economic recovery could falter. This points to the need for the pace of fiscal austerity to be consistent with continued recovery.  So far, I have been focusing on two channels through which excessive sovereign debt at the global level can create risk for the financial system here in Canada – more difficult liquidity and funding conditions, and a weaker global economic outlook. These are two of the five areas of risk examined in the current FSR. I would now like to focus on a third, and related, area of risk: global macroeconomic imbalances.  Global imbalances An important backdrop to the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession was the configuration of large current account imbalances in major economies. These global imbalances were evident in the high levels of savings, and the persistent current account surpluses in China and many Asian countries, counterbalanced by the credit-fuelled spending by households and governments, and the large and persistent current account deficits in the United States and some other Western economies.  These imbalances were not the proximate cause of the crisis, but they contributed to its scope and intensity. In the years leading up to the crisis, high savings rates in surplus countries, together with inflexible exchange rates, helped to keep global interest rates low, encouraging 
4 BIS Review 88/2010 consumers and governments in some advanced economies to take on more debt than was wise. The low interest rates also led to a “search for yield”, meaning that investors and financial institutions acquired riskier assets. At the same time, debt was being repackaged in various ways – sometimes into hard-to-understand, and often illiquid, products – and distributed throughout the financial system. Many of these products then unravelled – with devastating consequences – during the crisis. Global imbalances engendered financial fragility because there were also underlying weaknesses in the financial systems of many countries – including deficiencies in supervision and regulation and inadequate risk management within financial institutions. Addressing these underlying weaknesses is one of the principal objectives of the G20 agenda. Global imbalances have narrowed significantly during the past couple of years. However, this was largely the temporary effect of the recession and the policies adopted to counter it. In the United States in particular, savings rates have increased as households have been trying to recuperate from the loss of housing and equity wealth. In China, substantial stimulus measures have boosted domestic demand – including consumer spending and infrastructure. And the sizable drop in commodity prices from their 2008 peak contributed importantly to the narrowing of global imbalances.  What is worrying, however, is that global imbalances appear to be growing once again as the recovery advances, and their nature is changing. Whereas before the crisis, these imbalances primarily corresponded to unsustainable household spending in the United States, they now increasingly reflect unsustainable government deficits in a number of countries. It is clear that what is needed is a “rotation of demand”: surplus countries need to increase their domestic spending, while deficit countries need to decrease theirs. Together with those adjustments in spending, exchange rates need to adjust – with a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against Asian currencies – to support the corresponding adjustment of external current accounts. In this regard, China’s recent decision to enhance the flexibility of its exchange rate is an important step forward; its full implementation will contribute to strong, sustainable, and balanced global economic growth. In the absence of these necessary policy changes, there are three main risks to the global financial system and to the global economy. One is that the status quo becomes increasingly untenable. If the surplus countries do not increase their domestic demand, the United States and other deficit countries will have trouble weaning their economies off fiscal stimulus. The result could be a buildup of public debt relative to the size of these economies, which could not continue indefinitely. These higher debt levels would tend to drive up long-term interest rates, by both increasing demand for available funds and by feeding concerns about how the ever-increasing debt burden would be resolved. Recently, the Bank of Canada looked at the implications of this status quo scenario for global economic growth. Following a short-term boost, global economic growth would fall steadily from the 4 per cent average of 2002–07 to below 3 per cent by 2013. In addition, macroeconomic imbalances would continue to grow, possibly setting the stage for another crisis.  A second risk is that adjustment may be lopsided. Even if the surplus countries do not expand their demand, the deficit countries may be forced by markets to reduce their fiscal deficits. In that case, there would be a deficiency of demand worldwide. With monetary policy constrained by the zero lower bound, deflation could emerge. As a result, real interest rates would increase, fiscal consolidation would be more difficult, and growth would stall.  A third risk is that exchange rates may adjust, but in a disorderly way. If increasing concerns about the U.S. current account triggered a portfolio shift away from the U.S. dollar, the resulting exchange rate adjustment could overshoot the level required to bring current accounts to sustainable levels. If that occurred, it would likely send shock waves throughout the global financial system, adversely affecting the world economy. Such an adjustment did not happen during the recent financial crisis; on the contrary, the retrenchment of risk-taking 
BIS Review 88/2010 5 that occurred led to a shift into U.S.-dollar-denominated assets, resulting in an appreciation of that currency. But disorderly exchange rate adjustment remains one of the important risks associated with global imbalances.  It is because of these risks that the G20 is placing so much emphasis on policies to achieve strong, sustainable, and balanced growth, in tandem with measures to build a more robust global financial system. The rotation of demand required to achieve such balanced global growth will require policy changes in both deficit and surplus countries. It will also involve adopting greater flexibility in exchange rates, which would facilitate adjustment to both current imbalances and future economic shocks.  How can this adjustment come about? An important step is the G20 Mutual Assessment Process, now under way, through which G20 members strive to ensure that the “policies pursued by individual G20 countries are collectively consistent with more sustainable and balanced trajectories for the global economy.”2 Each member country will submit its policies to the G20 for assessment by other members, with a view to promoting coherence among macroeconomic policies. Details of this process are now being worked out, but the most important thing is that the required policy changes be implemented, and in a timely manner. Failing that, we leave ourselves on the same unsustainable, and risky, path.  Allow me to conclude. Conclusion The financial system makes a vital contribution to our welfare. A sound financial system, one that is stable, efficient, and resilient to shocks, is crucial to a well-functioning economy.  While the world’s financial system is stronger than it was during the crisis, risks and vulnerabilities remain. The G20 agenda for financial and macroeconomic reform is sound and far-reaching. It provides a blueprint for building a sound foundation. But the time for action has arrived.  We cannot afford to be complacent. Although Canada fared relatively well in the crisis, we are not immune to risk. We must continue to make our own financial system more resilient. Together with its partners, the Bank of Canada works to do just that. The Bank will also continue its work in international forums to reduce systemic risk in the global financial system. The issues I discussed – sovereign debt and global imbalances – are important, and they must be resolved effectively, and in a timely fashion. Our future well-being is at stake.                                                  2  See “Leaders’ Statement: The Pittsburgh Summit,” available at:  http://www.pittsburghsummit.gov/mediacenter/129639.htm. 
BIS Review 88/2010 1 Thomas M Hoenig: The high cost of exceptionally low rates Speech by Mr Thomas M Hoenig, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, at the Bartlesville Federal Reserve Forum, hosted by Bartlesville Chamber of Commerce, Bartlesville, Oklahoma, 3 June 2010. *      *      * The views expressed by the author are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve System, its governors, officers or representatives. I appreciate the opportunity to join you here today. Bartlesville plays an especially important role in the history of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. After Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act nearly a century ago, a special committee was appointed to determine where the nation’s 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks would be located and what regions those banks would serve. When that committee met in Kansas City to discuss business relationships in the central United States, Frank Phillips was among those who attended and spoke in favor of locating our Bank in Kansas City and having it serve Oklahoma. The support from Mr. Phillips and others from Oklahoma was absolutely critical to the eventual decisions that established the Bank in Kansas City and included Oklahoma in the Tenth Federal Reserve District that we serve. A few years after our founding, we opened our Oklahoma City Branch. This morning, the community and business leaders who serve on the Branch’s Board of Directors – including Bartlesville’s own K. Vasudevan – met here in Bartlesville, which seems especially appropriate. This is not the only connection between the Federal Reserve’s founding and Oklahoma. The Senate sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act was one of Oklahoma’s first senators, Robert Owen. Senator Owen, like Mr. Phillips, recognized the importance of having the central bank of the United States tied directly to America’s Main Streets and not isolated in Washington or on Wall Street. That structure is at least as important today as it was a century ago. It is my hope that, after much debate, the regulatory reform legislation now under discussion in Washington will affirm in its final version the importance of these regional responsibilities. It is our job as the regional headquarters of the nation’s central bank to serve as the link between our communities and national policy deliberations. Although these policy issues are always important to our nation, today we find ourselves at a unique and difficult point. We are attempting to support an economic recovery, but in doing so, also avoid fostering the next crisis. It is this challenge that I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing and sharing with you my views. Economic outlook At this point, the U.S. economy appears on the path to recovery. Subject to the risks I will discuss a bit later, the general outlook is good. GDP grew at nearly a 4 percent pace in the second half of last year, after bottoming out last summer. I anticipate growth will be slower this year, coming in between 3 and 3½ percent. What is perhaps most encouraging now is the changing composition of growth that we are seeing. Last fall, a good portion of the GDP growth could be traced to temporary factors related to fiscal stimulus and inventory adjustments by firms that had scaled back during the worst of the recession. At that time, there was considerable uncertainty about what might happen once these temporary factors subsided. However, more recent data suggest that the recovery is more broad-based and self-sustaining, and perhaps even stronger than anticipated. Consumer spending, which makes up more than 70 percent of GDP, has been expanding at a solid pace. While consumers have been cautious about big-ticket purchases, we’re starting 
2 BIS Review 88/2010 to see some signs that this is changing as consumer confidence improves. Manufacturing activity continues its sharp rebound, and nonmanufacturing activity has been expanding as well. With businesses seeing a recovery in demand, business purchases of equipment and software have been robust. Jobs, of course, remain a critical issue. Improvements in labor markets boost household income prospects and enables Americans to take care of themselves and their families and to save for their future. So of course jobs are a crucial component in the transition to self-sustaining growth. We are now seeing clear signs that the process of job creation is taking hold. Payrolls have risen in each of the first four months of this year. In April, payrolls increased by a strong 290,000. The recent uptick in the unemployment rate from 9.7 to 9.9 percent actually reflects an improved outlook, as workers who dropped out of the job market are gaining confidence and beginning to reenter the workforce. Solid job gains in the months ahead will translate into a downward trajectory for the unemployment rate later this year and into next year. Nevertheless, while the economy is improving, recovery in certain sectors will be prolonged. Notably, the construction industry has yet to convincingly turn the corner. The residential housing market received a boost from federal homebuyer tax credits last fall and again this spring, but given the overhang of unsold homes, building activity will remain subdued through most of this year or longer. Nonresidential construction will likely continue to contract this year, due to high vacancy rates in that sector. These are important negatives but by themselves should not derail the recovery. Looking at the economy more broadly, inflation has drifted lower in recent months, which is typical following a recession. While energy prices have kept consumer price inflation around 2 percent, inflation in non-food and non-energy prices – which is core inflation – has been running at rates of around 1 percent. These inflation rates are likely to continue for the next year or so. However, as the economic recovery continues or picks up momentum, I expect inflation to drift higher. As for risks to this outlook, there are several. The fluid situation in Greece and Europe reminds us to be wary. The European debt problems have increased uncertainty and a renewed aversion to risks, and are causing investors to flee riskier assets such as stocks and junk bonds for safer assets such as U.S. Treasury debt. These shifts will have a modest negative net effect on U.S. economic growth in the near term. As an aside, I would note this episode illustrates the longer run danger of running persistent budget deficits – a situation that we must soon address in the United States. Monetary policy It is within the context of this outlook and its longer run implications that the Federal Open Market Committee must balance its objectives of supporting short-run economic growth and long-run stable growth and low inflation. It also is within the context of this outlook and these objectives that policy must be normalized, as reflected in the level of real interest rates and the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s combined balance sheet.  Achieving such multiple objectives requires deft handling. But most certainly, the first step toward a more normal policy is to move policy rates off zero, back toward neutral.  In saying this, I have no illusions about the challenges of moving away from zero. But in my judgment, the process should begin sooner to avoid the danger of having to over compensate later, as so often happens in policy. I would begin the normalization of policy by outlining for the public a two-step process: First, the Federal Reserve would continue to unwind its extraordinary policy actions implemented as a response to the financial turmoil that began in the fall of 2008. The market’s need for these facilities has eased and we have closed most of them, returning the 
BIS Review 88/2010 3 discount window to more normal operations. As part of this first step, the FOMC would also eliminate its commitment to maintaining “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.” Second, with these steps taken, with the improvements in market conditions and liquidity, and with an improving outlook, the FOMC would be prepared to raise the funds rate target to 1 percent by the end of summer. This would continue the current highly accommodative policy, but would move nominal rates away from zero and real rates to a less negative level. We would then pause, maintaining the funds rate at 1 percent while we assess the economic outlook and emerging financial conditions. This would provide time to judge whether and to what degree further policy adjustments are warranted to assure long-run financial equilibrium and stability. Based on the current outlook consensus, it seems reasonable that the economy would be well-positioned to accept this modest increase in the funds rate. As a reminder, the funds rate target remained between 1 and 2 percent even after the intensification of the crisis in the fall of 2008. It was reduced to its current target range of zero to ¼ percent in mid-December 2008. Relative to the depths of the crisis, conditions today are much improved from where we were 18 months ago. Financial stress is clearly reduced and a sustainable economic recovery appears under way. It is also important to emphasize that the 1 percent fed funds rate target, coupled with the Federal Reserve’s large balance sheet, provides an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy environment and one that would ensure the economy’s continued progress in the recovery. Setting out such a plan would be a more orderly move toward unwinding the earlier extraordinary actions and would serve to reduce the likelihood of a buildup of new financial imbalances. Let me turn now to the subsequent steps that might be taken to more fully restore policy to a long-run equilibrium policy level. Given the relatively modest expected trajectory of growth and inflation, these added moves will involve some quarters to complete. But the direction should be firmly established now with the timing dependent on the performance of a combination of financial, inflation and growth variables. Experience tells me that a clear commitment now to such action would mitigate the likely need to later tighten beyond our estimate of neutral that so often comes with delay. More specifically, these next steps involve raising the funds rate from 1 to above 3 percent reasonably quickly as we gain confidence that GDP and employment are on a steady path toward potential. The final steps would take rates to between 3.5 and 4.5 percent as economic growth approaches long-run potential. If we are to achieve a steady rate environment, it is also important that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet be restored to its pre-crisis size and composition. Obviously this requires the careful process of selling the Federal Reserve’s $1.3 trillion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. Various approaches to this can be identified but most agree that it should be done with the process or time horizon clearly set out for all to see. I also would suggest it begin at least when the fed funds rate rises above 1 percent or sooner if conditions provide the opportunity. Monetary policy and unemployment Finally, I want to spend a few minutes suggesting why it is important to move the federal funds rate off of zero even though the unemployment rate remains above 9 percent. It has been argued, with some supporting evidence, that the Federal Reserve’s commitment to very low interest rates in 2003 and 2004 was too low for too long and contributed to the housing and credit boom and subsequent busts. Between August 2002 and January 2005 – two-and-a-half years – the federal funds rate was below the rate of core inflation. Such low interest rates encourage borrowing and a buildup of 
4 BIS Review 88/2010 debt, sometimes in ways we do not fully appreciate until much later with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, low interest rates – especially with a commitment to keep them low – led banks and investors to feel “safe” in the search for yield, which involves investing in less-liquid and more risky assets. In addition, financial institutions often search for yield by increasing the amount of assets supported by each dollar of net worth – leverage. For example, leverage at securities broker dealers rose dramatically. After averaging just 13-1/4 between 1970 and 2000, leverage climbed to a high of 40 in the third quarter of 2007 – the start of the financial crisis. It was after a period of too-low interest rates, too much credit, too much leverage that the collapse of the housing bubble, the rapid deleveraging and the ensuing financial crisis occurred. And it was after these events that unemployment rose to more than 10 percent and the United States lost 8.4 million jobs. In 2010, we have only gained back 573,000 jobs. In another period, the mid-1970s and early 1980s, low interest rates also triggered an extreme swing in the economic cycle. The real fed funds rate was kept negative for a span of nearly three years, from November 1974 to September 1977. The low interest rate environment led initially to a drop in the unemployment rate. But rising inflation and asset bubbles eventually dictated a restrictive monetary policy implemented by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and his FOMC colleagues. In the end, the nation paid a high price for the low rates of the 1970s, when unemployment reached 10.8 percent in the recession of the early 1980s. In the drive to achieve price stability and stable growth, monetary policy is a powerful tool. Certainly lowering interest rates is the appropriate monetary policy response to the onset of an economic recession and rising unemployment. But it is also a blunt instrument that has a wide set of intended but also unintended consequences that can and have worsened economic outcomes including misallocation of precious resources, inflation and long-term unemployment. That is why we want to return to a sustainable long-term equilibrium policy rate, starting soon. The economy is improving and policy should reflect that fact, carefully but confidently. Although we find ourselves in a unique environment, history offers us some important lessons. If we do not learn from past mistakes, we will find ourselves repeating them yet again. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Hearing at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at a hearing at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 21 June 2010. *      *      * Dear Madam Chair, Dear Honourable Members, Since our last meeting on 22 March, the euro area has faced one of the most challenging periods since the beginning of Economic and Monetary Union. To address the unprecedented pressures in financial markets, public authorities in the European Union, including the European Central Bank, have taken bold and courageous steps. Die wichtigen Entscheidungen, die in jüngster Zeit getroffen wurden, erfordern fundierte Erklärungen und Antworten auf Fragen, die sicherlich auch in diesem Hohen Hause gestellt werden. Daher begrüße ich die Möglichkeit zum Austausch anläßlich der heutigen Anhörung ganz besonders. Je commencerai donc mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique. Je reviendrai ensuite sur la décision annoncée le 10 mai dernier de procéder à des interventions sur les marchés obligataires de la zone euro. Dans une troisième partie, je me pencherai sur les mécanismes de coordination économique de la zone euro et les changements que la situation actuelle appelle. I.  Economic and monetary developments Since the previous hearing in March, incoming data have confirmed a continuing recovery in the euro area in the first half of 2010. According to the latest estimates, the economy grew by 0.2% quarter on quarter in the first three months of this year. Looking ahead, our earlier expectations that the euro area economy would expand at a moderate rate this year and next have been confirmed. The latest projections by Eurosystem staff are broadly in line with this assessment. In our view, the risks to this outlook are broadly balanced. Nevertheless, the recovery is likely to remain uneven over time and across economies and sectors, in an environment of continued uncertainty and with tensions in some segments of the financial markets. The annual rate of inflation in the euro area stood at 1.6% in May, up slightly from 1.5% in April, mostly because of higher energy prices. We may see some further slight increases in inflation in the second half of this year. Looking further ahead, we continue to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy relevant medium-term horizon. Our monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term should be well contained. This is reflected in particular in the overall weak growth of money and credit. The annual growth rate of loans to households is continuing to strengthen, but the growth rate of loans to enterprises has remained negative, as expected in the current phase of the cycle. Suggestions that inflation might be unanchored are entirely unfounded. On the contrary, euro area inflation expectations appear to be remarkably well anchored, in line with our definition of price stability. Given the outlook for price stability and the solid anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, the Governing Council regards our monetary policy stance and the current level of key ECB interest rates as appropriate. In order to cope with tensions on the money 
2 BIS Review 87/2010 markets, the Governing Council has decided to reintroduce some of our previous non-standard measures. In particular, we have gone back to full allotment in 3-month and 6-month operations, so as to facilitate the liquidity planning of banks. And we have reactivated operations that provide liquidity in US dollars, in coordination with the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks, to prevent possible liquidity tensions. II.  The ECB’s securities markets programme Let me now turn to the Governing Council’s decision to intervene in euro area debt securities markets, announced on 10 May following abrupt and very severe increases in financial market tensions throughout the world, but especially in Europe. Those tensions were spreading to a wide range of financial market segments, including the stock market, the interbank market and the foreign exchange market. It was observed that the epicentre of these tensions lay in European debt markets, in particular those for government debt. Although the composition of the shocks that triggered the intensification of those tensions was different from that observed in October 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the United States, this situation was comparable in terms of the suddenness of the change in sentiment and the abruptness of the flight to safety by international investors. Overall volatility in markets increased sharply and liquidity conditions deteriorated significantly, not only in sovereign bond markets, but also to a critical degree in the money markets. Transactions within the interbank market declined rapidly and uncertainty among banks about counterparties’ creditworthiness increased. There was therefore a risk that the normal functioning of markets and the first link in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy between the central bank and credit institutions could become impaired. This would have meant that the ability of banks, which are the primary source of financing in the euro area, to provide credit to the real economy could have been seriously harmed. It is against this background that the ECB announced on 10 May not only the reactivation of previous non-standard measures, as well as the reactivation of the swap agreements with the Federal Reserve, but also its intervention in debt markets with the launch of the Securities Markets Programme. The single reason for acting is that it is crucial for the effective conduct of monetary policy that government bond markets function as properly as possible. The government bond markets are very important for three reasons. 1.  First, interest rates on government bonds usually set a floor for the interest rates that firms and banks have to pay when issuing their bonds. In circumstances of highly disrupted bond markets, the short-term interest rates of the central bank would no longer be passed on to households and firms, and thereby to prices, to the appropriate degree. This is what we call the price channel. 2.  Second, sharply lower bond prices implied by the much higher interest rates associated with disrupted bond markets would cause significant losses in the portfolios of financial and non-financial sectors; for banks, this would reduce their ability to provide loans to the economy. This is what we call the balance sheet channel. 3.  Third, abnormally low liquidity for government bonds would reduce their role as collateral in refinancing operations, thereby also hindering banks’ supply of loans. This is what we call the liquidity channel. The decision to start intervening in bond markets was therefore taken in order to help maintain the appropriate transmission of monetary policy to the real economy in the euro area by addressing the malfunctioning of some segments of the securities markets. 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 As the aim of the programme is not to inject additional liquidity into the banking system, we fully neutralise the bond purchases by means of specific reabsorption operations. As a result, the prevailing level of liquidity and the money market rates are not affected by the programme. In other words, our monetary policy stance is not affected, and there are no inflationary risks related to this programme. Let me emphasise that we took the decision to introduce the Securities Markets Programme fully in line with the provisions of the Treaty, only operating in the secondary markets for government bonds. We also took the decision in complete independence. We were aware of the commitments made by euro area governments prior to that weekend, on the evening of Friday 7 May. In particular, the Governing Council took note of the statement by euro area governments that they “will take all measures needed to meet [their] fiscal targets this year and the years ahead in line with excessive deficit procedures” and of the “precise additional commitments taken by some euro area governments to accelerate fiscal consolidation and ensure the sustainability of their public finances”. (Quotes from statement by euro area Heads of State or Government, Brussels, 7 May 2010) This brings me to the third issue I would like to discuss. III.  Economic governance at a crossroads You have asked me to speak about enhanced economic coordination and surveillance in the euro area. The ECB believes that a true quantum leap is needed in the framework for surveillance and adjustment of fiscal policies, as well as broader macroeconomic policies concerned with Europe’s competitiveness. “La solidarité de fait ” that Robert Schuman called for 60 years ago is reflected in the degree of economic integration and interdependence already achieved in Monetary Union. But solidarity is a two-way street. The benefits and protection that are derived from membership of Monetary Union bring with them responsibilities and obligations. This is the fundamental contract which forms the basis for our currency. We now have to turn it into a more effective structure for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance and adjustment. In line with the topics addressed by the task force chaired by European Council President van Rompuy, let me focus here on two main areas of reform. A third area, a crisis management framework, is still to be examined at the level of the task force. First, it is of the essence that the surveillance of budgetary policies be strengthened. I am pleased to note that the European Council confirmed this assessment at its meeting last Thursday. At the level of the EU27, and in particular within the euro area, we must have effective instruments to prevent – and, where necessary, correct – excessive deficits and debt levels. A more stringent implementation of rules and procedures is essential, among other things by increasing the automaticity and speed of procedural steps. The initiation of sanctions also needs to be quasi-automatic. Fiscal surveillance must be more direct and effective. It must also be based on more independent monitoring and assessment. We may need a differentiated approach to surveillance depending on the fiscal performance of countries. The Commission should have greater responsibility by making proposals, which can only be modified with unanimity in the Council, rather than mere recommendations under the Stability and Growth Pact. In the event of non-compliance, sanctions need to be applied much earlier and to be broader in scope. They should not only address excessive debt ratios, but also apply when countries are not making sufficient progress towards medium-term budgetary objectives. A wider spectrum of financial sanctions needs to be considered, along with non-financial and 
4 BIS Review 87/2010 procedural sanctions, such as more stringent reporting requirements or even a limitation or suspension of voting rights. The second area may appear more novel, both at the level of the European Union and at the level of the euro area, but the ECB has in fact been stressing it in the Eurogroup since at least 2005: the surveillance of policies to maintain Europe’s internal and external competitiveness – policies to raise productivity, to enhance people’s skills and to improve firms’ competitiveness. These policies go well beyond the tradable sector. They must also encompass the non-tradable sector, including the public sector, since it too is decisive for the competitiveness of an economy as a whole. Conscious management of wages and costs in order to maintain a healthy position for the economy within a competitive environment – this should be the core focus of such broader macroeconomic surveillance. The reason why competitiveness should be the main focus is not that countries should pursue export-oriented policies or boost international market share. The reason is that within a monetary union, the relative competitiveness of economies captures very well the sustainability of price and cost developments. I am pleased that last Thursday’s European Council confirmed the need for an effective surveillance framework in this area. Experience has shown that persistent divergence in this regard is detrimental both for Member States and for Monetary Union as a whole. As with fiscal surveillance, this framework needs to allow for targeted and differentiated surveillance and follow-up measures. For countries that experience significant losses of competitiveness, surveillance should become increasingly deep and detailed. More ad hoc reporting and dedicated country missions, policy recommendations, compliance requirements, public peer pressure and gradual financial steps to encourage compliance could all be part of that process. For this to work, we need a transparent and effective trigger mechanism to determine the intensity of vulnerabilities and surveillance. This should be based on close monitoring and reporting by both the Commission and the ECB. Experts are currently developing ways to best capture the complexity of the issue, as well as procedures by which indicators could be used in a surveillance and adjustment framework. If we can put in place effective surveillance and adjustment frameworks for both fiscal and competitiveness policies – and if we can ensure through appropriate regulation that our financial system serves the real economy and not the other way around – our European Union and our Economic and Monetary Union will exit this crisis much stronger than before and will be very well placed in the global economy. IV.  Conclusion Honourable Members, Let me conclude by saying that as we steer a course through these difficult times, we must clearly all work hard, but we must also maintain our ambition. This means that decisions need to be proportional to the importance of the Union. A single market of 500 million citizens and an Economic and Monetary Union of 330 million citizens – which are among the largest and most advanced economies in the world and which are built on solid foundations in terms of human and social capital – cannot and should not be measured according to the strengths or weaknesses of their individual components alone. Particularly as regards Economic and Monetary Union, policy-makers need to internalise what it means to be part of a monetary union, in words and in deeds. I therefore very much welcome the calls by this Parliament for ambitious reforms. The reaction of Europe in times of crisis has always been to strengthen European cohesion. I 
BIS Review 87/2010 5 would like to urge you, as Members of the European Parliament, as the representatives of Europe’s citizens, to continue to give your support to that course of action. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 George A Provopoulos: The Greek economic crisis and the euro Speech by Mr George A Provopoulos, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the Scholars Association of the Alexander S Onassis Public Benefit Foundation International Conference, Athens, 21 June 2010. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to take part in this conference on the “Financial and Economic Crisis” organised by the Scholars Association of the Onassis Foundation. Aristotle Onassis, the originator of this foundation, was, among other things, a creative thinker and a philanthropist. He arrived in Greece in the early 1920s as a refugee and, through wise decision-making and hard work, became an internationally-prominent entrepreneur. However, he never forgot his origins and, as exemplified by this foundation, passed on to future generations the ability to advance scientific and artistic knowledge. My presentation will deal with the origins of the present crisis in Europe and the lessons of the crisis for Europe’s single currency, the euro. Greece is at the epicentre of the crisis; my presentation will, therefore, highlight the Greek roots of the crisis. The origins To provide some perspective to the present situation, let us look back just a year. At that time, conferences were being held throughout Europe celebrating the tenth anniversary of the euro. Academic economists were writing articles speculating that the euro was poised to challenge the U.S. dollar as the leading international currency. What a difference a year makes! Today, analysts are writing about a possible break-up of the euro zone, a notion that, as I will explain, is absurd. Meanwhile, the euro has fallen sharply against the dollar since the beginning of this year, and the speculation that the euro will soon replace the dollar as the leading international currency has subsided. How did we come so far so fast? How could Greece, a country with only about 2 ½ per cent of euro-area GDP, cause tremors of such magnitude that they have shaken the foundations of Europe’s single currency? To answer these questions, we need to consider the basis upon which monetary union in Europe has been built. The inception of the euro zone on January 1, 1999 marked a world premiere. For the first time in history, sovereign states – eleven at that time – abandoned their own national currencies in favor of a common currency, the euro, and surrendered their monetary-policy sovereignty to a newly-created, supranational institution, the European Central Bank. All previous monetary unions among sovereign states involved at least an element of coercion. For example, the fifteen countries that comprised the former Soviet Union had no choice but to use the rouble as their currency. In the case of the euro zone, in contrast, the members willingly gave up their national currencies for the euro. The euro was adopted because a monetary union confers a number of important advantages on participating countries.  For countries with histories of high inflation, such as Greece, it lowers inflation expectations and, therefore, nominal interest rates. With lower nominal interest rates, the cost of servicing public-sector debt is reduced, facilitating fiscal adjustment and freeing resources for other uses.   With low inflation, economic horizons lengthen, encouraging borrowing and lending at longer maturities. The lengthening of horizons and the reduction in interest rates stimulate private investment and risk-taking, fostering economic growth.  
2 BIS Review 87/2010  For all participating countries, it does away with the possibility of competitive devaluations, thus boosting intra-area trade.   It introduces a common measure of value across countries, increasing price transparency and, therefore, competition.   It eliminates the costs of converting currencies, thereby facilitating trade and investment.   It eliminates exchange-rate fluctuations among participating countries, thereby reducing risk premia.   It eliminates the need of foreign-exchange reserves for intra-area transactions, thereby reducing the cost of conducting business. These advantages of a common currency exist so long as the central bank of the monetary union delivers price stability and is credible. In the case of the euro zone, the ECB quickly established its anti-inflation credentials and became credible. So much for the benefits of the euro. What about the costs? In joining the euro area, a country gives up two potential tools to adjust the domestic economy in the event of a country-specific shock. First, it loses the ability to set its own domestic monetary policy. Second, it loses the ability to change the nominal exchange rate of its currency. To compensate for the loss of these two potential tools, a country should possess the following:  relatively-low fiscal imbalances, so that fiscal policy can be used counter-cyclically in case a country-specific shock occurs, and   flexible labour and product markets, so that the country can be competitive without having to rely on changes in the exchange rate of a domestic currency to achieve and/or maintain competitiveness. The need of low fiscal imbalances and flexible labour and product markets is especially important in the euro area. Unlike the United States, for example, the euro area does not have a central fiscal authority that can redistribute fiscal resources from a low-unemployment region to a high-unemployment region to reduce the effects of asymmetric shocks. Moreover, because of language and cultural differences among European countries, labour is less mobile among euro-area countries than it is among regions of the United States. For these reasons, it is all-the-more important to have adjustment mechanisms in place at the national level in the euro zone. Low fiscal imbalances and flexible product and labour markets provide mechanisms to smooth the adjustment to shocks. Against the backdrop of these advantages and constraints of a common currency, let me describe some salient features of the Greek economy since it became the twelfth member of the euro area on January 1, 2001. The Greek economy: 2001–2009 Entry into the euro area provided Greece with an improved, stability-oriented environment. The ECB was – and is – the guardian of monetary stability. The Stability and Growth Pact was supposed to help ensure fiscal discipline. These changes in the economic environment were crucial benefits for a country that had experienced persistent budget deficits, and inflation rates that were at double-digit levels from the early-1980s until the mid-1990s. Not surprisingly, the new environment, especially the low interest rates, contributed to robust real growth rates. From 2001 through 2008, real GDP rose by an average of 3.9 per cent per year – the second-highest growth rate (after Ireland) in the euro zone – underpinned by household spending for consumption, housing investment, and business investment. Inflation, which averaged almost ten per cent in the decade prior to euro area entry, averaged only 3.4 per cent over the period 2001 through 2008. 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 On the surface, therefore, the Greek economy appeared to have entered a new era marked by robust growth and low inflation. Beneath the surface, however, long-standing problems were continuing.  Fiscal policy was pro-cyclical throughout the period 2001 through 2009, with deficits consistently exceeding the Stability Pact’s limit of 3 per cent by wide margins and no durable progress in lowering the public debt-to-GDP ratio.   Expansionary fiscal policy was mainly expenditure-driven, leading to a rise in the share of government spending; in the three years, 2006 to 2009, the share of government spending increased from 43 per cent of GDP to 50 per cent.   Although inflation in Greece during 2001 through 2009 was low by the country’s historical standards, inflation was relatively-high by euro-area standards. Inflation was, on average, more than one percentage point higher per year than in the rest of the euro area. Wage increases, adjusted for productivity changes, also exceeded the average increases in the rest of the euro area.   With both prices and wages growing at relatively high rates, competitiveness declined. In the period 2001 through 2009, competitiveness, as measured by consumer prices, declined by almost twenty per cent; as measured by unit labour costs, competitiveness declined by over 25 per cent.   With relatively high real growth rates and declining competitiveness, the current-account deficit, which already had topped 7 per cent of GDP in 2001, rose to about 14 ½ per cent of GDP in both 2007 and 2008. The large and growing fiscal and external imbalances were not sustainable. On various occasions, including the publication of our Annual Reports and our bi-annual Monetary Policy Reports, during the past several years the Bank of Greece has stressed the unsustainability of these imbalances and the need of urgent policy adjustments. Unfortunately, our calls for actions were not heeded. The present financial crisis is the outcome of the lack of policy responses to the imbalances. The crisis in the Greek economy The present financial crisis marks a third stage of the crisis that erupted in August 2007, following the collapse of the US subprime mortgage market, and escalated with the demise of Lehman’s Brothers thirteen months later. Yet, during the first two years of the global financial crisis, the Greek economy escaped relatively unscathed. There were few, if any, forewarnings that the Greek economy would become the object of the speculators’ attention. The spread between Greek and German sovereign ten-year bonds, a key indicator of relative risk as perceived by credit markets, hovered around 130 basis points during the period August through October 2009. Earlier in the year, at the height of the Lehman’s phase of the crisis, spreads had climbed to over 300 basis points. That earlier widening of spreads occurred despite the fact that markets were expecting a fiscal deficit of less than 4 per cent of GDP and a debt-to-GDP level of only about 96 per cent of GDP, figures that would be repeatedly revised upward during the remainder of the year. In the fall of 2009, two developments combined to disrupt the relative tranquility of Greek financial markets. First, in October the newly-elected Greek government announced that the 2009 fiscal deficit would be 12.7 per cent of GDP, more than double the previous government’s projection. In turn, the 12.7 per cent figure would undergo further upward revisions, bringing it up to 13.6 per cent of GDP. Second, in November 2009 Dubai World, the conglomerate owned by the government of the Gulf emirate, asked creditors for a six-month debt standstill. That news rattled financial markets around the world and led to a sharp increase in risk aversion. 
4 BIS Review 87/2010 In light of the rapid and sharp worsening of the fiscal situation in Greece, financial markets and rating agencies turned their attention to the sustainability of Greece’s fiscal and external imbalances. The previously-held notion that membership in the euro area would provide an impenetrable barrier against risk was shaken. It became clear that, while such membership provides protection against exchange-rate risk, it cannot provide protection against credit risk. The subsequent course of events has made global headlines, so I do not need to dwell on details. Allow me, however, to highlight the following.  First, in contrast to the origins of initial stage of the global crisis in August 2007, which involved a crisis in the U.S. banking sector that spilled over to the real economy, in Greece the problems posed by both the fiscal and external imbalances spilled over to the real economy. The Greek banking sector has had sound fundamentals as reflected, for example, in high capital-adequacy and Tier 1 ratios.   Second, the crisis in Greece contributed to widening spreads in other euro-area countries judged to have large fiscal and/or external imbalances. The spread of the crisis to other parts of a geographical area represents a continuation of a process observed in other recent crises, including those in Latin America in 1994/95 and in Asia in 1997/98.   Third, the commitment by the Greek government to reduce the fiscal deficit from last year’s 13.6 per cent of GDP to 8 per cent this year and below 3 per cent in 2013, and the 110-billion euro support package agreed between the Greek government and the European Commission, the ECB, and the IMF, are unprecedented in terms of magnitudes. I have no doubt that the government will take whatever measures are needed to attain its fiscal objectives to ensure fiscal sustainability. It will, however, take some time to convince the markets of the government’s determination to achieve those goals. Decades of fiscal mismanagement and faulty fiscal reporting have caused the markets to adopt Saint Thomas’s dictum: to see is to believe.   Fourth, I am also confident that the government will implement the structural reforms and privatisations that are part of the support package. These are needed to reduce excessive bureaucracy and rigidities in the labour, product and service markets that discourage investments in high-value added sectors. Allow me to say a few words about Greece’s debt situation. Some market analysts are of the opinion that Greece’s debt dynamics are unsustainable. They are wrong. They overlook the fact that a crucial element underlying the evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio is the denominator of that ratio, which includes the growth of real output. In this connection, the combination of factors comprising the support program – that is, fiscal discipline, the liberalisation of markets, privatisations, and measures to increase the efficiency of the bureaucracy – will contribute to confidence, decrease the size of the public sector, reduce interest-rate spreads, and boost competitiveness and economic growth. In turn, higher growth, along with declining fiscal deficits, will cause a reversal of the rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio observed in recent years. Moreover, fiscal discipline will add to saving, thereby supporting private investment and growth potential. These effects may not be visible immediately, but they will materialize and will revitalise the Greek economy. Some lessons What, then, are the lessons that can be drawn from the crisis? In my view, some of the key lessons concern the limits to the use of fiscal policy and are as follows.  First, the view that fiscal policy can be used in a flexible way to smooth the effects of shocks in a monetary union has been shown to be overly simplistic. As the case of Greece illustrates, the systematic use of fiscal policy in the past can lead to 
BIS Review 87/2010 5 problems of debt-sustainability, constraining the current use of fiscal policy. I need to mention that fiscal expansions in many countries with relatively-low debt levels in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman crisis were successful in lessening the impact of the dislocation in their real economies. Even in those countries, however, there is now a need for decisive actions to achieve a lasting and credible consolidation of public finances.   Second, rather than smoothing the adjustment to shocks, in Greece pro-cyclical fiscal policy has been the major source of shocks. It has led to an increase in the size of the government sector in the economy, increasing bureaucratic inefficiency and crowding-out the traded-goods sector of the economy.   Third, fiscal transfers in the face of permanent shocks can have the perverse effect of locking resources in place, and, thereby, preventing necessary adjustment. The remedy for non-competitive areas of the economy is not to channel even-larger amounts of government spending into those areas but rather to introduce structural reforms that improve overall competitiveness by allowing the transfer of resources to the more-dynamic sectors of the economy.   Fourth, as we have seen, a country with large fiscal imbalances that is in a monetary union can create negative spillover effects, raising interest rates and increasing the cost of debt servicing for other members of the union. The credibility of the ECB provides the potential of a low interest-rate environment, which can foster higher growth and employment throughout the euro area. However, as recent events have underlined, monetary policy needs to be complemented by responsible fiscal policy to maintain such a low-interest-rate environment. Conclusions As I mentioned at the outset, the euro area has the capacity to deliver enormous advantages to its members. To benefit fully from those advantages requires fiscal responsibility and open and flexible markets. It also requires a governance structure that will ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact fulfills its role as a key pillar of the euro area. The support package agreed between the Greek government and the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF provides the government with a unique opportunity to adjust the economy. The package provides a blueprint for sharply reducing fiscal imbalances and for the undertaking of structural reforms. It will set-off positive growth dynamics that will, among other things, lower the debt-to-GDP ratio. The growth potential of the Greek economy is enormous. It is my firm belief that the present crisis will prove to be the catalyst that will reshape the economy, making Greece a competitive and prosperous member of the euro zone. It is also my firm belief that it will not be long before articles again start talking about the euro’s strong position as an international currency. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 87/2010 1 José Manuel González-Páramo: Reform of the architecture of the financial system Speech by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Universidad del País Vasco, Campus de Leioa, Bilbao, 21 June 2010. *      *      * I am very grateful to Frank Dierick for his contributions to this speech and to Inês Cabral and Balázs Zsamboki for inputs. Ladies and Gentlemen, I.  Introduction It is a pleasure to be in the city of Bilbao, which hosts one of the finest modern art museums in Spain and Europe: the Guggenheim museum. With its very distinct architecture, this museum is the city’s world-famous hallmark. Much as I love the design of the building, however, I will talk today about another type of architecture, namely that of the financial system. And just like the Guggenheim building, the current reforms of the financial system stir a lot of emotions. We are dealing here with a very broad topic but I will approach it like a tourist visiting the Guggenheim museum. I will start by giving you a broad overview, describing the landscape as it were. I will briefly review the causes of the financial crisis and will run through the main initiatives that are on the plate of policy makers to prevent a crisis of such magnitude and severity ever recurring again. Then I will turn to four eye-catching initiatives:  first, the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board or ESRB, a new body that will for the first time become responsible for macro-prudential supervision in the EU;   second, how policy makers are dealing with systemically important institutions;   third, the issue of procyclicality or the dynamic interplay between the financial sector and the real economy;   fourth and last topic to which I will pay some more attention is the mandate of central banks in the area of financial stability. Let us now embark on our architectural walk! II.  Causes of the current crisis Much has been said about the root causes of the current crisis over the past three years. I will not expand on this topic but I will just mention specific factors – some of them of a macro- and others of a micro-economic nature – which in my view were key in the run up to the crisis. In the two or three years before the crisis erupted, a constellation of factors, including very favourable macro-financial conditions combined with strong growth, low inflation, ample liquidity, exceptionally low volatility across virtually all financial markets and extraordinarily low risk premia, had the effect of covering up the building up of significant imbalances. Significant financial imbalances were in the making, at various levels of the global economy and financial system. Among these were exuberant real estate prices, and a flourishing 
2 BIS Review 87/2010 securitisation business, which facilitated excessive credit growth. A group of countries  – including China, Japan, and oil-exporting economies – were saving too much, while others – such as the US – were heavily borrowing to finance consumption and investment. These developments were unsustainable in the long-run. At the same time, in an environment characterised by low interest rates, a global search for yield may have led investors to take on too much risk. On the micro side, it became apparent that market participants’ incentives were not aligned with the risks they were taking, and that some investors were not fully aware of the extent of their exposures, which contributed to the under-pricing of risk. In the banking sector in particular, deficiencies in the design of the prudential framework for banks, in the supervisory review of banks’ risk management procedures and in the rules for compensation and pay were some of the microeconomic factors leading to important vulnerabilities. III.  Regulatory and supervisory initiatives currently under discussion After witnessing the first global banking crisis since the Great Depression, it became clear that it was absolutely crucial to get the banking sector on a sound footing again. Policy makers responded rather quickly and forcefully to the crisis, which resulted in a wide-encompassing reform agenda. This reform agenda is very ambitious and time-wise rather tight, but before describing the measures under discussion, let me first briefly introduce the main actors in this area. The G20 provides the political and strategic impetus for the reforms, with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) playing an important role in the policy coordination. Various committees and working groups, of which the most prominent is the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are charged with reviewing specific international standards. As regards the reform agenda, the most important issues are the following:  the adoption of high-quality capital and liquidity standards for banks,   measures to reduce the financial system’s procyclicality,   the introduction of a regulatory framework for systemically important financial institutions,   the regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds, improving OTC derivatives markets, and   finally, sound compensation practices that support financial stability. These issues are comprehensively addressed by the Basel Committee’s reform package that aims to strengthening the banking sector’s resilience and represents a cornerstone of the response to the crisis. The package, which was released at the end of last year for consultation, aims at improving the quality and consistency of bank capital. It also considers the introduction of a non-risk-based leverage ratio as a supplementary capital measure. This leverage ratio is expected to curb excessive balance sheet growth and to set a floor for the Basel II capital requirements. In order to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical nature of financial activities, to which I will return later, the Basel Committee’s proposals also contain capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning. Finally, the proposals include global minimum liquidity risk requirements enabling credit institutions to withstand a short-term liquidity stress and aiming to ensure longer-term stability in their funding requirements. The objective of this comprehensive package is to enable financial institutions to better withstand the adverse effects of economic shocks. In order to assess the cumulative impact of the proposals, quantitative impact assessments are underway. The outcome will be available in the coming weeks, and will assist decision-makers in properly calibrating the measures. At this stage, therefore, it is premature for me to say anything about the desirable 
BIS Review 87/2010 3 calibration of the measures. Nevertheless, I am of the view that the measures are warranted from a conceptual point of view, though their cumulative impact needs to be carefully assessed. Indeed, it is important that the right balance is struck between enhancing banking stability and maintaining a stable provision of credit to the economy. IV.  What has been done? The main strands of the reform agenda I come to paint are at various stages of development. It is therefore useful to briefly run through what has already been achieved, in particular in Europe. Starting with the prudential framework for banks, most FSB members, including the EU Member States, have fully implemented the more risk-sensitive Basel II framework. Amendments to the trading book are due to be implemented no later than the end of 2011 to address the problem of excessively low capital charges for trading activities in the pre-crisis period. In the EU, the appropriate measures are included in amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive, the so-called CRD3 package. The FSB just finished its peer review on how its members implemented the agreed principles for sound compensation practices. In the EU, the CRD3 has specifically included banks’ remuneration policies in the supervisory review. An EU regulation on credit rating agencies – which will come into effect at the end of 2010 – was adopted last year. The European Commission has recently proposed amendments to the regulation which aim to introduce a centralised framework for supervision of the agencies at the EU level. Under the new supervisory framework, an European Securities and Markets Authority with oversight and supervisory powers over credit rating agencies will be established. Efforts in this field aim to address some shortcomings of the credit rating sector revealed by the crisis, such as conflicts of interest, poor rating quality and insufficient transparency about the methods used for their evaluations and the procedures for rating decisions. A legislative proposal that establishes regulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds is also under consideration in the EU. Finally the two major accounting standard setters, IASB and FASB, are continuing their efforts to achieve convergence of accounting standards, though it might not be possible to keep to the initially agreed time table. I turn now to a very important response in Europe to the crisis, which is of particular interest for the ECB: the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board or ESRB. This new body will be responsible for macro-prudential supervision in the whole EU. In contrast to micro-prudential supervision, which focuses on the financial soundness of individual institutions, macro-prudential supervision looks at the financial system as a whole. Up to the late 1990s, the predominant view of policy makers was that if individual institutions were financially sound, the financial system as a whole would also be fine. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Through various channels, institutions can be inter-linked so that problems emerging from one or some of them may spill over to the rest of the financial sector, setting in motion an adverse dynamic that affects all of them. A macro-prudential perspective, looking beyond the conditions of each institution in isolation, should help to detect and prevent such system-wide potential problems. Of course, there were already in place mechanisms for the monitoring and assessment of financial stability well before the financial crisis erupted, as evidenced by the financial stability reports published by the various central banks. But the financial crisis also demonstrated fundamental weaknesses in practices: 
4 BIS Review 87/2010  First, while various central banks engaged in their own financial stability analysis there was not really a comprehensive analysis covering the whole EU and all elements of the financial system.   Second, many of the analyses expressed serious concerns, such as the persistence of global imbalances and the investors’ hunt for higher yields, but these concerns were not sufficiently followed-up by concrete action. There is therefore a need to improve the interplay between micro- and macro-prudential supervision since many tools to correct for possible risks are in the micro-prudential realm. To this aim, the ESRB will be able to issue risk warnings and, where appropriate, recommendations and follow-up on their implementation. The legislative proposals for the establishment of the ESRB that are currently being discussed among the relevant European institutions foresee an important role for the ECB in the ESRB and we stand ready to take up this role. We will do this with the support of the other members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), the constellation of the national central banks of the European Union. The ECB will support the ESRB by providing analytical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB as well as the ESRB Secretariat. Preparatory work at the ECB is underway so that the ESRB can take up its work right after its formal establishment, which is expected for early next year. The ECB is also in the process of enhancing its own capabilities for monitoring and assessing financial stability risks, not least to provide high-quality analytical input to the ESRB. In the pursuit of this objective, we also try to draw as much as possible from synergies with existing work and resources both within the ECB and the ESCB, as well as at the supervisory authorities. I conclude on this point that the establishment of ESRB will be a watershed event in developing a macro-prudential framework for Europe. Having said that, I should also say that the ESRB does not have an easy mission and it certainly faces many challenges. Macro-prudential supervision is relatively new, which implies that a well-established framework with a clear operational objective, as we know for monetary policy, must yet be set in place. The ESRB will therefore have to develop its own thinking and strategy, and will probably have to advance in a pragmatic way. The interplay with the micro-prudential function will be crucial, not only because the ESRB will have to rely to a large extent on micro-prudential supervisors for the information and the data, but also because a number of the tools that can be expected to address potential weaknesses in the financial system are of a micro-prudential nature. In that respect, I should recall that the ESRB will not have any binding powers but will have to rely on moral suasion and peer pressure for the follow-up to its risk warnings and recommendations. And finally the ESRB will have to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in the pursuit of its tasks, given its relatively wide composition (over 60 members). V. A look into the future Taking a forward-looking perspective, I am sure that one of the important topics that will be on the ESRB’s agenda is that of the systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). These institutions are major contributors to what in the financial jargon is known as “systemic risk” and are, therefore, of great interest to macro-prudential supervisors. How to gauge the contribution of a financial institution to systemic risk, in other words how to identify a SIFI, is a very difficult task, not least because of data limitations. Nevertheless, there are a number of factors that seem to be particularly relevant, such as the size of the institution, its interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system and the degree of substitutability in the event of a failure of the critical services they provide. It is clear that any such assessment cannot be exclusively based on a quantitative approach. Rather, the informed judgment of 
BIS Review 87/2010 5 the relevant authorities, guided by internationally agreed principles, will play an important role. Indeed, the concept of systemic risk is fuzzy and still under debate, but, with a certain degree of simplification, it can be defined as the risk of an impairment in the financial system that has potentially serious negative consequences for the real economy. For example, the actual default of a major bank may seriously affect depositors’ savings (though reimbursement up to the insured level of retail deposits is to be provided by deposit insurance schemes) and the financing of otherwise profitable investment projects. But even in case of no actual default, SIFIs may pose serious challenges. Because of the potentially high damage to the financial system and the real economy in case of default, there is the expectation that governments and supervisors would not let a SIFI fail. This implicit support may provide an incentive to the institution to engage in profitable but risky activities, giving rise to “moral hazard”. It also means that a SIFI can finance itself at a lower cost compared to other similar institutions, which are not deemed to be systemically important. In short, incentives are misaligned and the playing field is distorted. These problems have probably increased in the wake of the financial crisis following some of the voluntary, and less-voluntary, marriages among institutions that have created even bigger and more complex financial groups. Reflecting these concerns, at the G20 summit of April last year in London, it was decided that SIFIs should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight. At the same time, the G20 entrusted the FSB with the task of overseeing concrete regulatory steps and monitoring their implementation. The FSB is now considering various policy options to address the concerns I mentioned. In general terms, there are two ways to address ex ante the problems that SIFIs pose: you can restrict the scope of their activities or force them to internalise the costs they pose to the system. The clearest illustration of the first approach is the discussion on the “Volcker rule” in the United States. Under this rule, banks that receive deposits would be prevented from engaging in proprietary trading, and investing in or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. I do not believe this is the most fruitful way to pursue in Europe, given the traditional strength of the universal banking model in a number of Member States. Also, there may be challenges associated with defining the borderline between the proprietary trading and servicing clients. But more importantly, the activities that are seen as deserving special attention may move outside the intensively regulated and supervised banking business, but stay within the same group. One could argue that the same effect of controlling for risks stemming from the trading business can be reached by imposing higher capital requirements on banks’ trading book activities, and this seems to be the way that is being pursued internationally. The Basel Committee has already increased the capital requirements for a number of trading book activities, and a fundamental review of the trading book is planned for next year. The Basel Committee is looking as well into how to get the SIFIs to internalise the potential costs they pose to the financial system. This can include a variety of measures, such as higher capital and liquidity requirements, more intense supervision, concentration limits, etc. Work is still under way on defining such possible measures. The FSB is expected to provide recommendations to the G20 summit of November in Seoul. An alternative way to make banks internalise the externalities they pose on the financial system is through a bank levy. A levy responds more directly to the need to raise a contribution from the financial sector in order to pay for the cost of past or future financial crises, depending on whether the levy is imposed ex-post or ex-ante. For instance, the proceeds raised by a levy can be destined to finance a dedicated fund to be activated in the future for the orderly winding down of distressed banks. The EU Commission is moving forward in this area, with the aim of establishing a common framework for a levy in the EU member states. The IMF is also finalising a report on this topic for the G20 summit later this 
6 BIS Review 87/2010 month in Toronto. In my view the discussion should be properly framed in the overall reform of the prudential framework, including the quantitative impact assessment of the various initiatives I mentioned earlier. Such a careful assessment is warranted, inter alia, to avoid imposing an undue burden on the banking sector and, ultimately, hamper the flow of credit to the real economy. Another important element of the Basel reform package is the introduction of a range of measures designed to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclicality of the financial system. In this context, mechanisms that enhance prudent and forward-looking provisioning of banks as well as the building up of sufficient capital buffers in years of economic expansion that can be drawn down at times of stress, are all under consideration. Overall, these measures aim at ensuring that the financial system functions as an absorber, rather than an amplifier of shocks, thus smoothing the volatility of the financial and real economic cycles. In setting up a more forward-looking provisioning framework, the Basel Committee works closely together with the accounting standard setters with a view to developing a sound operational framework for expected loss provisioning. In this context, let me mention as very important the collaborative efforts under way between the Basel Committee and the IASB to develop a revised expected loss model that proves operational. Concerning measures on capital buffers, the Basel Committee set forth a proposal on a capital conservation buffer that would establish certain restrictions for undercapitalised banks with regard to the distribution of earnings in the form of dividends, share buy backs and bonuses. In addition, the introduction of a counter-cyclical buffering mechanism is also considered. It would require banks to build up additional capital buffers when excessive credit growth is identified in the economy. The last topic I want to pay some attention to is the role of central banks in financial stability. The experience of the financial crisis was not only an important trigger to set in motion supervisory and regulatory reform. It also drew attention to the need to develop comprehensive financial stability frameworks in which identification and assessment of system-wide risk are translated into macro-prudential policy action. Considerable efforts are being put in place at the European and global level in discussing such a framework and how to make it operational. Central banks, on account of their experience in financial stability should be important players in the macro-prudential analytical and policy fields, as reflected in the composition of the ESRB. This should not interfere with the primary responsibility of central banks, which should inflexibly remain the maintenance of price stability. To the contrary, the successful pursuit of the primary objectives of monetary policy and macro-prudential policy should reinforce each other. In particular, measures that enhance the resilience of the financial system or that address rising financial imbalances are likely to contribute to increase the effectiveness of monetary policy by reducing the impact of financial frictions on the supply of credit. Conversely, as demonstrated in the run up to the crisis, price stability is not sufficient to safeguard financial stability, but it is certainly a necessary condition for it. Indeed, it reduces the system’s vulnerability to the build-up of financial imbalances and the scope for risk mispricing. The financial crisis has well illustrated how the monetary policy transmission channel can be seriously hampered in the absence of financial stability. This points to the many benefits from leaning against the build-up of financial imbalances, while pursuing the price stability objective. To some extent, successful macro-prudential policy could alleviate the need for monetary policy to “lean against the wind” as regards unsustainable financial trends. The two policy areas should however operate with a clearly distinct set of tools. Effective governance arrangements need to be in place, so as to maximise credibility and preserve institutional independence. 
BIS Review 87/2010 7 IV.  Conclusions Ladies and gentlemen, I started my talk with a reference to architecture and, as we progressed, I reviewed the many building sites – at various stages of development – of the reforming financial system. It will be very challenging to keep momentum in the reform agenda and to keep the activities of the many building sites on track as “battle fatigue” inevitably settles in. But the crisis has also painfully demonstrated that sound foundations are indispensable to withstand the occasional blows that hit the financial system. Therefore, it is all the more important to continue vigorously pursuing the ambitious financial reform agenda. I thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 Mario Draghi: Trade, competitiveness and Europe Opening remarks by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy and Chairman of the Financial Stability Board, at the 2nd EFIGE (European Firms in the Global Economy) Scientific Workshop and Policy Conference, Rome, 18 June 2010. *      *      * It is a honour and a pleasure for the Bank of Italy to host the second EFIGE Scientific Workshop and Policy Conference. EFIGE stands for “European Firms in the Global Economy: Internal Policies for External Competitiveness”, and no topic could be more relevant for the policy debate today: we are in the aftermath of a global recession that may have redesigned the comparative advantages of nations; that is challenging the capacity of most European economies to maintain competitiveness.  Foreign trade has been one of the main channels of contagion in the global crisis since 2008. The case of Italy is emblematic. Despite a financial structure with many strong points, from the stability of the banking system to the financial health of households and firms, Italy suffered greatly the international crisis. In 2009 Italy’s GDP contracted by 5 per cent, more than the whole euro area, more than in any other time since World War II. Despite some recovery since the second half of 2009, industrial production is still one fifth below the cyclical peak recorded in the spring of 2008. The survey of Italian firms that the Bank of Italy conducts every year has allowed us to unveil the mechanisms through which the crisis propagated within the productive system. The large and sudden fall of demand in international markets led exporting firms to sharply cut back production, investment and purchases. These direct cutbacks have spread over through the supply chain: larger firms could offload a good part of the non-diversifiable risk due to the fall in demand on small suppliers. This effect was possibly amplified by relocations and  re-internalizations of some production activities. Hence the crisis also hit firms less open to foreign trade. More broadly, the increasingly widespread international supply chains have contributed to the universal reach of the crisis, compounding the effects of distressed financial markets. It has been a big shock. Looking ahead, the point is now to understand to what extent trade flows and the geographical patterns of global production networks have been reshaped by the crisis. How has the position of individual firms and countries changed? What can the impact be of the necessary unwinding of global imbalances in the years to come?  In 2008 and 2009 several countries undertook trade-defensive measures, in particular imposing discriminatory anti-dumping duties specifically targeted against low-cost exporters, such as China. In a number of cases, developing countries have also introduced new tariff and non-tariff barriers; advanced countries have instead often turned to measures in support of the domestic sector (such as the bail-out of specific domestic industries or economic stimulus packages incorporating discriminatory clauses), with potential indirect anti-trade effects. More importantly, lack of effective political support has continued to delay the conclusion of the WTO Doha Round. Protectionism remains the wrong answer, all the more at the present juncture. Trade is a powerful engine of growth. It helps break down local monopolies, reduce prices to the benefit of consumers and firms. International competition favours productivity improvements through the reallocation of resources from less to more efficient firms and by spurring firms to innovate. This takes us to the second keyword of the EFIGE project: competitiveness. In a monetary union the lack of competitiveness causes stagnation, unemployment, and, in the long run, budgetary strains. The new European Strategy, “EU2020”, sees in competition, human capital, innovation and R&D the crucial growth-enhancing factors. These factors also interact 
2 BIS Review 86/2010 with firm productivity and size to determine a firm’s success on international markets. In the manufacturing sectors more severely hit by the crisis, the most resilient firms have been those that have been capable of shifting their sales to the most dynamic emerging markets, and those with a high degree of market power warranted by their ability to innovate and satisfy their customers’ needs.  The EFIGE project has a third important facet which is worth mentioning: its European perspective. In Europe, common cultural and historical roots, common goals and policy frameworks live together with a pervasive national heterogeneity. The diversity ranges from institutional architectures to political decision-making, to economic agents’ choices and patterns of behaviour. For analysts, this is a resource: they can compare countries and firms located in different countries to isolate the relevant differences, to learn from such differences, to identify the best practices. For policy makers it is a difficult challenge.  We must reinforce the construction of Europe: the difficult times some European countries have had this year in coping with competitiveness and fiscal crises prove that beyond any doubt. We definitely need a stricter and more coordinated budgetary discipline, but what we need above all is progress on structural reforms in order to enhance growth potential, within a renewed European Pact. That should be our ambition. 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 Amando M Tetangco: State of the Philippine economy and inauguration of a new regional branch Welcome remarks by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, on the occasion of the inauguration of the BSP Pampanga regional branch, San Fernando, 17 June 2010. *      *      * Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Secretary Gary Teves, fellow workers in government, leaders of the business community, members of the banking community, special guests, mga kabalen, good afternoon. On behalf of the members of the Monetary Board we welcome all of you to this new home of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in the City of San Fernando. We are happy and honored that you have accepted our invitation to join the inaugural ceremonies of this new landmark in Pampanga. Indeed, we should celebrate what the transfer of our Pampanga office represents – that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas needed bigger offices to support sustained growth of economic transactions here in Pampanga and in nearby provinces such as Zambales, Tarlac, and Bulacan. In fact, of the 21 regional offices and branches of the Bangko Sentral, our Pampanga branch is the second largest in terms of deposits, next only to Cebu. In addition, Region III or Central Luzon ranks the third largest in terms of net loan portfolio, after the National Capital Region and Central Visayas. This is concrete proof of the gains this region has made over the years, having overcome the setbacks wrought by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Ladies and gentlemen, let us celebrate this success with a round of applause! It is not surprising therefore that the Bangko Sentral’s recent surveys indicated that the business sector and the consumers in Region III are optimistic that even higher levels of growth and prosperity will continue to be achieved. And while the Bangko Sentral has moved to San Fernando, we remain grateful to Angeles City for supporting us in the last 23 years that we held office at the historic Pamintuan House where the first anniversary of the Philippine Republic was held and which served briefly as presidential residence of Emilio Aguinildo, the first Philippine President. For this reason, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has included the Pamintuan House in the list of real estate properties that will be turned over to the Department of Finance as property dividends. The Department of Finance in turn will transfer responsibility over the property to the National Historical Commission which will convert this into a museum. In this manner, we ensure that ownership of Pamintuan House remains with government and Angeles City will be assured that this historic landmark in its midst will be preserved for the next generations as witness to the history and heroism of our people. Ladies and gentlemen. I am also pleased to report that our country, as a whole, is also doing relatively well. While the world economy remain in distress following the worst global financial crisis in decades, the Philippine economy continued to move forward, culminating in the 7.3% GDP in the first quarter this year. The resiliency of our economy was not lost to global analysts and investors. One of the world’s biggest investment banks said the Philippines surpassed expectations, displaying 
2 BIS Review 86/2010 remarkable resilience and an impressive rebound. The pursuit of sustained economic reforms under the Administration of President Arroyo made this possible. At the same time, the Bangko Sentral as an independent institution responsible for in inflation management and banking supervision reinforced the Philippines’ macroeconomic achievements. Average annual inflation was kept at single digits dropping to 2.8 percent in 2007, the lowest annual average in 21 years. This year, the average inflation for the year is at 4.3 percent, well within the government’s target of 3.5 to 5.5 percent for 2010. The centrality of price stability, particularly in creating an environment conducive to informed consumption and investment decisions cannot be overemphasized. At the same time, our external position remains strong. Our balance of payments is in surplus in spite of a difficult environment while the country’s Gross International Reserves (GIR) is at a record high level of $48 billion and could cover more than 9 months of imports of goods, three times the standard of three months. Our healthy external position is due in part to the continued surge of Overseas Filipino remittances to historic high levels. In support of our OFs, Bangko Sentral has been working on lowering remittance charges and conducting financial education on investment opportunities and investor protection programs. Another important mandate of the BSP is maintaining financial stability, which proved its significance in the recent global economic turmoil. The financial reforms we have consistently pursued have enabled the Philippine financial system to remain resilient amidst the global financial storm. In fact, the country’s financial system has substantially improved as indicated by the uptrend in total assets, the rise in bank capital ratios, improvement in bank profitability and better non-performing loan ratios. The promotion of good governance practices, steady capitalization build-up, and continuing reforms generated positive results for the banking sector. We are also pleased to report that we continue to make good progress in integrating our countrymen into the net of the formal financial system through a program to provide financial services to the underserved as well as the unserved and unbanked. In particular, we have made inroads in improving lives through microfinance with an impressive rise in the number of clients served, in loans granted and in savings generated. In fact, the country has been recognized as one of the best in the world of microfinance by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Philippines is also in a leadership position for mobile money transfers. This is not to say that the road ahead will be easy. However, we have learned that cooperating and working together can do wonders in terms of keeping our economy on sound and stable footing in the years ahead to improve the lives of Filipinos. This, we shall continue to do as we pursue our mandate to ensure stable prices through monetary policies; a sound and stable banking system through appropriate policies and programs; as well as a safe and reliable payments system that inspires confidence in our financial system. . These topics will be discussed in greater detail in the Restrospective Forum that will follow later. Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my fellow central bankers, I thank you for joining us today on the inauguration of the Bangko Sentral’s new branch office in Pampanga. Mabuhay! 
BIS Review 86/2010 1 Njuguna Ndung’u: The agent banking model Remarks by Prof Njuguna Ndung’u, Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya, at the launch of Ecobank Kenya’s Rapid Transfer Product, Nairobi, 17 June 2010. *      *      * Mr. Peter Kanyago, Chairman, Ecobank Kenya; Mr. Anthony Okpanachi, Managing Director of Ecobank Kenya; Board Members; Management and staff; Distinguished Guests; Ladies and Gentlemen: I am delighted to have been invited to the launch of the new Rapid Transfer Product by Ecobank. I am informed that this new product will provide Ecobank customers with a fast, convenient, reliable and secure way to transfer funds at all Ecobank branches across 27 African countries, making Ecobank a truly “Pan African Bank”. Allow me at this juncture to commend the Board, Management and Staff of Ecobank Kenya for the introduction of this new product that will not only enhance customer service but also boost trade across the African continent. The launch of Rapid Transfer Product is indeed another milestone for the banking industry and demonstrates Ecobank’s commitment to financial innovation. It is noteworthy that since Ecobank Kenya’s entry into the Kenyan market in June 2008, the bank has grown its branch network from 9 to the current 20 branches including the Head Office. This indeed shows the level of confidence that the Board and the Management of Ecobank have in the Kenyan Market. Despite the various local and global turbulences experienced over the past two years, the banking sector continues to exhibit resilience and has remained strong. The impressive 2009 end year performance has been largely supported by growth in deposits, injection of capital, retention of profits and also declining costs of doing business supported by technology. During the period ended April 2010, the sector’s assets stood at Kshs.1.5 trillion, with gross loans and advances at Kshs.799.5 billion. Deposits increased to Kshs.1.1 trillion supported mainly by branch expansion, receipts from exports and remittances from abroad. At the same time, the banking sector registered a pre-tax profit of ksks19.5 billion, in the four months to April 2010 compared to Shs 48 billion in the twelve months of 2009. The sector is therefore likely to achieve better results this year compared to the previous year. Despite the impressive performance by banks, customers continue to shoulder the heavy burden of high transactional costs. This historical burden has to be dislodged now. In an effort to bring down the cost of offering financial services to the Kenyan public, Central Bank together with other stakeholders have put in place a business model aimed at broadening financial inclusion to the majority of Kenyans at a lower cost – The Agent Banking Model. It is envisaged that this model will enable banks to leverage on additional cost effective distribution channels to offer financial services. To achieve this, the Banking Act was amended through the Finance Act, 2009, to permit banks to contract third parties to provide certain banking services on their behalf. The guidelines to facilitate the rolling out of agency model were issued by the Central bank and took effect from May this year. Second, the cost of screening and monitoring existing and potential borrowers will decline with the introduction of Credit Reference Bureaus. This is the time to use this screening and monitoring technology to reach the SME in need of support to invest and expand. The Budget proposals in the Finance Bill 2010 have come up with a wonderful proposal on SME to enhance this. 
2 BIS Review 86/2010 The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has since September 2009 been implementing decisions aimed at signaling to the market the need to expand credit to the private sector at affordable interest rates. This has been achieved by way of lowering Central Bank Rate and Cash Ratio requirements. I am happy to note that the MPC decisions have started to bear fruit as evidenced by lowering of base rate by a number of major banks in Kenya, with the lowest base rate currently standing at 10%. We have room to do more, commensurate with returns on investment that banks screen and monitor. Finally, let me reiterate that Central Bank and indeed the Government of Kenya will continue to pursue policies that create conducive environment to allow the growth of the financial sector by encouraging the provision of banking services to majority of the unbanked Kenyan population and to support the real sector of the economy. We want to encourage Pan African Banks like Ecobank to have foot prints in Kenya to broaden the financial services platform. With these few remarks ladies and gentlemen, it is now my honour and pleasure to declare the Rapid Money Transfer Product officially launched.  Thank you and God bless you all. 
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Philipp Hildebrand: Economic situation and monetary conditions in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Geneva, 17 June 2010. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy. Consequently, it is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at  0.00–0.75% and intends to hold the Libor in the lower part of the target range, at around 0.25%.  The recovery of the global economy continues and the Swiss economy is benefiting from it. Although the weakening of the euro with respect to the Swiss franc is dampening export activity, this activity is being supported by growth in foreign demand. The domestic sector is still performing favourably. For 2010, the SNB is now expecting real GDP growth of about 2.0%. In view of these pleasing developments, the deflationary risk in Switzerland has largely disappeared. At the same time, uncertainty has increased since the last monetary policy assessment. The latest tensions on the financial markets, particularly with regard to the public finances of some individual countries, have increased the downside risks. Should these downside risks materialise and, via an appreciation of the Swiss franc, lead to a renewed threat of deflation, the SNB would take all the measures necessary to ensure price stability. The SNB’s conditional inflation forecast for 2010 and 2011 has increased slightly since March. It remains unchanged for 2012. Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25%, average inflation for 2010 is expected to amount to 0.9%, for 2011 to 1.0% and for 2012 to 2.2%. This forecast shows that short-term price stability is guaranteed. It also shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising medium and long-term price stability. The forecast is still associated with very considerable uncertainties. Global economic outlook I would now like to take a closer look at the economic situation and at monetary conditions. The upturn in the global economy continues, supported by economic policies which remain very accommodating. The emerging economies, in particular, are recording high GDP growth rates. The US has seen a further recovery of domestic demand and the labour market. In Europe, restrained expenditure on the part of households and companies means that economic activity remains subdued. However, positive movements in new orders and the indices for European manufacturing suggest stronger economic growth. Global growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011 have been revised upwards. The smallest revision was that for the European economy. On the one hand, more restrictive fiscal policies are likely to hold back growth in Europe. On the other hand, however, growth is supported by the depreciation of the euro and low capital market interest rates in the major EU economies. However, further developments are associated with considerable uncertainties. The biggest risk for the global economy is the continued increase in tension on financial markets, particularly due to the public finances of some individual countries. This could affect the real economy via a loss of confidence on the part of households and companies as well as through an additional burden on banks. At the same time, there are upside risks for the global economy. Domestic demand in the emerging economies and the US could, once 
2 BIS Review 85/2010 again, prove surprisingly robust. In Europe, export activity could increase more strongly than expected. Swiss economic outlook In Switzerland, the economic recovery has continued. In the first quarter of 2010, real GDP rose by 1.6% on an annualised basis, and was 2.2% above the year-back quarter. Economic activity was mainly driven by household demand and exports of goods and services.  The firming of the economic recovery led to a renewed rise in the demand for labour, and short-time work fell significantly. Since the beginning of the year, seasonally adjusted unemployment has also fallen slightly. Leading indicators for labour demand are pointing upwards. The SNB anticipates a gradual improvement in the labour market. Despite the uncertainties in connection with public finances in many countries, global economic activity is still having a supportive effect. Consequently, capacity in the export sector is likely to be increasingly better utilised. Consumption and construction investment will be supported by the improved labour market outlook and the expansionary monetary policy. The SNB expects real GDP to increase by approximately 2% for 2010 as a whole. Monetary and financial conditions The expansionary monetary policy is reflected in monetary conditions. Since last November, the three-month Libor had been held at the desired level of 0.25%. However, from mid-May it began sinking rapidly and is currently well below that level. The fall in the rate is a sign that the banking system is currently holding a very large amount of liquidity. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will talk about this in greater detail. Interest rates on the capital market have also fallen. In June, yields on 10-year Swiss Confederation bonds fell to a record level. The low capital market interest rates reflect a higher demand for Swiss government bonds. In addition, long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored. Private companies are also benefiting from low interest rates on capital markets. Credit risk premia have fallen further and rates of interest on bank loans are also at a very low level. Since the last monetary policy assessment, the Swiss franc has appreciated against the euro. It has simultaneously depreciated against the US dollar. As a result, the trade-weighted external value of the Swiss franc has only slightly increased.  The expansionary monetary policy is also reflected in the monetary aggregates. Thus, the monetary base rose to a record CHF 128.6 billion in May, and growth of the monetary aggregates is continuing at a high level. For example, M2 was growing at 10.2% in May and M3 at 7.1%. Credit growth also increased further. After slowing to 2.7% in September 2009, the rate of growth increased to 4.1% in April. This acceleration is attributable to loans not secured by mortgages, which have been growing since April. Mortgage loans grew at a rate of over 5% in April.  There are still no signs of any credit crunch in the survey on bank lending conditions conducted regularly by the SNB. The survey even provides initial indications of a possible trend reversal. During the financial crisis, a number of banks had reported a slight tightening in their loan conditions. However, in the first quarter of 2010, a few banks (for the first time) reported an easing.  We continue to observe a considerable increase in loan volumes for residential mortgages. This increase, along with movements in real estate prices, represents a risk that demands the full attention of the SNB. My colleague, Thomas Jordan, will discuss this topic in greater depth.  
BIS Review 85/2010 3 Development of the SNB’s balance sheet as a consequence of monetary policy In my following remarks, let me focus on the extraordinary development of the SNB’s balance sheet. As is the case at other central banks, the balance sheet has undergone a considerable expansion and change in its composition since the beginning of the financial crisis. By May 2010, it had nearly tripled in size to over CHF 300 billion.  This extraordinary development in the balance sheet is a direct consequence of monetary policy. The SNB had lowered interest rates sharply during the financial crisis, but by the spring of 2009, the traditional interest rate instrument was practically exhausted. Consequently – with an incipient threat of deflation – the SNB adopted unconventional measures to loosen the monetary conditions further. By carrying out long-term repo transactions and foreign exchange swaps, acquiring Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector borrowers and purchasing foreign currency, the banking system was supplied with large amounts of liquidity. In the past few months, foreign exchange purchases, in particular, have been an effective instrument for averting deflationary risks. While the liquidity created by purchasing foreign exchange and Swiss franc bonds is of a permanent nature, liquidity resulting from repos and currency swaps is temporary. It flows back automatically when transactions are not renewed. This has occurred to a large extent in the meantime.  The considerable expansion in the SNB’s balance sheet is therefore primarily attributable to the increase in foreign exchange reserves. These have more than quadrupled to just over CHF 230 billion as a result of the interventions since the beginning of the financial crisis. From today, the SNB will also be publishing information on current foreign exchange reserves on its website (www.snb.ch) at the beginning of each month.  The high level of foreign exchange reserves will inevitably increase currency risk and mean that debtors are concentrated in a few major countries. These risks ultimately represent the burden the SNB has assumed in order to protect the Swiss economy from the threat of deflation, in line with its mandate. Balance sheet risks have risen overall. The SNB is now reaping the benefits of having continuously increased its allocation to provisions in previous years. This gave it the room for manoeuvre it needed for measures in times of crisis. The higher allocation to provisions decided on recently has further strengthened the SNB’s capital base. The SNB has sufficient equity capital to withstand even large losses. In the long term, a large part of the liquidity that has been created is excess liquidity. As my colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will explain, the SNB has the necessary instruments at its disposal to withdraw this liquidity.  Inflation forecast chart I would now like to comment on the new, conditional inflation forecast in more detail. The (dashed) red curve on the chart represents the new, conditional inflation forecast. It covers the period from the second quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2013 and shows the future inflation development on the assumption of the three-month Libor remaining constant at 0.25% over the entire forecasting horizon. For purposes of comparison, the (dash-dotted) green curve shows the inflation outlook published in March, which was also based on the assumption of a three-month Libor of 0.25%.  The new forecast shows unchanged inflation prospects. However, new data have led to a slight upward revision in the inflation forecast in the short term, so that inflation arrives at nearly 1% in the second quarter of 2010. Since the oil price in the first half of 2009 was lower than in 2010, this level is due to a base effect attributable to oil prices. Thereafter, inflation is projected to remain below 1% until the second quarter of 2011. On the one hand, the base effect attributable to oil prices weakens. On the other hand, production remains below its potential. The forecast shows that – should the Libor remain at the level targeted today – inflation accelerates from the third quarter of 2011 onwards. At 2.2%, the inflation forecast for 
4 BIS Review 85/2010 2012 is the same as in the March forecast. The forecast shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising medium and long-term price stability. The forecast is still associated with very considerable uncertainties.      
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Jean-Pierre Danthine: Signals from the financial markets and developments in the implementation of Swiss monetary policy Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the half-yearly media news conference, Geneva, 17 June 2010. *      *      * As has been pointed out in the speeches of my two colleagues, reports on the economy are quite positive and indicate a faster economic recovery than anticipated. The signals from the financial markets, however, are less favourable and I will be talking about them in the first part of my remarks. I will devote the second part of my comments today to developments in the implementation of monetary policy over the last few months. These developments result from the unconventional monetary policy measures adopted by the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to combat the financial crisis and to ensure price stability in line with its mandate.  International financial markets experience an uncertain period  The period of calm which prevailed on international markets from spring 2009 onwards gave way to a new phase of uncertainty in the second quarter of 2010. Since April 2010, the climate on financial markets has deteriorated again. Share prices have fallen, credit risk has risen and instability has increased on the major foreign exchange markets. As Philipp Hildebrand has already stated, the return of uncertainty chiefly reflects investors’ doubts about the capacity of certain countries to service their debt. These doubts are reflected in a significant increase in risk premia for sovereign debt in these countries, which has prompted them to establish major cost-cutting programmes. This situation is weighing on financial markets, despite the relatively favourable reports of economic recovery at the global level. Indeed, current market uncertainty has reached a high level, although it remains lower than that observed during the recent crisis. To give an example, the VIX index (which measures uncertainty on the equity market) and the CDX index (which measures credit risk) are both rising again. However, they are still significantly lower than at the end of 2008, i.e. at the peak of the subprime crisis (cf. chart 1). The uncertainty associated with the fiscal situation of certain European countries has also triggered another rise in tension on the interbank market for US dollars. To counter this, several central banks, including the SNB, have reactivated swap facilities in cooperation with the Federal Reserve in order to provide dollar liquidity that may be required for the smooth functioning of the markets. In Switzerland, the interbank market has remained calm. Indeed, the ample supply of liquidity has reduced Swiss franc interbank rates. As can be seen in chart 2, risk premia on the Swiss franc interbank market have also declined. They fell by more than a half in May while, during the same period, US dollar risk premia on the interbank market in the US rose again. Alongside the uncertainty, investor risk aversion has grown over the last few months. As a result, there has been a movement of capital in the direction of investments that are considered to be more secure (flight to quality). This is reflected, for example, in a rise in the gold price since February 2010. In May 2010, the gold price in Swiss francs reached new heights. The flight to quality has also had consequences for Switzerland, since our country has traditionally been regarded as a safe haven for investors. This situation has been reinforced by the fact that, until now, the Swiss economy has withstood the crisis better than most developed countries. This has resulted in upward pressure on the Swiss franc, which has led to repeated interventions on the foreign exchange market. The liquidity injected into the market in the course of these interventions has reduced Swiss franc interest rates, in 
2 BIS Review 85/2010 particular for short term maturities. In addition, the yield on 10-year Swiss Confederation bonds fell to below 1.50% in May 2010. For the sake of completeness, it should be pointed out that the Swiss franc has not been the only currency to appreciate. The yen, the US dollar and the currencies of the Nordic countries have also strengthened against the euro. Investing foreign exchange reserves  As already mentioned by Philipp Hildebrand, the SNB had to implement unconventional monetary policies in order to combat the financial crisis and avert deflation risks. This resulted in an expansion in the SNB balance sheet, which took place in two stages. In the first stage, during the crisis, the SNB made use of EUR/CHF swaps, while in the second stage, when it was confronted with the appreciation of the Swiss franc, it intervened on the foreign exchange market. As part of these unconventional measures, the SNB purchased Swiss franc bonds issued by private sector Swiss borrowers and temporarily extended the terms of its repo operations. Today I am going to focus on the impact that the SNB’s interventions have on its balance sheet. In these interventions, the SNB purchased euros as well as, to a lesser extent, US dollars. These acquisitions led to a significant increase in currency reserves, which rose from CHF 95 billion in December 2009 to over CHF 230 billion at the end of May 2010. The foreign exchange acquired through SNB interventions has been placed in securities. The SNB’s investment policy is founded on the criteria of security and liquidity, but also return. In order to satisfy the requirements of security and liquidity, the SNB has focused on the purchase of liquid instruments of first-class quality. All investment activity is carried out according to a strategy based upon diversification, while also taking into account potentially major but low-probability events. A further aim of this strategy is to ensure maximum resilience of the SNB balance sheet. For the sake of completeness, let me add that, given the accumulation of additional dollar reserves, the issuance of SNB Bills initiated in February 2009 to finance the SNB stabilisation fund is no longer necessary. Consequently, the SNB will suspend its issuance of SNB USD Bills. The last auction will be held on 21 June 2010.  As has already been mentioned by Philipp Hildebrand, the extent of foreign exchange interventions are leading to a higher risk concentration for the SNB. However, monetary policy considerations remain paramount. Furthermore, we need to keep the overall picture in mind. Thus, since our portfolio is well diversified, no loss has been recorded overall since the beginning of the year. This is due, in particular, to investments in foreign currencies other than euro as well as our gold investments, which also constitute one of our main sources of risk. What is more, the important time period is the long term and over that horizon potential exchange rate losses should be offset (at least in part) by the return on foreign exchange investments. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the SNB has set aside substantial provisions to absorb any possible future losses. Transition from a liquidity deficit to excess liquidity in the financial system The unconventional measures taken by the SNB to combat the impact of the crisis and to avert deflation risks have led to an ample supply of liquidity to the financial system. Therefore, we have witnessed a gradual shift from a liquidity deficit to a situation characterised by excess liquidity. In fact, before the crisis, banks had to obtain liquidity from the SNB in order to satisfy their minimum reserve requirements. Today, they have sufficient liquidity to function without having to finance themselves via the SNB. This situation of excess liquidity is of a permanent nature. The transition from a liquidity shortage to excess liquidity does not, however, change the SNB’s monetary policy strategy, which is still aimed at stabilising the three-month Libor within the target range set by the SNB. The implementation of this strategy has nevertheless been 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 adjusted to reflect the new liquidity conditions. In times of a liquidity shortage, the SNB must supply the markets with liquidity to keep the Libor at the targeted level. If there is excess liquidity, it must drain liquidity from the market in order to keep the Libor at the same desired level (cf. chart 3). This situation can be compared with that of a driver going up a mountain pass. Driving up the hill, he pushes on the gas pedal in order keep the vehicle driving at a certain speed. On the way down, however, he must step on the brake continue to travel at the same pace. Monetary policy with SNB Bills and reverse repos The SNB is not the only central bank that finds itself in a situation of excess liquidity. The majority of central banks which have taken unconventional monetary policy measures are in the same position. Central banks have a range of measures at their disposal to reduce this excess liquidity. After analysing the different alternatives, the SNB decided to use a combination of SNB Bills and reverse repos. These instruments are perfectly in line with our monetary policy strategy. There is, however, still a range of alternative instruments available, should there be a need for them. Let me explain briefly how the method chosen by the SNB works. As I have already mentioned, the SNB aims to keep the three-month Libor within a certain target range. This rate depends on the level of liquidity in the financial markets. If there is excess liquidity, the SNB must withdraw a certain amount to influence the level of the Libor. In so doing, it uses a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, it issues SNB Bills with different terms. Banks or investors who purchase these bills pay the SNB with liquid funds, which are thus drained from the financial system. On the other hand, the SNB also makes use of reverse repos in order to complete the withdrawal of liquidity achieved by the use of SNB Bills. In a reverse repo, the SNB delivers securities to a bank in exchange for liquid funds, thereby absorbing liquidity from the financial system. Reverse repos with a term of, in general, one week are used to manage short-term liquidity. SNB Bills, on the other hand, are used to manage liquidity in the longer term (one month or more). By combining these two instruments, the SNB is able to determine the volume of liquidity it wants to drain from the system, thereby influencing the three-month Libor. The SNB continues to use a three-month Libor target range as its reference band for monetary policy. The use of SNB Bills and reverse repos  The SNB has been issuing SNB Bills since October 2008. At beginning of this month, a secondary market for buying and selling these short-term debt certificates was established. This secondary market improves market liquidity. SNB Bills have other advantages. First, their flexible terms can be adapted to the monetary policy objectives. Second, they permit greater flexibility and can be issued at high volumes. The SNB has been stepping up the issuance of SNB Bills since March 2010. It currently offers SNB bills with terms ranging from one week to three months. The total amount of SNB Bills outstanding last week amounted to about CHF 80 billion. This made it possible to reduce sight deposits to around CHF 70 billion. SNB Bills and reverse repos are characterised by their extraordinary flexibility, allowing for an efficient implementation of monetary strategy that is fully compatible with the monetary policy concept that has been proven and tested for several years now. In employing these instruments, the SNB continues to operate in an environment that is both familiar to and stable for its different partners. It is nevertheless ready to adjust its monetary policy instruments quickly, should this be required by developments in the financial markets.

BIS Review 85/2010 1 Barbro Wickman-Parak: The repo rate path – experiences three years on Speech by Ms Barbro Wickman-Parak, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Danske Bank, Stockholm, 17 June 2010. *      *      * Around three years ago the Riksbank began publishing its own forecasts for the repo rate, and there were many reasons for doing this. It made the forecasts more consistent and it was now easier to evaluate the Riksbank’s forecast in relation to those of other analysts. We were also given an opportunity to describe alternative paths for economic developments, which was a good educational tool that further contributed to increasing transparency. Publishing a whole path for the repo rate was also one step towards becoming more open and clear. It also improved the chances of steering longer term expectations . Experiences so far show that the work on the repo rate and its publication have functioned well. The monetary policy discussions focus more on long-term issues, and they now concern the whole repo rate path rather than an individual decision. This is good. Today the repo rate path is a natural part of monetary policy. Moreover, the repo rate path has served us well during the crisis, in that we could clearly signal that the interest rate was expected to remain low over a long period of time. Market participants’ expectations of the repo rate have rarely been exactly the same as the Riksbank’s expectations. My assessment so far is that the deviations have not been a problem. It is not reasonable to believe that we and the market participants will always reach the same conclusions. Inflation expectations are well-anchored around the target, which is the most important indication that the market has confidence in monetary policy. Why publish our own repo rate forecast? To put it plainly: a forecast for growth and inflation requires an assumption about the interest rate. The inflation target was introduced in 1995, and it was then assumed in the forecasts that the repo rate would be unchanged during the forecast period. This had an advantage in terms of clarification; if the forecast for inflation was that it would overshoot the target (be higher than 2 per cent) a couple of years ahead, then the repo rate would be raised, and vice versa. However, an unchanged repo rate throughout the forecast period was an unrealistic assumption. The realisation came gradually that the forecasts needed to be based on a more realistic view of the future repo rate. It was decided that the Bank would use market expectations, as reflected in implied forward rates, as a base.1 From autumn 2005 the Riksbank began working with this new assumption in its forecasts. Once this “second step” had been introduced, a further question arose. Although a future repo rate being in line with forward rates was a more realistic assumption than a constant repo rate, situations could arise where the forward rate path did not agree with what the Riksbank considered to be the “best” forecast for the repo rate. Moreover, it was difficult to communicate how “appropriate” the forward rate path was as an interest rate forecast, and the logical consequence of this was to quite simply go on to publish our own interest rate forecast. The period with implied forward rates as a forecast assumption can therefore be                                                  1  See Irma Rosenberg’s speech “The Riksbank and monetary policy” in September 2005, on the reasons for changing over to implied forward rates in the forecasts. 
2 BIS Review 85/2010 regarded as a learning process on the road towards publishing our own interest rate forecasts, which has several advantages compared with using forward rates.2  When we began publishing our own repo rate path, this was the start of a learning process for us at the Riksbank, but also for market participants. I believe that we have made a lot of progress in this direction. Monetary policy through “management of expectations” The established view today is that a large part of the monetary policy effect is through influencing expectations among participants in the economy. By publishing our own repo rate forecasts we improve the opportunities to influence rates with longer maturities by influencing the general public’s expectations of future repo rates (“management of expectations”), something that proved very useful during the financial crisis. Figure 1 shows the development of the repo rate and market rates with different maturities. We see that the Riksbank has considerable influence over developments in market rates with maturities of up to six months. The repo rate path also has significance for developments in long-term rates, although other factors than expected repo rates, such as international events, may have significance in the development of long-term interest rates. Figure 1 Interest rates at different maturities in Sweden Per cent  Note. The interest rates refer to treasury bills and government bonds.  Sources: Reuters EcoWin and the Riksbank. Greater openness and clarity from the Riksbank creates better conditions to govern expectations in the corporate and household sectors. The publication of a repo rate path can be regarded as a contribution to this. Any forecast for the Swedish economy made by any reasonable type of model also generates a forecast for the repo rate. So why should one                                                  2  See, for example, Michael Woodford (2005): “Central Bank Communication and Policy Effectiveness”, paper presented at the conference Inflation Targeting: Implementation, Communication and Effectiveness, Sveriges Riksbank. 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 then “hide the most central forecasting variable”, as my Executive Board colleague Lars Svensson put it.3  A particular advantage in publishing one’s own repo rate path is the opportunity to describe alternative scenarios for future economic developments and the consequences they would have for monetary policy. This has made it easier for market participants and households to judge how we Executive Board members will act with regard to the repo rate depending on the different alternative paths for growth and inflation. The Monetary Policy Report shows alternative scenarios, not merely for economic developments, but also for the repo rate. The alternative scenarios for the repo rate show different monetary policy alternatives. What would happen to the economy if the Riksbank followed a repo rate path that was higher or lower than that in the main scenario? The consequences of various monetary policy alternatives can thus be compared. This can systematically justify the repo rate path chosen by the Riksbank. Introduction of repo rate path not entirely uncontroversial Many people welcomed the Riksbank’s decision to introduce its own repo rate path. However, there were also some misgivings. For example, there were fears that confidence in the Riksbank might be harmed if the actual repo rate in the future deviated from the earlier forecast. This was also the type of misgiving expressed when the Riksbank began publishing forecasts for inflation and growth. In addition, there was concern that the Riksbank might hesitate to change the repo rate forecast for reasons of prestige, even if circumstances indicated this was necessary. If there were fears that the Riksbank might be unwilling to change the repo rate path when the situation required, this fear has come to nought. Autumn 2008 is a very good example of this. Now, three years after its introduction, I believe I dare say that the repo rate path is regarded as a natural part of the Riksbank’s policy. I also believe that the discussion outside of the Riksbank is characterised more by long-term discussions on monetary policy than on individual decisions.  I shall now go on to briefly describe how the repo rate forecast is produced. How is the repo rate path determined?  The publication of our repo rate forecasts makes greater demands than previously on the internal preparation work. The new method of working requires a greater interaction between the staff and the Executive Board, and the Board members are involved at an earlier stage of the process. This is made easier by members of the Executive Board being full-time employees and not merely being called together for monetary policy meetings. So what does the practical work leading to the published repo rate path actually entail? The monetary policy decision-making process normally follows an established preparatory process.4 During a number of weeks employees in the Monetary Policy Department prepare draft forecasts for economic developments, including the repo rate. After this there are meetings together with the Executive Board of the Riksbank, and a main scenario for economic developments, including the repo rate, is drawn up. Of course, the main scenario is based on a combination of model-based forecasts and assessments.                                                  3  See Lars E.O. Svensson, “Policy expectations and policy evaluations: the role of transparency and communication”, Economic Review 2010:1, Sveriges Riksbank. 4  For a more detailed description of the preparatory work prior to the monetary policy decisions, see Kerstin Hallsten and Sara Tägtström (2009): “The decision-making process – how the Executive Board of the Riksbank decides on the repo rate,” Economic Review 2009:1, Sveriges Riksbank. 
4 BIS Review 85/2010 During the forecasting process, the main scenario presented at the monetary policy meeting has in practice become a scenario that is supported by a majority of the Executive Board members. If there are any reservations against the main scenario or the monetary policy decision, these are made clear at the monetary policy meeting. Thus, the monetary policy decision is preceded by a long process. As the decision now also includes the Board’s view of the future repo rate, more in-depth and long-term discussions are required than if it was merely a question of whether or not to alter the repo rate. The repo rate path has entailed a fruitful change. The role of the repo rate path during the financial crisis When we began to make repo rate forecasts a few years ago, I do not believe anyone expected a situation like the one we had when GDP fell by 5 per cent in 2009. During the financial crisis several central banks were forced to cut their policy rates to close to zero. This has entailed restrictions on future decisions, as the nominal interest rate has a lower bound. The classical argument in favour of this lower bound is that the nominal interest rate on cash is zero, and that a negative interest rate would mean that economic agents would hoard banknotes. There are many discussions in the academic world as to whether the lower bound lies at zero or slightly below.5 I will not go in to it here, but merely note that a majority of us on the Executive Board has regarded the current repo rate as in practice being the lower bound. This zero interest rate problem received much attention in the academic world in connection with the Japanese central bank cutting its policy rate to zero as a result of the economic stagnation in the 1990s. One of the possible solutions if a central bank has cut its policy rate to its lower bound, and wants to cut it further, is to promise a policy rate around zero for a long time to come. Over time this would have a similar effect to cutting the interest rate to below zero and then raising it to above zero.  The repo rate path facilitated communication  During the financial crisis, lessons from this research became surprisingly topical for a number of countries in addition to Japan. The repo rate path fulfilled a central role here, as it enabled the Riksbank to make clear its intentions for monetary policy during an uncertain situation. When the Riksbank cut the repo rate to 0.25 per cent in July last year, the repo rate path signalled a low repo rate for a long period ahead. I believe this gave us an advantage over many other central banks, who tried to use purely verbal methods to signal that their policy rates would be low for a long time.  Credibility plays an important role in monetary policy. One central issue in this context is the inflation target. If a central bank “promises” low inflation, but the economic agents do not find this credible, it will not have the desired effect. It is possible to inspire confidence in the inflation target by the central bank being politically independent. What does this have to do with the zero interest rate problem and the repo rate path? What I mean is that the existence of a repo rate path in connection with cutting the repo rate to 0.25 per cent, provided credible evidence that a low interest rate over a long period of time was what was needed to attain                                                  5  One argument in favour of the bound possibly being below zero is that there are handling costs for cash. This would then mean that one can accept a negative interest rate to refrain from cash and invest in interest-bearing assets. See, for example, Meredith Beechey, and Heidi Elmér (2009), “The lower limit of the Riksbank’s repo rate”, Economic Commentaries no 11, 2009, Sveriges Riksbank. 
BIS Review 85/2010 5 the Riksbank’s monetary policy objective of an inflation rate close to the target, and to stabilise resource utilisation. One could say that we put our cards on the table.6  Figure 2 shows the relationship between market expectations according to forward rates and the Riksbank’s repo rate path in connection with the repo rate being cut to 0.25 per cent in July 2009. The Riksbank’s forecast indicated that the repo rate would remain at this low level until the second half of 2010. The forward rates prior to the publication of the repo rate path indicated that the repo rate would not be cut to 0.25 per cent and that increases in the repo rate would begin as early as the end of 2009. Surveys carried out by Prospera indicated that expectations were in line with the forward rates. Although the forward rates were adjusted down after the publication of the repo rate path, the pricing still showed that expectations were set at a first repo rate increase at the end of 2009. Where the Riksbank’s forecast indicated a first repo rate increase, the forward rate was already up at around 1.5 per cent. This large deviation caused considerable discussion, partly concerning the current situation and monetary policy, and partly more general as to whether it is a problem if market expectations deviate from the Riksbank’s forecast. As shown in Figure 2, however, market expectations were lower than the Riksbank’s repo rate forecast at the end of the forecast period. Seen across the entire forecast period, therefore, the average deviation is not so great. With hindsight, we can also note that in summer 2009 market expectations deviated considerably from the repo rate outcome we can see so far. Figure 2 The repo rate path and market expectations in July 2009  Per cent  Note. Market expectations are based on forward rates. “Before” are the closing rates on the day before the repo rate path was published and “After” are the closing rates on the day it was published. Prospera’s survey covers money market participants.  Sources: Reuters EcoWin, TNS SIFO Prospera and the Riksbank. A recurring phenomenon during the three years with our own repo rate path has been that market expectations of the repo rate have from time to time deviated from the Riksbank’s repo rate forecast. Allow me to comment further on this.                                                  6  In addition to the repo rate cut of 0.25 per cent, the Riksbank has granted loans at a fixed interest rate for the purpose of bringing down actual interest rates paid by companies and households. 
6 BIS Review 85/2010 Market expectations and the repo rate path As I mentioned earlier, one important purpose of publishing a repo rate path is to influence expectations among the participants in the economy. The established view at present is that monetary policy has its main impact by influencing expectations of future interest rates. A natural question here is if the Riksbank’s repo rate path has differed from other agents’ expectations of the repo rate, and how large the deviations have been. What role do the differences between market expectations and the Riksbank’s forecasts play? How large are the deviations… As we have seen, the Riksbank, the market and other economic agents can have different views on how the repo rate will develop. Sometimes the differences are small, and sometimes they are large.  Figure 3 shows two summarising measures for the deviations between market expectations according to forward rates and the Riksbank’s repo rate forecast at the time of all 18 publications.7 We can see that the deviations have become larger since the financial crisis erupted, which is natural as uncertainty increases. Looking at the whole period since 2007, however, there does not appear to be any systematic deviation in any direction (the average deviation is approximately zero for the whole period). It is important to point this out. One question that may nevertheless arise is why market expectations deviate from the Riksbank’s forecast. Figure 3 Deviations during the forecasting horizon between the repo rate path  and market expectations according to forward rates Percentage points  Note. For a description of the calculations, see footnote 7. Sources: Reuters EcoWin and the Riksbank.                                                  7  The measures show the following: at the time of a given forecast the difference between market expectations and the Riksbank’s forecast for the repo rate 1 to 12 quarters ahead are measured. This thus gives 12 different deviations for each time of publication. One measure gives the average of all 12 deviations. The other measure shows a “standard deviation”, where the sign of the deviation is unimportant.  
BIS Review 85/2010 7 …and what are they due to? To begin with, I would like to make the reservation that market expectations cannot be observed, they can only be estimated. Some of the deviations may thus be due to the fact that we have not succeeded in adjusting the forward rates for various types of premium. In addition to this, there are a number of other possible explanations for the deviations. In one sense it may be natural that market expectations deviate from the Riksbank’s repo rate forecast. Market agents may have a different picture of future inflation and economic developments as a whole, which would motivate a different repo rate in the future. Even if market agents share the Riksbank’s view of economic developments, there may well be a deviation with regard to future interest rates. This can be due to different views regarding the transmission mechanism, that is, the effects of the repo rate on the economy. Are the deviations a problem? As I mentioned earlier, one reason for publishing repo rate paths is the opportunity to effectively steer market expectations. We have seen that market expectations sometimes deviate from the Riksbank’s published path. One reason for this is that the uncertainty over future economic developments has been unusually great during the financial crisis. However, I would like to tone down the importance of the deviation between market expectations and the Riksbank’s repo rate path. There has not been any systematic deviation in either direction, if one looks as the average of the repo rate paths and market expectations over three years.  Inflation expectations are a decisive factor for credibility My view is that the decisive factor for a central bank with an inflation target is inflation expectations. Expectations should be anchored around the inflation target in the long run. I say “long run”, as inflation expectations in the short term vary considerably in accordance with actual inflation. Figure 4 shows inflation expectations 1, 2 and 5 years ahead according to Prospera’s survey for money market participants. We can see that inflation expectations 5 years ahead have been around 2 per cent during the past 10 years. I interpret this to mean that there is still unshaken confidence in the inflation target.

8 BIS Review 85/2010 I have so far discussed our experiences of publishing repo rate paths. Let me now go on to discuss the most recent repo rate path in the Monetary Policy Update published in April this year. Some aspects of the current repo rate path  Figure 5 shows the repo rate path from the Monetary Policy Update in April together with market expectations of the repo rate. For the coming year both forward rates and survey expectations were very close to the Riksbank’s forecast. Expectations as expressed in the surveys agree fairly well with the Riksbank’s forecast, even in the longer run. However, expectations according to forward rates were much lower than the Riksbank’s repo rate path in the longer run. The total deviation between the repo rate path and forward rates can also be seen on the far right in Figure 3. Figure 5 The repo rate path and market expectations in April 2010 Per cent   Note. Market expectations are based on forward rates. “Before” are the closing rates on the day before the repo rate path was published. “After” are the closing rates on the day it was published. Prospera’s survey covers money market participants. Sources: Reuters EcoWin, TNS SIFO Prospera and the Riksbank. The real repo rate path How expansionary is the monetary policy that follows on from the Riksbank’s repo rate path? One way to gain an idea of this is to look at the development of the real interest rate. The real interest rate is the most important for the development of the real economy, as it is the interest rate on which consumption and investment decisions are based. It is defined as the nominal interest rate minus expected inflation. The Riksbank also publishes forecasts for the real repo rate in its Monetary Policy Reports.  
BIS Review 85/2010 9 Figure 6 shows the Riksbank’s forecast from the April Monetary Policy Update together with different measures of market participants’ expected real repo rate.8 Let us begin by looking at the Riksbank’s forecast for the real repo rate. We can note that the real repo rate is presently below zero, and according to the Riksbank’s forecast it is not expected to be above zero until the end of this year. If the forecast proves correct, the real repo rate will have been negative for a two-year period – this is very unusual in an historical perspective. The Riksbank’s assessment is that a long-term normal level for the real repo rate is around 2 per cent.9 Seen from this perspective, the repo rate path thus indicates a very expansionary monetary policy. We have previously seen that in April the market was expecting a lower nominal repo rate in relation to the Riksbank’s forecast. Figure 6 shows that this also appeared to apply to the real repo rate. Figure 6 The Riksbank’s real repo rate forecast  Per cent   Note. See footnote 8 for a description of the calculation of the real repo rate expectations. Sources: Reuters EcoWin, TNS SIFO Prospera and the Riksbank.                                                  8  The real repo rate forecast is calculated as a mean value of the Riksbank’s repo rate forecast for the coming year minus the inflation forecast (CPIF) for the corresponding period. Prospera’s interest rate and inflation expectations are based on surveys carried out on 28 April and 28 April–7 May respectively. Interpolation has been used for the interest rate and inflation expectations to produce the expected repo rate for the coming year and inflation expectations for the corresponding period. “Forward rates minus Prospera inflation expectations” shows nominal forward rates from 28 April for the coming year minus inflation expectations according to Prospera for the corresponding period. 9  See the box “What is a normal level for the repo rate?” in the Monetary Policy Report, February 2010 for a discussion of a normal level for the repo rate. See also Björn Lagerwall “Real interest rates in Sweden”, Economic commentary no. 5, 2008, Sveriges Riksbank, for a discussion of real interest rates. 
10 BIS Review 85/2010 Concluding thoughts Publishing our own repo rate path was a further step towards openness and transparency in the Riksbank’s monetary policy. Our forecast for the repo rate is reported in the same way as other important forecast variables. We can also use alternative scenarios to illustrate how the Executive Board may respond with its monetary policy if economic developments deviate from the main scenario.  When the Riksbank introduced the repo rate path there were fears that many analysts would stop making their own forecasts and slavishly follow the Riksbank. The merit of having many different assessments would be lost. However, this has not been the case. There was also concern that we would avoid changing the repo rate path, even when this was motivated by changed conditions. This has not happened either. “The repo rate path is a forecast, not a promise”, this has been a message that the Riksbank has communicated all along.  Experiences so far show that the work on the repo rate path and publication of the path have functioned well. To crown it all, we have gained a monetary policy discussion that is aimed more at long-term issues and not merely at whether or not the interest rate should be altered a stage. My view is that our own repo rate path is quite clearly preferable to the other two alternatives that were tested. I believe that this is also the predominant view of most of those outside of the bank, now, three years later.  The repo rate path served us well during the crisis. We were able to clearly signal that the repo rate will be low for a long period of time to alleviate the effects of the fall in demand and to attain the inflation target. There have been slight differences of opinion among us Executive Board members with regard to the time when an increase in the repo rate will begin. But these have been only slight, the larger moves have been clear. It has been necessary to have a low repo rate over a long period of time. In this context, changes in the repo rate amounting to 0.25 percentage points slightly sooner or later do not make a significant difference. According to our repo rate forecast in April, the real repo rate will have been below zero for two years, and it will remain low throughout the forecast period.  There have been and are differences between the market agents’ expected repo rate and the repo rate path. However, there are also difficulties in measuring market expectations through forward rates. This applies in normal cases and even more so in times of financial crisis. Even if it is the case, we can probably note that the differences have been rather the rule than the exception. There has been no systematic deviation in any one direction. All in all, I think that with the aid of the repo rate path we have succeeded relatively well in steering expectations. In connection with the introduction of the repo rate path, there were discussions as to whether there would be a confidence crisis if the market does not “buy” our repo rate path. But, as shown, this does not need to be an expression of mistrust. And talking about confidence, my view is that the final proof that households and companies have confidence in the Riksbank’s monetary policy is that inflation expectations are anchored close to the target of two per cent. Surveys indicate clearly that inflation expectations in the long run are very well anchored around the inflation target. I interpret this to mean that the general public has confidence that the Riksbank will adapt its monetary policy to attain the inflation target. 
BIS Review 85/2010 1 Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: The role of regulators when markets fail Speech by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the conference on the Squam Lake Report “Fixing the Financial System”, New York City, 16 June 2010. *      *      * I wish to thank Marco Protopapa, Olya Ranguelova, and Fabio Recine for their contributions to this speech.  I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein. Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the Squam Lake Report in front of such a distinguished audience. The report offers valuable insights into how to improve the financial regulatory and supervisory architecture, with the aim of achieving a more resilient financial system. In my comments today, I would like to highlight three important points in this area: i) the reform of capital requirements, ii) the role of proper supervision and regulation, with a focus on the changes needed to achieve greater effectiveness, and iii) the regulation of executive compensation in financial services. 1. Capital requirements and the role of supervision Let me start with the main pillar of banking regulation, i.e. capital requirements. The Squam Lake Report makes three recommendations. Capital requirements should: i) be higher for larger banks; ii) depend on the liquidity of the assets held by a bank; and iii) increase in proportion to a bank’s short-term debt. The recommendations examine three of the most prominent elements that have characterised the crisis: the build-up of systemic risk, which has been exacerbated by the behaviour of large and complex financial institutions; the price spirals triggered by the fire sale of illiquid assets under distressed market conditions; and the fragility of a business model based on widespread recourse to short-term financing. The main thrust of these recommendations has been high on the post-crisis regulatory agenda. Allow me to briefly recount the most relevant features of the ongoing reform of the financial sector at the international level.  First, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) is investigating the options for introducing regulations covering the specific risks related to large and complex systemic financial institutions. Systemic institutions, by definition, entail higher interconnectedness. They increase the complexity and fragility of the system; they end up amplifying the inherent pro-cyclicality of the financial system and lead to the materialisation of systemic risk. In a downswing, the intensity of deleveraging, liquidity hoarding and asset fire sales is proportional to the size of an institution’s balance sheet, as the Squam Lake Report notes, but also to its interconnectedness and opacity. Against this background, regulators are working to devise measures of systemic importance based on a combination of factors such as size, substitutability and interconnectedness, which could be drawn on to calibrate additional prudential requirements, for instance a surcharge.  
2 BIS Review 85/2010 Turning to the core of prudential regulation, in December 2009, the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision (BCBS), under the aegis of the G20, proposed a major overhaul1 of the micro-prudential framework. There is a consensus that in the years prior to the crisis financial institutions were operating with too little capital, with excessive leverage and with insufficient recognition of the risks undertaken – including liquidity risk. The Basel Committee’s proposals envisage: raising the quality and quantity of capital2, strengthening risk coverage3, and introducing a non-risk-based leverage ratio4 as well as a regime of countercyclical capital buffers. Importantly, the new rules will comprise a novel, harmonised treatment for liquidity risk. Rather than imposing capital requirements based on the liquidity of assets, the Committee has opted for specific quantitative provisions (outright liquidity ratios) for directly promoting stronger liquidity buffers. In particular, banks will be required to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand episodes of financial stress as well as to shift towards more stable sources of funds on the liability side. A substantive advantage of the liquidity framework proposed by the Basel Committee is its ability to improve the management of liquidity risk, which is inherently a cash flow risk and cannot be fully addressed via liquidity-based capital requirements only. The chosen option directly gears both the assets and liability mix towards, respectively, higher liquidity and more structural (longer-term) composition, also providing observable and verifiable metrics for the purposes of rigorous monitoring. By doing so, it explicitly promotes prudent liquidity risk management, thus minimising the likelihood of unexpected liquidity shortages, which may be covered only at prohibitively high cost at times of distress.  Agreement has been reached at G20 level that the new standards will be phased in as financial conditions improve and the economic recovery firms up, with implementation envisaged by end-2012. The Basel Committee will also consider appropriate transition and grandfathering arrangements. Given the scope of the reform, I wish to emphasise that regulators and central bankers are fully aware of the importance of a thorough assessment of its overall impact, including the interaction between different rules and the potential consequences for financial intermediation and for the real economy. In this context, the Basel Committee and the FSB are carrying out both a bottom-up (focused on the impact on the institutions’ balance sheets) and a top-down macroeconomic impact assessment5. The first results of these exercises are expected to be available next month. The BCBS will issue by the end of this year a fully calibrated, comprehensive set of measures based on the outcome of this work . The bottom-up impact assessment will provide policy-makers with guidance on the proper calibration of the proposed measures as well as form a basis for establishing a credible minimum after cumulating the effects of the changes, taking into account their interactions. The top-down assessment will inform the decision on the overall level of minimum capital requirements the system should hold, while also gauging the long-term benefits of a safer financial system. It will also deliver insights into the impact of the new capital standards on                                                  1  The reform package comprises two consultative documents entitled: “Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector” and “International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring”. 2  The new rules recognise common equity as the highest quality component of capital. 3  The introduction of capital requirements for counterparty risk exposures arising from derivatives and securities financing activities is being proposed, as are incentives for the central clearing of over-the-counter derivatives. These measures complement the higher capital charges for trading book exposures and securitisations that were adopted in July 2009. 4  The leverage ratio, covering also off-balance sheets items, is envisaged to act as a backstop measure to curb excessive balance sheet growth. 5  The ECB is a key contributor to the top-down macroeconomic impact, focusing on the euro area. 
BIS Review 85/2010 3 credit availability, ensuring that the introduction of the proposed measures will not hamper credit extension or affect economic growth. Estimates of the macroeconomic impact are still in progress and thus it is too early to draw solid conclusions. But – I should add – it has recently been suggested6 that the impact of the Basel Committee reforms on growth may be limited, especially when compared with figures circulated by the industry, which tend to be based on somewhat extreme assumptions. In particular, it has been observed that there are reasons to expect a relatively smooth balance sheet adjustment by the banking system and therefore a less pronounced macroeconomic impact. First, the impact of the new liquidity rules may be significantly mitigated by adjustments to both the composition and the maturity of the balance sheet: for instance, lengthening the maturity of the liabilities to better match that of the assets would likely result in lower riskiness overall and thus lower funding costs. Second, the investors’ required rate of return on banks’ equity and other sources of funding, such as long-term bonds, can be expected to decline, reflecting a lower risk for share and bondholders resulting from the enhanced resilience and safety of banks, hence decreasing the cost to banks.  Nevertheless, macroeconomic conditions and the health of banks’ balance sheets would still be relevant factors when deciding on proper implementation arrangements. With regard to the latter, I would also like to comment on the crucial role of international coordination and cooperation for the success of the regulatory efforts to shape a better prudential framework. Large and complex financial institutions are global players and thus require a global response. In this context, international collaboration between the authorities and a strong commitment to enforce a timely and harmonised implementation will be of the essence to promote a level playing field and prevent international regulatory arbitrage. Strengthened cooperation has already taken place at the level of policy-making bodies such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the context of the implementation of the G20 regulatory reform agenda. This has fostered convergence, on both sides of the Atlantic, in the approaches to bolstering the national frameworks. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that at the outset of the crisis, while the EU legislation already reflected the amendments referred to in the Basel accord, the US committed to do so by 2011. I am confident that the US authorities will live up to their commitment and will take the necessary steps to further enrich their national framework so as to take into account the latest proposals formulated by the Basel Committee. I would also point out that Europe is currently working on strengthening its legislative framework in respect of issues such as a bank levy or broadening the scope of regulation to hedge funds and credit ratings agencies. Although similar initiatives are under way in the US, I would like to point out that, by contrast, our approach does not aim to limit the size of systemically important financial institutions, but rather to strengthen their supervisory framework through the implementation of internationally agreed principles.  2. Effective and comprehensive supervision and regulation The final result of the reform of the international regulatory architecture will be a financial system with more and better-quality capital, enforced by appropriate micro-prudential standards. Yet there’s a question we cannot avoid: would a stronger micro-prudential framework be enough to prevent a repetition of the events we experienced during the financial crisis?  I don’t think so. Higher and better capital and liquidity requirements are an essential condition to improve the stability of the financial sector. But they are not a sufficient condition per se, if not accompanied by a sweeping change in the orientation and practice of micro-prudential                                                  6  See “Bankers’ ‘doomsday scenarios’ under fire”, Financial Times, 30 May 2010. 
4 BIS Review 85/2010 oversight. I believe that one of the most crucial lessons to be drawn from the crisis concerns the twin failures of: i) light-touch regulation, and ii) the narrow perimeter of regulation and supervision, excessively focused on the banking system and on the legal status of the supervised entities.  We have observed many instances of supervisory failure in which supervisors did not fully understand the business models of the institutions they were overseeing or the nature, scope and location of the underlying risks. This has largely been due to the light-touch model of regulation and supervision, which has been proven ineffective because it failed to keep pace with financial innovation and with the financial sector’s capacity to dynamically alter the profile and the location of its risk exposures. I am convinced that the main failing of light-touch regulation and supervision lies in its overwhelming reliance on rules. Too much emphasis is placed on monitoring a mostly formal compliance with the rules. In other words, the light-touch approach to supervision is ineffective because it failed to recognise the powerful incentives of financial institutions to game what on the surface appeared to be well-intentioned and granular requirements.  Historical experience has demonstrated that supervisory emphasis on mechanical rules such as capital requirements may encourage perverse behaviour that ultimately leads to excessive risk-taking. Why is this? In the absence of adequate supervision, banks have incentives and opportunities to game the rules by developing financial innovations that allow a shifting of risk beyond the perimeter of the regulated sector and by devising novel strategies which increase their exposure to risks but which, on the surface, appear compliant with the rules.  Since the introduction of the Basel Accord in 1988, supervisory authorities have been equipped with the tools of risk-based supervision, as underpinned by capital rules. Over time, and in many respects as an attempt to arbitrage away prudential requirements and gain capital relief, financial institutions began packaging their exposures, shifting them to off-balance sheet entities and distributing them across the financial system. As a consequence, aided by the development of financial derivatives and structured products, a seamless transition to the “originate and distribute” business model took place, alongside the growth of the shadow banking system. It would not be correct to say that such a fundamental shift went ignored by supervisors. In fact, it was even regarded7 – often with the approval of academics and central bankers – as a highly positive improvement in the risk-transfer capacity of the system, while the system-wide effects it was producing on risk-taking, lending standards and risk management went unheeded. Overall, the dangers associated with the migration of risks to less regulated and thus less capitalised parts of the financial sector – the shadow banking system – were largely neglected. The received wisdom mistakenly saw the shadow banking system as a club of sophisticated market participants, in principle detached from the core of the traditional banking system and free to operate without appropriate rules and oversight. Now we know that this perception was not only incorrect, in that the shadow banking system turned out to trigger far-reaching systemic effects, but also that it fostered, through herding pressure behaviour, the widespread adoption of dangerous financial strategies and activities. Indeed, even traditionally regulated financial institutions took advantage of the regulators’ passivity, perhaps best exemplified by the lack of regulation for the burgeoning credit derivatives market, by taking on risks that the regulators were only dimly aware of. The recourse to leveraged trading exposures8, already incentivised by the preferential regulatory treatment of                                                  7  For a prescient contrarian view, see Rajan, R.

BIS Review 85/2010 5 the trading book as compared with the banking book, ultimately fostered the retention of larger and larger senior tranches of asset-backed securities and CDOs and to the proliferation of vehicles such as ABCP conduits and SIVs. In this respect, the failings of light-touch regulation and the short-sighted focus on the banking system appear overwhelmingly clear. On the one hand, the tail risks hidden in the payoff profiles of highly rated securitisations were not understood by financial supervisors. On the other hand, the migration of risks outside the traditional banking sector into a thinly capitalised shadow banking system lacked appropriate oversight.  This process resulted in a weakening of the prudential rules, a sharp deterioration in bank capital, an overall decline in lending standards, an unsustainable growth of leverage, a persistent under-appreciation of risks and, ultimately, in an unprecedented degree of fragility and interdependence in the financial system. Looking ahead, supervision will have to move towards taking a proactive and forward-looking approach. Likewise, the regulatory net needs to be cast wide enough to encompass all financial institutions and activities capable of generating systemic effects. Finally, an assessment must be made of how the supervisory authorities applied the tools available to them and whether their decisions were taken on the basis of an independent judgement or were somehow influenced by external factors. Historical experience offers ample evidence that inadequate arrangements as regards the independence of the supervisory authorities contributed to the emergence of financial instability. The East Asian crisis of 1997–1998 is a frequently quoted example of weak regulations and forbearance, resulting from political interference in supervisory activity and leading to a financial crisis.  Institutional arrangements should ensure that supervisors are independent from the political authorities and not at risk of regulatory capture by the supervised institutions. In some cases the desire to enhance the competitiveness of domestic financial institutions may have influenced decisions that allowed such institutions to behave in a less prudent manner. These are important issues, and should be part of the international debate on how to enforce effective supervision so as to strengthen the capacity to mitigate future financial crises. 3. Compensation of top executives  Let me now turn to the topic of executive compensation. Remuneration of top executives has recently attracted special attention, notably in the financial sector, where the distribution of sizeable severance payments, entirely disconnected from the institutions’ performance, has caused a public outcry. Moreover, the financial crisis has revealed that inappropriately designed compensation mechanisms could lead to excessive risk-taking and should therefore be subject to policy intervention. The Principles for Sound Compensation Practices elaborated by the FSB has been a crucial step forward in this regard. Input from academia will be essential to refine this framework. In this respect, the emphasis in the Squam Lake Report on executive compensation is of interest, especially as it concerns an area which has not yet been fully addressed at the international level9.  I broadly agree with the report’s first idea, namely that governments should not regulate the absolute levels of executive compensation in financial institutions. On that point, I would like to make the following remarks.                                                  9  At the present juncture, the principles and standards for sound compensation practices have mainly been designed to apply to a relatively large range of employees, i.e. those “categories of staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the bank’s risk profile” (see “Compensation Principles and Standards – Assessment Methodology”, January 2010, BCBS). These categories include senior managers and others; material risk-takers (e.g. traders) and staff performing important risk management and control functions are also targeted by the framework. 
6 BIS Review 85/2010 First, as a matter of fact, the average level of executive remuneration has substantially increased10 in recent years. While this trend is perceived by some stakeholders to be a problem, it is not necessarily evidence of economic inefficiency. However, the financial and economic crisis has highlighted not only the high level of executive pay, but also a mismatch between executive pay and performance. The payment of very high salaries, bonuses and severance payments to executives while companies are underperforming and banks are being bailed out by taxpayers’ money could be seen as evidence of inadequately designed compensation schemes. Second, I would like to comment on the idea in the report that “market prices are typically the best way to allocate resources”. In my view, the precise scope of such a statement should be carefully specified. Indeed, it has been recently pointed out that the importance of factors other than the ones usually associated with “free” market conditions (productivity, competition, initiative, talent), such as executives’ bargaining power and tactics to influence their pay levels, should not be overlooked. This seems to be particularly true in the case of large lump-sum payments such as the “golden parachutes”. In this context, although I believe that direct intervention by governments in the absolute levels of executive compensation is not desirable, national authorities and policy-makers should monitor their evolution. Furthermore, an indirect public intervention may, in some cases, be justified. The setting of limits on severance pay with respect to the fixed component of the remuneration and the banning of severance pay in case of failure are two examples in this respect. The European Commission11 took this approach in its recommendation issued in April 200912. Overall, the boundary between the change in the structure and the level of executive pay is rather blurred. The Squam Lake Report also argues that the structure – and form – of executive compensation should not only aim to eliminate excessive risk-taking but also to reduce the possibility of taxpayers’ bailouts. In short, it should address the anomaly of gains being privatised and losses being socialised during the financial crisis. Withholding a fraction of an executive’s compensation for a number of years and not paying it if the firm goes bankrupt or receives significant government support should help to align the incentives of managers with those of taxpayers and reduce excessive risk-taking. Such an approach is relatively new in comparison with the measures developed so far at the international level (e.g. deferral arrangements, clawback/malus provisions), which essentially seek to align individual incentives with those of the institutions’ shareholders. The BCBS proposal13 will introduce a framework that will give supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector with payout restrictions. Measures to defer compensation are important, but they have at least one major drawback. It is very difficult to compute the “right” time span between the peaks and troughs of a cycle. For instance, the report proposes to defer (a part of the) compensation for five years. Although such a period is longer than the minimum deferral period of three years targeted by                                                  10  For evidence on remuneration in the financial sector, see Philippon T. and A. Reshef (2009), “Wages and Human Capital in the U.S. Financial Industry: 1909–2006”, NBER Working Paper No. 14644, January. 11  Note that the underlying logic of the European Commission approach is aligned with the FSB’s Implementation Standard 12, according to which “Existing contractual payments related to a termination of employment should be re-examined […]; prospectively, any such payments should be related to performance achieved over time and designed in a way that does not reward failure”. 12  See Commission Recommendation of 30 April 2009, complementing Recommendations 2004/913/EC and 2005/162/EC as regards the regime for the remuneration of directors of listed companies. According to the Recommendation, termination payments should be limited to a certain amount or duration beforehand, which, in general, should not be more than two years’ annual remuneration (on the basis of only the non-variable component of the annual remuneration). 13  “Strengthening the resilience of the banking sector”, December 2009, BCBS. 
BIS Review 85/2010 7 the FSB Implementation Standards, some of the groups responsible for packaging structured products which caused billions of losses for the financial system have earned substantial fees for more than five years. It is therefore essential that such deferral arrangements, which function as the first risk adjustment mechanism, incorporate measures linking the deferral payment to future performance within a reasonable time horizon. From a more general perspective, it is important to recall that agency costs and excessive risk-taking behaviours can be traced back to unsatisfactory corporate governance and regulatory frameworks as well as to shortcomings in the design of compensation plans. In this regard, the use of stocks and stock options in the remuneration packages did not alleviate the agency costs imposed on the shareholders during the market turmoil. This circumstance highlights the need for policy-makers to promote longer stock holding periods and stricter forfeiture rules so as to make these instruments more capable of providing incentives for long-term value creation. In addition, rather than maximising the return on equity, the compensation structure should encourage the maximisation of the return on assets, i.e. the total value of the firm, as this would help to curb excessive risk-taking and leverage. Profit centres should also be provided with long-term incentives in order to avoid creating “fake alpha”. To this end14, financial institutions should have in place independent risk management functions with sufficient authority to lean on the decision-making process. It is essential that risk managers are not isolated from the business lines they oversee and that they have access to the necessary information. Their analyses should be communicated to the Board and top executives in a comprehensive and comprehensible manner (with a forward-looking view of the risks taken). Shareholders and Board members should also have sufficient knowledge and expertise relevant to the financial activities the institution is pursuing to permit effective governance. Transparency in compensation packages should perhaps also be encouraged. Conclusion The financial crisis has exposed major shortcomings in micro-prudential regulation and supervision. A sweeping reform of the rules, in particular of capital adequacy and liquidity requirements, is in the making. It’s needed, but it’s not enough. The supervisory orientation has to shift from a light-touch approach to one that is more proactive, forward-looking and at times necessarily intrusive, as an indispensable complement to the rules. Supervisors need to look more closely at the business and strategic risks of systemic institutions, gaining full knowledge of the strategies pursued and the sources of excess returns. Supervisors should also be able to gain access to all the parts of the group, regardless of the legal status of the supervised entity. Furthermore, regulators and supervisors have to be alert to the fact that financial innovation, by adding layers of leverage, complexity and opacity, can transform the risk profile of even traditionally safe assets.  At the same time, the regulatory net must be extended to the whole range of leveraged institutions which can trigger systemic risk, including the shadow banking system and other firms that pose potential systemic risks such as hedge funds. Any changes in the regulatory framework must be carefully scrutinised so as to minimise the risks of regulatory arbitrage and not provide incentives to transfer certain types of systemically relevant risk beyond the perimeter of the regulated sector. Higher prudential requirements, whether inside or outside the banking system, should be imposed on riskier activities, regardless of their location.                                                  14  The following developments are in line with the BCBS “Principles for enhancing corporate governance”, issued in March 2010. 
8 BIS Review 85/2010 Furthermore, changes to the prevailing practices in executive compensation are needed. An effective – and stringent – executive compensation framework should be designed to ensure that managers, who play a key role in defining their institutions’ risk strategies, are not rewarded for artificial excess returns, such as those stemming from positions whose risks have not yet materialised. In addition, enhanced supervisory cooperation, especially between major financial centres, as well as an extension of the coverage of the international framework, to all the financial services institutions, notwithstanding their legal status, is essential. 
BIS Review 84/2010 1 Mervyn King: Monetary policy developments Speech by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s Banquet for Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, London, 16 June 2010. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Mr Chancellor, My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, May I join the Lord Mayor in welcoming you, Chancellor, to your first Mansion House Dinner? You have set a rapid pace in your first month in office, not least in your announcements this evening. In previous years I have sometimes set this gathering a quiz question. Tonight I want to reverse the process by providing the answer and asking you for the question. The answer is 23, and later I shall ask you – to what question is 23 the answer? Over the past year, there has been no slackening in the pace of economic and political upheaval. The financial crisis that began in 2007 is not yet over. Much of the recent market volatility reflects concerns about the ability of governments to service their own debt and provide assistance where necessary to weakened banking systems, especially in the euro area. Such risks have the potential to derail recovery and we cannot ignore them. At home we face the challenge of ensuring recovery while rebalancing the economy, reducing the fiscal deficit, and reshaping the structure and regulation of our banking system. In playing its part to meet this challenge, the Bank of England has two priorities. Our first priority must be to maintain low and stable inflation. Of late there have been those who doubt our ability or willingness to meet the inflation target. In May, CPI inflation was 3.4%, and for much of the past three years has been above the 2% target. Over that period the rise in prices in excess of that implied by the target was around 3%. That can be accounted for by the direct impact on the price level of the fall in sterling’s effective exchange rate, of about 25%, which is supporting the rebalancing of the UK economy. Inflation has not only been higher than in the previous decade; it has also been more volatile. Our ability to keep measured inflation close to the target has been hindered by movements in world oil and commodity prices, as well as the temporary reduction in VAT. Oil prices, for example, have gyrated between $40 and $150 a barrel. Although such price changes clearly lead to higher or lower CPI inflation for a period, by themselves they do not generate the continuous rise in prices to which monetary policy should respond. A continuous rise in prices would ordinarily be associated with strong money growth, wage inflation, rapid increases in money spending and an excess of demand over the supply capacity of the economy. The UK economy exhibits none of these traits – annual broad money growth is around 1%, growth in regular pay is close to 2% and money spending growth is around 3%; all of which are significantly lower than the average growth rates recorded before the crisis. And a range of indicators point to spare capacity in the economy rather than excess demand. Perhaps most obviously, unemployment is around 8%, three percentage points above the average levels before the crisis – a million fewer people in work. The Monetary Policy Committee judges that it is likely, though not certain, that this spare capacity will press down on inflation. That seems to be happening in both the United States and the euro area where underlying inflation is falling. No one should take this as a sign of complacency. The MPC is conscious that there are always risks to the upside, and the apparent rise in inflation expectations is one that concerns us. We have always explicitly recognised that there is a significant chance that inflation may turn out to be above target. A forecast is not a single number; it is an assessment of risks. In our May forecast, the MPC judged that, under prevailing market interest rates, the odds were in favour of inflation remaining above target over the next year, 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 whereas, looking two to three years ahead, the odds were on inflation being below the target. There are always risks to the outlook – on both sides – and to ignore them in either direction would be foolish. What the MPC must do is continually update its assessment of those risks, and set policy in order that, on balance, inflation remains on track to meet the target in the medium term. No one should doubt our determination to meet the target. The inflation target introduced in 1992, and the new regime for monetary policy decision-making introduced in 1997, have shown beyond doubt that monetary policy in the United Kingdom is dedicated to maintaining low and stable inflation. Indeed, for ten years, I was, to my frustration, regularly described as a hawk. But I am neither hawk nor dove. Everyone on the Committee votes according to his or her judgement of the outlook for the economy. I have not changed. The Committee has not changed. Circumstances have changed. When confidence, output and trade around the world collapsed in the autumn of 2008, the balance of threats to the inflation outlook shifted rapidly to the downside. So the Bank of England and central banks in other industrialised countries responded by reducing official interest rates nearly to zero and injecting money directly into the economy. There will come a time when our task will be to manage the exit from such an abnormal degree of monetary stimulus. The MPC will not hesitate to begin to withdraw the current degree of stimulus when we judge that is necessary. When it comes, that is most likely to be through a rise in Bank Rate with asset sales being conducted later in an orderly programme over a period of time, leaving Bank Rate as the active instrument. But monetary policy must be set in the light of the fiscal tightening over the coming years, the continuing fragility in financial markets and the state of the banking system. I know there are those who worry that too rapid a fiscal consolidation will endanger recovery. But the steady reduction in the very large structural deficit over a period of a parliament cannot credibly be postponed indefinitely. If prospects for growth were to weaken, the outlook for inflation would probably be lower and monetary policy could then respond. I do, therefore, Chancellor welcome your commitment to put the UK’s public finances on a sound footing. It is important that, in the medium term, national debt as a proportion of GDP returns to a declining path. At the same time, it is important, however, that we work with our partners overseas to reduce the global imbalances and promote an adequate level of world growth. Countries with large current account and budget deficits will need to pursue both fiscal consolidation and policies to improve their competitiveness. And countries with current account surpluses, while understandably wanting to avoid unsustainable fiscal paths of their own, have a responsibility to expand domestic demand so that the imbalances can be reduced. Only if the two sets of policies work in tandem will growth prove sustainable. Our second priority is to accept the challenge of the new responsibilities that you, Chancellor, have asked the Bank to take on in respect of micro prudential regulation and macro prudential control of the balance sheets of the financial system as a whole. I welcome those new responsibilities. Monetary stability and financial stability are two sides of the same coin. During the crisis the former was threatened by the failure to secure the latter. The experience of the financial crisis taught us two important lessons. The first is that, whatever its theoretical attractions – and there certainly are some – putting prudential regulation into the same organisation as the oversight of consumer protection and market conduct didn’t work in practice. The two types of regulation require different skills and a different approach. Separating them – the so-called “twin peaks” model of financial  regulation – is the right direction of reform. That conclusion is not a reflection on the people who work at FSA. They are an able group and have worked hard to improve prudential regulation over the past three years. I look forward to working with them in the future. Nor does it follow from this first lesson that prudential regulation should necessarily go to the central bank. 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 But a second lesson is that when banks hit trouble the central bank needs to be fully involved in resolving those problems. The Bank of England cannot effectively perform its role as lender of last resort without first-hand knowledge of the health of the banks to which it might provide support. In peacetime, regulation can be conducted outside the central bank. But in a crisis, decisions must be made quickly and decisively and the central bank, working with government which is always responsible for any use of public money, needs to be in charge. That was one of our painful lessons. In approaching our new responsibilities we shall build on the real improvements to its regime of prudential regulation made over the past three years by FSA. But the Bank will bring its own central banking culture. The focus of regulation needs to be on maintaining stability of the banking system as a whole. We shall be looking not just at those aspects of a bank that make it look unsafe in comparison with other institutions, but even more so at whether there are common features that threaten the stability of the system, such as the dangerously high leverage prior to 2007. We shall aim to avoid an overly legalistic culture with its associated compliance-driven style of regulation. That is an important reason for the separation of consumer protection and market conduct from prudential regulation. We will need to exercise discretion when setting capital and liquidity ratios for individual banks. And to do that properly will require changes to the current legislation and rule book. We must reverse the seemingly inexorable trend towards more regulation and more regulators. That did not work in the past and is not the right response now. I am absolutely delighted that Hector Sants has agreed to remain at FSA and then move to the Bank to become the first chief executive of the new prudential regulator. In difficult circumstances, Hector has engineered major improvements to FSA’s prudential regulation. Andrew Bailey will head the Bank’s transition team and will be the first deputy chief executive of the prudential authority. Together, Hector and Andrew form the perfect partnership to make the transition work and create the new organisation. In the new regime, regulation will reflect two different, though complementary, perspectives. The first, as now, is a bottom-up perspective, focused on setting institution-specific capital requirements. Those would be fixed requirements that banks could not breach. The second is an overall perspective with a set of system-wide capital requirements that vary over the economic cycle. Judgements on the level of these capital buffers will be part of the remit of the new Financial Policy Committee. The prudential regulator, with its micro prudential responsibilities, and the Financial Policy Committee, with its macro prudential responsibilities, will need to work closely together, and that is one reason why it is sensible that they are both in the central bank. It is not difficult to see what role such a macro prudential regime might have played in the run-up to the crisis. A progressive tightening of capital standards, for example, would have helped rein in the near-tripling of UK bank balance sheets between 2002 and 2007. The Bank’s sermons on the storms ahead would have had more influence if at the same time a collection plate was passed round the congregation so that money was available in the event that the church roof had to be replaced. But a macro prudential regime also has a key role to play in the downswing phase of the cycle. Since 2008, credit conditions have tightened, jeopardising the recovery and, in turn, threatening renewed losses for banks. By allowing banks to draw on their macro prudential capital buffers, while credit conditions remain tight, the system is counter-cyclical. In other words, a credible macro prudential regime could help forestall both excessive exuberance and unnecessary caution. By altering the pressure on the financial brakes according to circumstances, regulation, far from being an inflexible foe, would become a flexible friend. This type of regulatory regime, and its objectives and tools, are largely untried and untested. But that is not a reason for not trying and not testing. The Financial Policy Committee will be a first. Over the next few years we will put in place a framework for financial stability to 
4 BIS Review 84/2010 parallel that for monetary stability. We need both. As we have seen, one without the other is not enough. Just as the role of a central bank in monetary policy is to take the punch bowl away just as the party gets going, its role in financial stability should be to turn down the music when the dancing gets a little too wild. Still, we should not put all our faith in regulation. It has limits. If the structure of banking creates incentives to take excessive risk then regulators will be overwhelmed by the avarice so vividly captured by Michael Lewis in his book The Big Short. Incentives must be right. One misalignment of incentives today is the implicit guarantee to banks that are “too important to fail”, so that creditors have little incentive to monitor the behaviour of banks because they believe they will be bailed out. This problem is too important to ignore. There is no one simple solution. But we should not shy away from radical reform just because of the opposition of vested interests. So I welcome the setting up of the Banking Commission, with its talented commissioners and a wise and forensic chairman in Sir John Vickers. Let me now return to the quiz question I posed earlier – to what question is 23 the answer? Several plausible answers come to mind. First, 23 is the number of players in England’s World Cup squad in South Africa. Second, it is of course 23 years since England last won the Ashes “down under”. But neither of these are the right answer which is that 23 years is the age difference between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. In case there is any doubt, George is the younger. This age difference is highly desirable because the appropriate incentives are to allocate the responsibility of determining monetary policy to the older generation, which has a real interest in preserving the value of money, and the responsibility for fiscal policy to the younger generation, on whom falls the burden of excessive debt. If we are tempted to leave a large burden of debt for the next generation to pay back, what better incentive mechanism than to have as Chancellor someone who has a longer life expectancy than any previous Chancellor on record? Given those incentives, Chancellor, I look forward to a harmonious coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. Lord Mayor, as we prepare to toast the Bankers and Merchants of the City of London, all of us here tonight would like to pay tribute to your charitable work since you became Lord Mayor. This year the Lord Mayor’s charity “Pitch Perfect” is focussed on two educational charities in which I have a special personal interest – the educational work of the London Symphony Orchestra and Chance to shine, the campaign to regenerate cricket in state schools which, in five years, has already brought the opportunity to play competitive matches to more than one million children, over 40% of whom are girls. Your personal commitment Nick to support these causes in times of great financial difficulty is a tribute to you and also to the charitable instincts of the City of London. We thank you for that work, and I am sure that everyone here tonight thanks both you and the Lady Mayoress for the splendid hospitality which you have extended to us all this evening. So I invite you all to rise and join me in the traditional toast of good health and prosperity to “The Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress”, Nick and Claire Anstee. 
BIS Review 84/2010 1 Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Towards the next phase of growth for Islamic banking and finance – a new paradigm for Asia and the Middle East Opening remarks by HE Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Central Bank of Bahrain, at the 1st Annual World Islamic Banking Conference: Asia Summit 2010, Singapore, 14 June 2010. *      *      * Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:  I should like to thank His Excellency Minister Lim for his kind words of introduction and His Excellency Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore for his kind invitation to participate in this landmark event. The World Islamic Banking Conference has become an established part of the calendar in Bahrain. Last year’s conference was the 16th to be held in the Kingdom. 2009 also saw the WIBC broaden its scope with its first European Summit which was held in London. The present Summit, the first of its kind to be held in Asia, is evidence of the growing geographical scope of Islamic finance which has emerged from being a niche industry to one that has moved into the financial mainstream. The choice of Singapore as the host for the WIBC’s first Asian Summit marks a further step in the globalization of Islamic finance. Singapore’s historical role as a bridge in the trade routes linking Arabia, South Asia and South East Asia make it an appropriate venue for such a Summit. Moreover, with its strong infrastructure and reputation for sound and transparent regulation I am sure Singapore will have an increasingly important role to play in the future development of Islamic finance. The theme of this Session is the Next Phase of Growth for Islamic Banking and Finance. The current phase has certainly been very impressive. From its beginnings a little over 30 years ago, Islamic finance has grown to become an industry – according to some estimates – which amounts to one trillion dollars in assets. Retail banking has been a particularly strong driver of the industry’s growth. Interest in Islamic finance has spread from the Middle East and South East Asia to Europe, Russia, the Central Asian Republics, China, and Africa. Islamic finance is now a genuinely global phenomenon. In Bahrain we have seen a similar pattern of strong growth. Since first licensing Bahrain Islamic Bank in 1978 the sector has grown dramatically. By the year 2000 the assets of the Islamic banks had reached two billion dollars. Last year they stood at 26 billion dollars. The market share of Islamic banks has increased from 1.8 percent of total banking assets to over 11 percent in the same period. The story of the Shari’a compliant insurance and asset management sectors has been a similar one of strong growth. The question that the industry now needs to consider is how to ensure that this strong growth can continue into the future. Although there has been a great upsurge in interest in Islamic finance since the global financial crisis erupted over two years ago, there is no room for complacency in the industry. Both to ensure that it can continue to grow strongly in the future, and that it can avoid the sorts of reputational damage that the conventional industry suffered as a result of the crisis, the Islamic financial industry needs to examine its foundations very carefully. The foundations must be strong enough to ensure that they can support the much larger industry that now rests upon them. Three issues in particular stand out. The first concerns achieving certainty in Islamic financial contracts. Second, the industry’s ability to manage risks needs to be enhanced. Third, the regulatory framework needs to keep pace with the rapid growth of the industry, and also to 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 reflect the lessons learned from the global financial crisis. Let me address each of these in turn. The certainty of Islamic financial contracts has two dimensions. The first, and the best known, is a fact that we are still some way from developing standard documentation which is recognised as Shari’a compliant by scholars from different jurisdictions and from different schools of Islamic jurisprudence. As long as there is a risk that a contract which is recognised as Shari’a compliant by some scholars will not be recognised as such by others, there exists a lack of legal certainty in the industry. It might be argued that this lack of certainty has not inhibited the industry’s growth to-date. Nonetheless it makes it much harder for Islamic financial institutions to operate on a cross-border basis. The result has been that Islamic financial institutions have had a predominantly domestic focus and have not been able to achieve the scale economies that might make them viable competitors to conventional institutions which do enjoy these benefits. The lack of economies of scale also increases the costs of Islamic financial products and thus ultimately the cost to the consumer. The International Islamic Financial Market (IIFFM), which is based in Bahrain, has been at the forefront of attempts to develop standardised Islamic financial contracts. Working closely with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the IIFM has recently drafted a Tahawwut master agreement which provides standardised documentation for Islamic derivatives. The master agreement was endorsed by the IIFM Board of Shari’a Scholars which includes some of the industry’s most prominent and widely respected scholars. While the IIFM documentation brings a more rigorous and robust architecture to the development of Islamic derivatives, it should be seen as merely the beginning of the process. Much more work will be required to ensure that standardised contracts for other Islamic financial products can be developed which have the support of the great majority of Shari’a scholars. Within the past 12 months, a new dimension to the legal uncertainty of Islamic financial contracts has arisen. Since the global financial crisis began, we have seen the first defaults on Sukuk. These defaults have raised a number of difficult legal questions which are currently before the courts. In particular, they raise questions about the rights of the Sukuk holders in the event of a default by the issuer and in particular whether they have a claim on the underlying asset. It is important that these cases are resolved rapidly and that they create clear precedents and mechanisms for handling defaults in future as otherwise the lack of legal certainty will act as a drag on the development of the Sukuk market. The second set of issues relate to risk management. This has a number of different dimensions, but two in particular are worth highlighting. The first relates to liquidity risk. The conventional financial industry received a wake-up call during the crisis concerning the importance of understanding, monitoring and controlling liquidity risks. The Islamic financial industry must recognise that it too needs good liquidity risk management. How Islamic financial institutions can manage their liquidity risk given the relative absence of short-term money market instruments has been a problem for the industry for some time. However, the events of recent years should give a greater sense of urgency to resolving these problems and we need to redouble our efforts to find a solution. A second area of risk management to which Islamic institutions need to give some attention is the problem of limiting the concentration of risk in particular economic sectors or asset types. The industry’s preference for a real asset to back financial transactions has, unfortunately, resulted in a relatively high concentration of risk in real estate. As a result, many Islamic financial institutions have asset portfolios which are concentrated on this potentially very volatile sector. The performance of real estate markets in North America, Europe, and in certain parts of the Middle East in recent years have highlighted the risks of excessive concentrations of lending to this sector. It is important that in future the Islamic 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 financial industry should find ways of diversifying its risks and of reducing its reliance on real estate backed assets. Finally, on the subject of regulation, it is important that we fully incorporate the lessons of the global financial crisis into regulatory frameworks that apply to Islamic financial institutions. Although some people in the industry believe that it escaped relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis, and therefore has nothing to learn from the recent experience of the conventional industry, I do not share this point of view. Although the Islamic financial industry was relatively insulated from the first round effects of the crisis because it did not invest in “toxic” structured financial products, it has not been able to avoid the second round effects. These have included sharply reduced liquidity in all markets, and the effect of the global economic downturn on the credit-worthiness of all borrowers, including those who are customers of Islamic financial institutions. The principles of sound finance – do not concentrate risk, do not rely on collateral with unrealistic  valuations – apply equally to Islamic institutions as to conventional ones. The current prudential framework that applies to Islamic financial institutions is based closely on that developed for conventional ones. Although adjustments have been made to reflect the special nature of Islamic financial institutions, the basic framework is similar to that of the Basel II Capital Adequacy Standards and other prudential rules that the Basel Committee has developed over the years. In consequence, as the international standard setting bodies develop new prudential standards that reflect the lessons of the crisis we need to be ready to revise the prudential framework for Islamic financial institutions accordingly. We will need to adapt the new capital adequacy and liquidity standards for conventional institutions to reflect the specific circumstances of the Islamic financial industry. In conclusion, it should be clear that there is a great deal of work to be done to ensure that the foundations of the Islamic financial industry are sufficiently strong to support the very much bigger structure that now stands upon them. Even so, I strongly believe that if we can ensure that the foundations are sufficiently robust, the Islamic financial industry has a great and profitable future ahead of it. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 84/2010 1 José Manuel González-Páramo: Re-starting securitisation Keynote speech by Mr José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe/European Science Foundation (ESF) and Information Management Network Global ABS (Asset-Backed Securities) 2010 Conference, London, 16 June 2010. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  I. Introduction I am very pleased to be here in London to participate again at the AFME/ESF and IMN Global ABS Conference. Today, I would like to share with you some thoughts on the restarting of the ABS markets, in the light of the important role that it should play from a macro-financial point of view.  More precisely, I shall first outline the role which securitisation should play in the financial system and why this role is important. Then, I shall assess in more detail the current situation of the securitisation markets. Finally, I would like to make some considerations on the way forward for the restarting of the ABS markets. In doing so, I shall assess what has been done and what still needs to be done to reach a sustained rebound of the securitisation markets.  II. Current financial market conditions To set the stage, I shall refer to the ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, published on 4 June, which analyses in detail the so-called large and complex banking groups (LCBGs), and the findings of which may, with some caution, be extended to the euro area banking sector as a whole.  Thus, we noted in our latest Financial Stability Review that many LCBGs from the euro area have returned to a modest profitability in the course of 2009, and that their financial performance has strengthened further in the first quarter of 2010. At the same time, de-leveraging has continued, while banks have further reduced their reliance on wholesale funding in favour of an increased share of more stable funding sources, such as retail customer deposits and equity.  Notwithstanding this slightly positive note, over the next few years the euro area banking sector will face large funding needs, as most of you are aware of. In particular, the 20 largest euro area banking groups have about EUR 800 billion of long-term debt outstanding that will need to be refinanced between May 2010 and end-2012. This figure represents almost half of their outstanding debt with a maturity of over one year.  In addition, the need for banks to issue medium to long-term debt is likely to increase as a result of new regulatory requirements on stable funding ratios that would come into force at the end of 2012.  Against this background, securitisation can potentially play a vital role, and thereby strongly support the financing of the economy, in two main respects:   First, in order to mitigate the potential funding challenges that I have just mentioned, securitisation may contribute to the broadening of the funding base – both inter-temporally and geographically –, by transforming illiquid assets into negotiable long-term securities (even if these may not necessarily be very liquid). It may thus help to unblock credit supply constraints in an environment of continued de-leveraging by 
2 BIS Review 84/2010 taking regionally or sectorally concentrated credit risk off bank balance sheet and distributing it to a wider investor base.   Second, a proper use of financial engineering techniques, such as securitisation, may provide a better match between the preferences of borrowers and investors in terms of cash flow structure, type of interest rate, degree of risk and currency denomination. This is particularly relevant when the securitisation pool is composed of loans to borrowers who cannot have access to the capital markets on their own, i.e. households and Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). In other words, securitisation may function as a bridge between these types of borrowers and those investors who cannot easily access these types of exposures otherwise.  To summarise, if the ABS markets work satisfactorily, they may contribute to the completeness of the financial system by distributing the risks and returns associated with a large range of non-marketable financial assets to a more diversified set of holders, with at least an equal or better capacity to bear these risks. This can contribute to enhancing the efficiency of the economic system. This is why I believe that a rebound of the securitisation market on a sounder footing, including a stable issuance activity of marketable assets remains crucial from a macro-financial point of view.  III. What is the current state of the securitisation markets?  Of course, the state of the securitisation markets is connected with the general situation of financial markets, and we all know that the current financial environment remains challenging. Financial markets had experienced some sort of improvement in 2009 and the early part of 2010. However, in early May adverse market dynamics took hold again across a broad range of financial markets, including several debt securities markets in the euro area, in an environment of diminishing market liquidity. As a result, most funding markets deteriorated rapidly.  As you know, to help restore a normal market functioning again, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to take additional non-standard measures on 9 May 2010, including the conduct of purchases of euro area public and private debt securities in secondary markets, the reactivation of fixed-rate full-allotment long-term refinancing operations (LTROs), and the resumption of US dollar liquidity-providing operations.  Nevertheless, even abstracting from the impact of the adverse developments in the financial markets, the securitisation markets themselves have not satisfactorily developed in the last years, both in terms of broadening the investors’ base and of achieving stable issuance volumes. In both 2008 and 2009, the share of new issuances distributed in the market accounted for 1 or 2 percent of all new issuance. This is of course in sharp contrast with the percentages observed in the years preceding the crisis. For instance, in late 2006 and the first half of 2007 1 or 2 percent was the share of retained (as opposed to distributed) issuance.  Since securitisation techniques were nevertheless still used substantially in 2007 and 2008 despite the lack of market participants being able or willing to absorb the newly-issued securities, most of this paper ended up being used as collateral with central banks. In the case of the euro area, this process started off indeed already in 2007 and increased more significantly in 2008 when ABS constituted 28 percent of all assets being used as collateral with the Eurosystem. This share decreased moderately to 23 percent in 2009. These developments reflect an important switch in the business model of securitisation, from the “originate-to-distribute” model up to the summer of 2007 to some form of “originate-to-repo” model. To make things worse, the “originate-to-repo” transactions that took off when the turmoil started in July 2007 have often little in common with the “originate-to-distribute” assets that 
BIS Review 84/2010 3 were marketed before mid-2007. Thus, the “originate-to-repo” securities do not aim at being attractive to investors, but serve a different purpose, namely to generate collateral buffers with the central bank. So, the significantly large volumes of retained issuance are effective indicators of the scale of the continuing dislocation of the ABS market and the vanishing of private markets.  However, it should be obvious to everyone that the issuance of ABS only to serve as collateral with central banks cannot be a sustainable strategy for the ABS market. In normal times central bank operations are intrinsically of a short-term nature and of a limited size, and are designed to implement the stance of monetary policy. By contrast, ABS transactions backed by residential and commercial property loans have much longer maturities and must cover a very sizeable market. In other words, in normal times central banks tend to have a very limited involvement in financial intermediation and only private investors have the capacity and the need to offer long-term funding to originators.  What are the more recent trends? Some developments in the last few months may be interpreted as showing tentative signs of a recovery as new ABS issues were distributed and placed with private investors . Moreover, the volume of placed assets during the first five months of 2010 outpaced the combined placed volumes in 2008 and 2009.  These tentative positive signals are confirmed by the European ABS Investor Confidence Index by JP Morgan, which has remained in positive territory for the last nine months. Our own Bank Lending Survey indicates that for the first quarter of 2010, banks generally reported that their access to wholesale funding became easier.1 In addition, after a broadly neutral evaluation of true-sale securitisation access for corporate and housing loans in the fourth quarter of 2009, banks assessed the situation as significantly more positive, in particular for the securitisation of housing loans. It should be noted, however, that this survey was conducted before the outbreak of the sovereign debt crisis.  While all these indications may suggest that demand for ABSs is re-emerging, we still need confirmation from the data over the next months. Moreover, the latter developments represent an improvement but are still far from normal market conditions, or even from suggesting that we may be moving towards such conditions. IV. How do we bring back investors’ confidence?  Taking the stock of the latest information, one should recognise that euro area securitisation markets remain dysfunctional, mainly for demand-side related reasons. And, of course, the malfunctioning of the market has implications also for the supply-side.   On the demand side, the investor base has been and remains severely eroded and many earlier active investors, such as SIVs and money market funds, are not expected to return to the market anytime soon. Europe in particular suffers from a lack of a significant real-money investor base that could step in.   On the supply side, concomitantly, the profit generating potential of securitisation remains insufficient, since spreads for various ABS still exceed the break-even levels from the issuer’s perspective. At the current levels of spreads, securitisation does not make economic sense for originators in most cases. At the same time, it would appear that current yields, with some exceptions, are not attractive to compensate for the perceived risks in the view of many investors.  Therefore, although there are some signs of improvement, the current situation in structured finance continues to impose market funding constraints on banks and to hamper banks in                                                  1  See “The Euro Area Bank Lending Survey”, April 2010, ECB. 
4 BIS Review 84/2010 providing credit to the economy. In this sense, securitisation is still certainly unable to fulfil the objectives that I highlighted at the beginning of my speech. Going forward, the key question is therefore: how do we bring back investors to the securitisation markets? This is tantamount to asking: how can investor confidence in securitisation be restored?  I believe that the development of transparent, comparable and simple securitisation structures, based on high quality standards of underlying assets, and with at least some market segments characterised by high liquidity, is a sine qua non condition for a return to self-sustaining securitisation markets.  Indeed, investors need to be able to exercise the required due diligence and to assess the assets that are on offer, with the support of the credit rating agencies, which in turn should have the information and the analytical capacities required for this purpose. This, in turn, calls for a careful definition of the information that should be shared among market participants.  The issue of liquidity is even more complex because of the cumulative nature of the conditions underpinning it. Enhanced secondary market liquidity will make the entrance of new investors more likely. A more liquid market may come as a result of better price disclosure, standardisation and less complex structures. However, without institutional investors, liquidity will not reappear. There is some circularity problem here since at the same time, it is more likely that institutional investors return to the market when market liquidity is proven to be there or strongly expected to be back. Finally, less sophisticated and specialised investors may also enter the market, but this would require an even more material increase in the simplicity, standardisation and transparency of securitisation markets. V. The Eurosystem’s contribution to restoring the ABS markets Let me dwell on the requirement of enhanced transparency of the underlying asset pools. I would like to elaborate on the Eurosystem’s contribution to enhanced disclosure through its initiative to make loan-by-loan level data on ABS transactions widely available. Let me say from the start that this initiative alone will not suffice to re-open the market, but it would become an important building block along the path towards standardisation, simpler structures, and better post trade price transparency. As you will remember, in December 2009 the ECB launched a public consultation in order to gather market and public feedback on a proposal to introduce requirements on loan level data in ABS transactions and make this an explicit eligibility criterion, should the ABS be used as collateral with the Eurosystem.  This initiative may trigger a structural change in the way the different market participants interact within the securitisation markets. By increasing the transparency, availability and quality of the information on the underlying assets, and by ensuring a regular updating of the information, market participants will have a sounder base on which to build valuation, risk and surveillance models.  The public consultation included six questions on the general advisability of the initiative as well as on technical details of the implementation. At the end of the consultation period on 26 February 2010, 53 responses from different investors, market data vendors, credit rating agencies, financial service providers, audit firms, stock exchanges, law firms, public authorities, and central securities depositaries, had been received. The responses revealed a strong support from market participants, mainly because of its potential contribution to increasing transparency, which is seen as an essential ingredient for more informed risk assessments and to restore weakened confidence in ABS markets. In addition, respondents 
BIS Review 84/2010 5 issued a number of recommendations to the Eurosystem regarding specific implementation aspects that should contribute to a smoother introduction of the loan by loan level data. From a timing perspective, the Governing Council of the ECB will assess during the autumn the results of the final technical preparatory phase that has already started, also taking into account the recommendations put forward during the public consultation, before deciding whether to proceed with the final phase of the introduction of ABS loan by loan data requirements. This decision is envisaged to take place during the fall 2010. In case it is decided to proceed, a twelve-month phasing-in period – in line with the feedback received in the public consultation – would be sufficient for originators and issuers to adapt their systems to provide the required data.  It should be noted that the Eurosystem’s initiative on loan level data is in line with certain amendments introduced by the Second Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD II”) that will enter into effect on 1 January 2011. Amongst other things, CRD II provides that the sponsor or the originator must ensure that investors and prospective investors have readily available access to all materially relevant data on credit quality and performance of the individual underlying exposures. Thus, CRD II views information on individual underlying exposures (i.e. loan-level data) as necessary for investors to be able to make reasoned investment decisions. However, I want also to make clear that, along with policy initiatives, the structured finance industry has an essential role in restarting the European securitization markets and setting them on a sounder footing. The industry cannot realistically expect that the return of investors’ confidence will be just a question of time and implementing regulatory action. Likewise, certainly confidence will not be restored by introducing minor changes to the instruments and the functioning of the markets. On the contrary, confidence in securitization will return among private as well as public stakeholders only if market participants and their associations are able to materially enhance market standards and practices.  Let me stress also that the industry cannot expect public authorities to accept merely cosmetic changes to the instruments and the markets. This, for example, applies to the Eurosystem’s collateral framework. In a context in which outstanding ABS represent almost 25% of the total collateral deposited by counterparties with the Eurosystem, it is imperative for the Eurosystem to be prepared to perform a proper assessment of risks whenever needed. In this context, loan-level information will enable ratings agencies to produce meaningful surveillance reports, which could in turn help the Eurosystem to diligently assess the risks implied by the collateral accepted in our refinancing operations. Industry-led initiatives aimed at revitalising the European securitisation market are inspired by high level principles, which typically meet immediate consensus. However, when these principles are transposed into specific provisions in some market convention, consensus becomes less easy to reach. In fact, aligning all the stakeholders’ incentives often proves to be difficult and there is the risk of only reaching a very low minimum common denominator. Certainly, this would not be sufficient to win back the confidence of public and private players in securitization. I therefore invite the industry to continue and to strengthen its efforts in this vital area of work. VI. Concluding remarks  Let me conclude by saying that, if managed in good order, securitisation should be a welfare-improving tool, because value is created by secured funding that is correctly structured and allows to adequately distribute financing and funding, and the related risks among households, enterprises, banks and investors. When it works properly, securitisation may represent a significant step towards more complete credit markets, thereby contributing to enhancing the efficiency of the economic system. The revival of securitisation markets is 
6 BIS Review 84/2010 needed in many countries to support the provision of credit to the real economy, particularly to households and small business.  While it is essential to define new market standards in terms of simplicity and transparency, more actions may be needed to re-start the securitisation market. There does not seem to be one single and simple solution that can unlock the securitisation market. This is natural since structured finance is a combination of manifold features such as different asset types, a variety of interest rate products with diverse maturity profiles and structures, and a variety of legal regimes and market arrangements. Thus, restoring the securitisation markets requires a combination of initiatives, both from the private and the public sector.  The Eurosystem is contributing, first of all, by accepting structured finance assets as collateral. This proved and still proves a great support to this market segment during the crisis, as it helped and continues to help to avoid a sudden and disruptive unavailability of funding to originators of ABS. Second, as mentioned earlier, by introducing a loan level data requirement to our set of eligibility criteria, we may contribute to increasing the disclosure standards for the market at large. However, more needs to be done, as many of those required steps, for example enhancing secondary market liquidity, go beyond the scope for direct action by the Eurosystem.  Looking ahead, a self-sustained revival of the ABS market requires fundamental changes. It is high time to raise to the challenges of transparency, standardisation and product simplicity. This is where the industry has to step up its efforts in order to help decisively in restoring confidence in the securitisation markets. Thank you for your attention. 
Mark Carney: Fortune favours the bold Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Greater Charlottetown Area Chamber of Commerce, Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, 16 June 2010. The original speech, which contains various links to the documents mentioned, can be found on the US Federal Reserve System’s website.  *      *      * It is a pleasure to be here. In this birthplace of Confederation, courageous decisions were made here to found our great nation. Similar boldness, both in Canada and globally, is again required. To explain why, I would like to touch upon the recent past, the present outlook, and our challenging future. The recent past: the recession in context From the end of 2008 to the middle of last year, Canada experienced a short, sharp recession. With the exception of government spending, all major components of aggregate demand declined, and industrial production dropped 15 per cent. Canadian exporters suffered particularly, owing to the sharp fall in the components of U.S. economic activity that matter most for Canada. For example, U.S. demand for motor vehicles fell by more than half and housing starts by two-thirds. Partly as a result, several major Canadian industries are now undergoing deep restructurings. The recession had a considerable impact on employment. Some 400,000 Canadians lost their jobs, and our unemployment rate spiked by almost 3 percentage points to its highest level in more than a decade. Although the labour market is clearly improving, with three-quarters of the jobs lost now recovered, too many Canadians who want to work are still out of a job, and many of those still employed are working fewer hours than they would like (see Appendix Chart 1). As painful as our recession was, Canada suffered less than most other advanced economies. Consumption, housing, and employment in Canada all held up substantially better than in the United States. The cumulative fall in Canadian real GDP of 3.3 per cent compares with declines of 3.6 in the United States, about 5 per cent in the euro area, and more than 8 per cent in Japan. Canada’s better performance can be explained by two factors. First, with a highly credible monetary policy and the strongest fiscal position in the G-7, Canadian policy-makers were able to respond swiftly and effectively with extraordinarily accommodative measures. The Bank of Canada began cutting interest rates in December 2007 and pursued an aggressive series of reductions until our policy rate reached one-quarter of one per cent in April of last year, the lowest it can effectively go. The Bank then provided exceptional guidance on the likely path of interest rates necessary to achieve the inflation target in order to maximize the monetary stimulus from its actions. Second, Canada entered the recession with notable advantages, including a well-functioning financial system, strong corporate balance sheets, and relatively healthy household finances. We will have to draw on these advantages during the recovery. While the global downturn was synchronous, economic performance across markets and sectors is likely to be increasingly uneven. For some Canadian businesses, the recovery may prove as challenging as the downturn. Do not be misled. This was the Great Recession. To claim otherwise with simplistic comparisons to prior downturns is to ignore both the rapidity and the scale of the policy BIS Review 83/2010 1 
response, as well as the likelihood that the aftershocks from the crisis will persist for years.1 In particular, the Bank expects that:  the pace, composition, and variability of global growth will be substantially different across economies;   the level and volatility of commodity prices will be higher;   the nature of the global financial system will be radically altered; and   the openness of global markets for goods and capital can no longer be assured. Canada is not a bystander in this global upheaval. We can influence policies and focus reforms. Our businesses can anticipate and take advantage of emerging trends. But the efforts required of all of us will be heroic, and hesitation will be costly. For both policy-makers and businesses at this juncture, Virgil’s adage applies: fortune favours the bold. The present The current economic outlook is neither as robust as recent data indicate nor as dire as current headlines scream. The global economic recovery is proceeding, but it is increasingly uneven across countries. There is strong momentum in emerging-market economies; some consolidation of the recoveries in the United States, Japan, and other industrialized economies; and the possibility of renewed weakness in Europe. Global growth is now projected to average slightly above 4 per cent a year through 2012. Few, apart from the Bank of Canada, thought that possible at this time last year. The Bank continues to hold the view that, led by domestic demand, Canadian growth will likely be the strongest among the G-7 nations over the next two years. Recent activity in Canada is unfolding largely as expected. The economy grew by a robust 6.1 per cent in the first quarter, led by housing and consumer spending. Employment growth has resumed. Household spending is expected to decelerate to a pace more consistent with income growth. The anticipated pickup in business investment will be important for a more balanced recovery. This outlook is subject to considerable uncertainties. In most advanced economies, the recovery remains heavily dependent on monetary and fiscal stimulus. The required rebalancing of global growth has not yet materialized. In general, broad forces of household, bank, and sovereign deleveraging have barely begun and will add to the variability, and temper the pace, of global growth as they proceed. Recent tensions in Europe are likely to result in higher borrowing costs and more rapid tightening of fiscal policy in advanced economies. As I will discuss shortly, without countervailing policies, this could lead to a more protracted recovery. Nothing is easy The reality of a policy-led, multi-speed recovery is that the global economy is now bumping up against three limits.                                                  1  P. Cross, “Year-end review of 2009.” Canadian Economic Observer, Statistics Canada Catalogue No. 11-010-X, 23, No. 4, April 2010. 2 BIS Review 83/2010 
The first is the supply response in commodities. With emerging-market economies’ share of global growth now two-thirds, rather than the one-half it was at the start of the millennium, global growth is more commodity-intensive. In our April forecast, the Bank projected an additional 30 per cent increase in the prices of non-energy commodities over the next few years. The second limit relates to the challenges of derivative monetary policy. Owing to managed exchange rates, many emerging-market economies are acting as if U.S. monetary policy were appropriate to their circumstances. Despite strong capital inflows, these countries are resorting to a series of measures of unproven effectiveness to address overheating pressures. Capital controls, restrictions on loan-to-value ratios on mortgages, and higher reserve requirements are all stop-gap measures in the face of broader forces. While these measures will have some impact, ultimately, there are only two possibilities in emerging-market economies: either higher interest rates or higher inflation. The third limit is fiscal stimulus. Reflecting the massive fiscal response and the recession, the International Monetary Fund projects that advanced economy debt will rise from about 80 per cent of GDP in 2008 to 110 per cent by 2015. Major efforts will be required to stabilize the situation. The canary in the coal mine, Greece, faces one of the largest primary adjustments ever undertaken. Moreover, as with other European countries, Greece cannot expect to benefit from lower interest rates, depreciation, or export growth to facilitate adjustment. It will require significant wage reductions and productivity enhancements to restore competitiveness and growth. The possible responses of other countries to the situation are denial or conviction. In the former case, growing public debt will push up global interest rates, crowding out private investment and lowering potential growth.2 Given the scale of the fiscal challenge, it is perhaps not surprising that some eminent economists are looking for an “easier” way out. This form of denial is to allow temporarily higher inflation in order to inflate away public debt. To the Bank, this is a siren call. Those most in need of fiscal consolidation are often those with debt portfolios of the shortest duration. The “surprise” would have to be very sudden and very large to have a material impact. Of course, if temporary inflation becomes built into expectations, real rates may well increase, rather than fall, thereby exacerbating debt dynamics. Moreover, in the past, it has proven devilishly hard to keep inflation high temporarily. Would it be credible to have a one-off increase in the inflation target? Central banks have worked for decades to get inflation down to levels consistent with price stability. We should not risk these hard-won gains. The second, more positive, and more likely, response to the fiscal challenge is conviction. We have seen that conviction in recent weeks. The European financial stabilization plan, announced in May, is a bold step towards accelerated fiscal consolidation. The plan has been followed by a series of concrete actions. Spain announced measures totalling 1.5 per cent of GDP in additional fiscal consolidation, while Portugal introduced consolidation measures amounting to 1 per cent of GDP for 2010. Greece has passed the key elements of                                                  2  In a simulation that assumes that advanced countries do not make any fiscal adjustments to stabilize their debt dynamics, the Bank found an increase of 175 to 300 basis points in advanced-economy yields, given the scale of the debt burden. See K. Beaton, C. de Resende, R. Lalonde, and S. Snudden, “Prospects for Global Current Account Rebalancing,” Bank of Canada Discussion Paper No. 2010-4.

its austerity package, and the United Kingdom is planning for an early and tough budget. Similar measures are likely in other countries in the coming weeks. However, the coming “Age of Austerity” carries its own risks. Fiscal policy that is tighter, sooner for all could create deficient demand in the global economy. The Bank of Canada estimates that, in the absence of real exchange rate adjustment and higher domestic demand elsewhere, the shortfall in global GDP could reach $7 trillion by 2015.3 To recoup this enormous sum, both the public and private sectors must be bold. Public boldness: the G-20 agenda At the Pittsburgh summit last September, the G-20 claimed that “It worked.” Well, it isn’t over. The G-20’s agenda is comprehensive and radical, but we need to implement, as well as propose. As a consequence, Canada’s priorities for the upcoming G-20 Leaders Summit are:  To make concrete the G-20 framework for “strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.” This stresses the shared responsibility of countries to make up that $7 trillion shortfall I just highlighted.   This will require changes in behaviour and policy adjustments on several fronts, including: – sustained and credible fiscal consolidation in the advanced countries; – structural and financial reforms that will increase domestic demand in major emerging-market economies; – increased real exchange rate flexibility in emerging-market economies to facilitate the adjustment from external demand to domestic demand; and – structural reforms to enhance productivity and potential growth in advanced economies.  To move forward on the core G-20 financial reform agenda. There are two main approaches to reform: to protect the banks from the cycle and to protect the cycle from the banks. Both are necessary. – Protecting the banks from the economic cycle means making each bank, individually, more resilient. This will require more capital, higher liquidity, and better risk management, complemented by stronger supervision. While there is still much to be done, in general, these types of measures will make global financial institutions look more like their Canadian peers. – Protecting the cycle from the banks means making the system as a whole more resilient. This requires building a system that can withstand the failure of any single financial institution. These measures (including contingent capital, better infrastructure for key markets, and new resolution authorities) are new and will change how our financial system operates.4                                                  3  See M. Carney, “The Virtue of Productivity in a Wicked World,” Speech delivered to the Ottawa Economics Association, 24 March 2010, available at: <http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2010/sp240310.html>, and Beaton, de Resende, Lalonde, and Snudden (2010). 4  See M. Carney, “The G-20’s Core Agenda to Reduce Systemic Risk,” Speech delivered to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), 10 June 2010, available at: <http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2010/sp100610.html>. 4 BIS Review 83/2010 
 Finally, to ensure that business can operate, as much as possible, in an open and stable trade and regulatory environment. We must live up to the G-20 commitment to resist trade and financial protectionism. Private boldness: thriving in a multi-polar economy And what of private boldness? With so much uncertainty, isn’t now the time for corporate caution? Waiting on the sidelines ignores both the scale of the challenge and the opportunities presented by both our historic underperformance and the transformation of the global economy. We should recognise that Canada is not as productive as it could be. Our productivity ranking has dropped from third of the 20 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1960 to 15th of the current 30 members.5 After some promising signs in the late 1990s, average labour productivity growth has since slowed dramatically. A small part of this could be due to measurement errors (which will be corrected over time) and a bit more reflects lags associated with the economy’s adjustment process, but most of this yawning gap between us and our peers reflects fundamental shortcomings. Addressing these will require more concerted efforts on the part of business and government since:  Canada underinvests in machinery and equipment (M&E), training, and innovation – in fact, all of the underlying drivers of productivity.   Canadian workers have about half the amount of information and communications technology of their American counterparts.   Canada is 16th among the member countries of the OECD in the intensity of business research and development.   Even when we do invest, we are mediocre. Our poor multifactor productivity growth indicates that Canadian firms do not effectively use the capital that they purchase. In general, while there is more to do, governments have put in place many of the conditions for a productivity revival. Our tax competitiveness has improved dramatically. Comparatively, Canada invests the largest proportion of GDP in primary research. Tariffs on machinery-and-equipment investment are being eliminated, and we have sound macro policies and generally effective regulation. Governments will need to maintain the reform momentum, but they cannot be expected to will individuals and companies to take risks. Business will need to step up. Productivity growth fell in the latest recession, the first time this has happened in three decades. Despite the availability of capital, relatively strong balance sheets, and improving economic conditions, business investment has been subdued compared with past downturns and the scale of the challenge (see Chart 2). Investment intentions for 2010 remain modest and largely driven by the public sector. This needs to change for a balanced recovery and a more competitive economy. This is not just a challenge for our largest corporations. Our small- and medium-sized enterprises are, in many respects, the engines of our economy. The rapidly changing global economy will mean that more, too, will be asked of them.                                                  5  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Compendium of Productivity Indicators, 2006 and 2008.

The imperatives for Canadian businesses appear clear. New suppliers need to be sourced; new markets opened; a new approach to managing for a more volatile environment developed. The relatively slow recovery expected in our most important trading partner, along with ongoing sectoral adjustments, means that Canadian firms have to find new markets. The global economy is increasingly multi-polar. Emerging-market economies currently account for about two-thirds of global growth. They represent almost one-half of the growth in imports over the past decade, particularly of capital goods. They are the main drivers of commodity prices and are therefore important determinants of our terms of trade. More fundamentally, they are increasingly thought to be leaders and innovators in public policy and business.6 Canada needs to become fully engaged with these emerging centres of economic power. Monetary policy going forward In the wake of the shock of the global financial crisis, the Bank of Canada was aggressive. We engaged in a series of innovative, coordinated actions with G-10 central banks; we slashed interest rates to their lowest possible levels; and we then provided unprecedented transparency on their likely future path through our conditional commitment. All of these actions were necessary for the Bank to fulfill its mandate to achieve its inflation target of 2 per cent CPI inflation. A more subtle approach is now warranted. The Bank must balance the competing influences on Canadian activity and inflation of momentum in domestic demand and the increasingly uneven global recovery. In recent months, as the need for emergency settings of monetary policy was passing, the Bank gradually reduced the degree of monetary stimulus. In April, we ended our conditional commitment, which in itself represented a tightening of monetary conditions.7 At the start of this month, the Bank raised its target overnight rate to 50 basis points and re-established the normal functioning of the overnight market. These decisions leave considerable monetary stimulus still in place, consistent with the large degree of excess supply in Canada, the strength of Canadian spending, and the uneven global recovery. Given the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the outlook, any further reduction of monetary stimulus would have to be weighed carefully against domestic and global developments. In light of the scale and volatility of these conflicting forces, it should be evident that no particular path for monetary policy is preordained. Conclusion In conclusion, now is not the time to rest on our laurels. Public and private boldness, both at home and abroad, will be required to secure the recovery. This means G-20 action to reform the global financial system and to secure a sustainable recovery. This means investments by our businesses to improve productivity and to gain new markets. This means Canadians should fully engage the new multi-polar global economy.                                                  6  R. B. Zoellick, President The World Bank Group, “The End of the Third World?

These are all big decisions. How quickly and how effectively they are taken will influence activity and inflation in Canada and, therefore, the stance of monetary policy. The Bank will need to be agile. The Bank will maintain its unwavering commitment to price stability. The single, most direct contribution that monetary policy can make to sound economic performance is to provide Canadians with confidence that their money will retain its purchasing power. Price stability lowers uncertainty, minimizes the costs of inflation, reduces the cost of capital, and creates an environment in which households and firms can invest and plan for the future.

Ben S Bernanke: Regulatory reform implementation Testimony by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, US Senate, Washington DC, 30 September 2010. *      *      * Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and other members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about the Federal Reserve’s implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act).  In the years leading up to the recent financial crisis, the global regulatory framework did not effectively keep pace with the profound changes in the financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act addresses critical gaps and weaknesses of the U.S. regulatory framework, many of which were revealed by the crisis. The Federal Reserve is committed to working with the other financial regulatory agencies to effectively implement and execute the act, while also developing complementary improvements to the financial regulatory framework.  The act gives the Federal Reserve several crucial new responsibilities. These responsibilities include being part of the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, supervision of nonbank financial firms that are designated as systemically important by the council, supervision of thrift holding companies, and the development of enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms designated by the council (including capital, liquidity, stress test, and living will requirements). In addition, the Federal Reserve has or shares important rulemaking authority for implementing the so-called Volcker Rule restrictions on proprietary trading and private fund activities of banking firms, credit risk retention requirements for securitizations, and restrictions on interchange fees for debit cards, among other provisions.  All told, the act requires the Federal Reserve to complete more than 50 rulemakings and sets of formal guidelines, as well as a number of studies and reports, many within a relatively short period. We have also been assigned formal responsibilities to consult and collaborate with other agencies on a substantial number of additional rules, provisions, and studies. Overall, we have identified approximately 250 projects associated with implementing the act. To ensure that we meet our obligations in a timely manner, we are drawing on expertise and resources from across the Federal Reserve System in areas such as banking supervision, economic research, financial markets, consumer protection, payments, and legal analysis. We have created a senior staff position to coordinate our efforts and have developed project-reporting and tracking tools to facilitate management and oversight of all of our implementation responsibilities. The Federal Reserve is committed to its long-standing practice of ensuring that all its rulemakings be conducted in a fair, open, and transparent manner. Accordingly, we are disclosing on our public website summaries of all communications with members of the public – including banks, trade associations, consumer groups, and academics – regarding matters subject to a proposed or potential future rulemaking under the act.  In addition to our own rulemakings and studies, we have been providing technical and policy advice to the Treasury Department as it works to establish the oversight council and the related Office of Financial Research. We are working with the Treasury to develop the council’s organizational documents and structure. We are also assisting the council with the construction of its framework for identifying systemically important nonbank financial firms and financial market utilities, as well as with its required studies on the proprietary trading and private fund activities of banking firms and on financial-sector concentration limits.  Additionally, work is well under way to transfer the Federal Reserve’s consumer protection responsibilities specified in the act to the new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. A BIS Review 124/2010 1 
transition team at the Board, headed by Governor Duke, is working closely with Treasury staff responsible for setting up the new agency. We have established the operating accounts and initial funding for the bureau, and we have provided the Treasury detailed information about our programs and staffing in the areas of rulemaking, compliance examinations, policy analysis, complaint handling, and consumer education. We are also providing advice and information about supporting infrastructure that the Bureau will need to carry out its responsibilities, such as human resource systems and information technology. Well before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve was working with other regulatory agencies here and abroad to design and implement a stronger set of prudential requirements for internationally active banking firms. The governing body for the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reached an agreement a few weeks ago on the major elements of a new financial regulatory architecture, commonly known as Basel III. By increasing the quantity and quality of capital that banking firms must hold and by strengthening liquidity requirements, Basel III aims to constrain bank risk-taking, reduce the incidence and severity of future financial crises, and produce a more resilient financial system. The key elements of this framework are due to be finalized by the end of this year.  In concordance with the letter and the spirit of the act, the Federal Reserve is also continuing its work to strengthen its supervision of the largest, most complex financial firms and to incorporate macroprudential considerations into supervision. As the act recognizes, the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory agencies must supervise financial institutions and critical infrastructures with an eye toward not only the safety and soundness of each individual firm, but also overall financial stability. Indeed, the crisis demonstrated that a too narrow focus on the safety and soundness of individual firms can result in a failure to detect and thwart emerging threats to financial stability that cut across many firms.  A critical feature of a successful systemic or macroprudential approach to supervision is a multidisciplinary perspective. Our experience in 2009 with the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (popularly known as the bank stress tests) demonstrated the feasibility and benefits of employing such a perspective.1 The stress tests also showed how much the supervision of systemically important institutions can benefit from simultaneous horizontal evaluations of the practices and portfolios of a number of individual firms and from employment of robust quantitative assessment tools. Building on that experience, we have reoriented our supervision of the largest, most complex banking firms to include a quantitative surveillance mechanism and to make greater use of the broad range of skills of the Federal Reserve staff.  A final element of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to implement the Dodd-Frank Act relates to the transparency of our balance sheet and liquidity programs. Well before enactment, we were providing a great deal of relevant information on our website, in statistical releases, and in regular reports to the Congress. Under a framework established by the act, the Federal Reserve will, by December 1, provide detailed information regarding individual transactions conducted across a range of credit and liquidity programs over the period from December 1, 2007, to July 20, 2010. This information will include the names of counterparties, the date and dollar value of individual transactions, the terms of repayment, and other relevant information. On an ongoing basis, subject to lags specified by the Congress to protect the efficacy of the programs, the Federal Reserve also will routinely provide information regarding the identities of counterparties, amounts financed or purchased and collateral                                                  1  See Ben S.

To conclude, the Dodd-Frank Act is an important step forward for financial regulation in the United States, and it is essential that the act be carried out expeditiously and effectively. The Federal Reserve will work closely with our fellow regulators, the Congress, and the Administration to ensure that the law is implemented in a manner that best protects the stability of our financial system and strengthens the U.S. economy.  
Linah K Mohohlo: Post-recession role of accountants in business Speech by Ms Linah K Mohohlo, Governor of the Bank of Botswana, to the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants, Gaborone, 17 September 2010. *      *      * I would like to begin by thanking the Country Manager of Botswana’s Association of Certified Chartered Accountants, Ms Gwen Sabarwal, for inviting me to be a part of the Association’s Gala Dinner for 2010.  I am informed that it is the Association’s tradition on this occasion to invite a notable person in the community to speak on some issue of topical interest. It humbles me, therefore, that I have been considered worthy of the platform for this year’s event. You will agree that this time round, for me, any topical issue is bound to be coloured by, and related to, the recent global financial meltdown and related deepest economic recession since the great depression of the 1930s. The causes of the difficult economic episode are now common knowledge, with sources from private and public sectors at individual and collective levels, in areas of public policy, corporate strategy and business operations. In other words, all professions, including accountancy, contributed directly or indirectly to the economic meltdown. Now, everyone is looking through the rear view mirror while at the same time focussing on the road ahead.  Before delving more on the issues, I would like to commend your Association (Ms Sabarwal) for the commitment to training accountants in Botswana over the years. It is encouraging to learn that, since 1990, two years following the enactment of the relevant legislation, the membership of the Association of Certified Chartered Accountants in Botswana has grown to more than 350, and the student in-take has continued to increase. It is also encouraging to observe that the more than 96 percent membership retention level you have so far achieved is fairly comparable internationally. This should provide confidence that you will reach your 2010/2011 retention target of 98 percent with relative ease.  However, I happen to know that there is a big deficit in the supply of accountants in Botswana. Apparently the demand in the market is about 3 000, while the supply is just over 1 000, the lion’s share of which are expatriates. I have no doubt that your Association shares this concern, given the fact that the shortage of professionals in accounting and related disciplines can only raise costs and, therefore, be unaffordable for many small and medium size enterprises. It could constrain business performance and deprive the economy generally of needed guidance in business governance, ethics, strategy and planning, with possible adverse consequences on sustenance of economic diversification and a relatively high growth rate for the economy. It is my hope, therefore, that steps will be taken to redress the situation, and this could include deliberate public policy intervention.  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, the theme I was requested to address is Accountants for Business. I believe this broad theme is currently guiding your exchange of views in your profession and, as a matter of fact, it will be addressed further at the World Congress of Accountants that is tenable in Malaysia next month.  For this evening, I have chosen to put a slant to the topic and speak on The Post-Recession Role of Accountants in Business. In this case, the word “business” is broadly and loosely intended to mean institutions (corporate or non-corporate, private or public) that are engaged in production of goods and/or services.  Although the global economic recession, from which we are slowly emerging, was, by and large, the result of a wide-ranging systems failure, I will confine my remarks to some of the lapses of the accounting profession that contributed to the economic meltdown. I will also highlight some lessons learned and some on-going remedial measures that should prevent a recurrence. I will then raise the issue of the need to increase the supply and quality of BIS Review 124/2010 1 
accountants in Botswana and urge you to be actively engaged in the area of accounting principles and reporting. This will be my main message, but at the end of my remarks, I will digress only a little and share with you some issues of public interest that fall within the purview of the mandate of the Bank, and in which accountants are undoubtedly interested.  It is now clear that the financial crisis and economic recession were the result of cumulative lapses in good corporate governance, particularly with respect to transparency in management, policy formulation and operational procedures. This includes a clear hierarchy of institutional structures such as boards, management and stakeholders, with well defined functional responsibilities to ensure accountability in organisations. There were lapses in enforcing checks and balances, prevention of conflicts of interest and adherence to fiduciary responsibility. Above all, in many instances, there was a lack of honesty, selflessness, integrity, openness, ethical conduct and responsible corporate citizenry. By and large, accountants and other professionals at various levels of responsibility, and in a good number of financial and non-financial businesses, disregarded these cardinal guiding principles of good corporate governance and conveniently forgot that what is legal is not necessarily ethical. In the end, the financial and economic structure could not bear the weight of accumulated lapses; so, it collapsed.  While all this is now water under the bridge, it has been recognised in some quarters that the International Accounting Standards contributed more than their fair share to the financial crisis. It is pointed out that one new standard abandoned the traditional prudent principle of historical asset valuation and replaced it with a highly subjective and pro-cyclical “fair value” concept. As a result, brokers, analysts and investment bankers abused the standard. The upward movement of stock prices immediately inflated balance sheets which, in turn, further inflated the asset price and, when the economic downturn set in, the bubble eventually burst. It was known that the paper profits resulting from inflated asset book values could not be realised; and yet banks and other non-bank institutions took inordinate debt issuance risks. In addition, the “fair-value” principle was not much understood by the market, and was not transparent. In the event, balance sheets were hardly a useful basis for decision-making by economic agents. The far reaching economic and social consequences of this accounting practice are now a matter of record.  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been said that war is too serious a business to be left to the generals only. Likewise, it is now widely recognised that accounting is too important a profession to be left to accountants only. Indeed the United States of America and the European Union recently took measures to “soften” or dilute, as it were, the deleterious effects of “fair-value” accounting practice in financial institutions. Another emerging change is the call for more disclosures in accounting standards with which those of us outside the profession are grappling, obviously with the helping hand of accountants.  Long gone are the days when accountants confined themselves to the boring ivory tower of “number crunching” or, as at times pejoratively referred to, “bean counting”. In fact, it has been said that accounting has now entered a golden age; an age of the changing role of the accountant; an age of wide-ranging roles that include professional business advice, planning, reporting, identification of value drivers and risk mitigation. In particular, it is increasingly desirable that the International Accounting Standards should incorporate disclosures of payments to governments by companies in the extraction of natural resources, especially those in the oil, gas and timber sectors. This needs to be done in both the public and private sectors to ensure that maximum revenue and other benefits accrue to the societies in which these companies operate. More generally, the accounting profession has cross-cutting socio-economic responsibility in a variety of ways including governance, business ethics, banking regulations and supervision, as well as financial stability.  In this respect, climate change and its effects have opened up new horizons in which accountants can be involved in a wide range of socio-economic issues. It is my hope that 2 BIS Review 124/2010 
accountants from developing countries will take the lead in putting in place the necessary accounting and reporting standards on costing and financing of the mitigation of adverse socio-economic effects of climate change. These were agreed on at last year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. You will agree that this is a multi-disciplinary area which, I believe, will involve close consultations between your profession as accountants and other disciplines. Here at home, the Financial Reporting Bill that was passed by Parliament recently, and awaiting Presidential approval, will contribute considerably in widening the scope for the responsibilities of the accounting profession. Similarly, when the Botswana Accounting Oversight Authority is put in place, it should strengthen the professional accountability and ethical conduct of accountants.  As a related matter, Ladies and Gentlemen, you will know that, in a bid to circumvent a possible repeat of the recent financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reached a landmark decision on September 12, 2010. This is known as Basel III, and it translates into a more than doubling of the common equity component of capital for global banks, from the current 2 percent to 4.5 percent, plus a new buffer of a further 2.5 percent, to reach a floor of 7 percent. The effective implementation of this new capital adequacy requirement is the period 2013–2019, and it is meant to make banks resilient to financial shocks and ensure a more healthy banking sector worldwide. Any bank capital falling within the buffer zone will face restrictions on paying dividends and discretionary bonuses. We await more of these proclamations and transformations going forward as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision continues to be hard at work. As a matter of fact, the Basel Committee is catching up with Botswana’s regulatory framework on this matter. It should be of interest that the Bank of Botswana has, for more than 10 years now, insisted that domestic banks should maintain a capital adequacy ratio of 15 percent, which is more than double the new Basel Committee’s minimum requirement. It should not come as a surprise, therefore, that, throughout the financial crisis, the domestic banking sector remained well capitalised, sound and profitable.  While on the subject of the domestic banking sector, let me digress a bit into an example of the Bank of Botswana’s accountability to stakeholders on delivery of all its mandates, which include monetary policy, the objective of which is to maintain low, predictable and sustainable level of inflation. In meeting the inflation objective the Bank absorbs the banking system’s excess funds by issuing Bank of Botswana Certificates, thus containing undesirable credit growth and determining the appropriate level of the Bank Rate. There is no doubt that not issuing central bank paper in the form of Bank of Botswana Certificates to absorb excess liquidity in the banking system would be inflationary and destabilising to the economy. And yet there is a view in some quarters that the cost of absorbing excess liquidity is too high, and banks would do the right thing if left to themselves; that somehow, the Bank is enriching commercial banks. The Bank of course disagrees with these views. In fact, the “leave-banks-and-their-excess-funds-alone” view runs counter to experience world-wide. On the contrary, banks cannot be left to accumulate excess money and be expected to do the right thing. In fact, it would be the height of irresponsibility if the Bank were not to intervene in the face of the continuing excess liquidity that is exclusively in the banking system. Indeed accountants, such as yourselves, would be concerned about unhealthy balance sheets resulting from, among others, the vagaries of what would no doubt be runaway inflation, as was the case for several years before BoBCs were introduced in 1991.  With respect to the Banks’ responsibility of reigning in inflation by managing banking system liquidity and credit expansion, there is the related need for banks to encourage financial saving. It is well known that bank lending and investment which are a basis for the country’s development cannot increase without attracting a faster rate of accumulating savings. The Bank is concerned that household voluntary savings rates are low, while borrowing levels are high compared to countries at a similar level of development. Commercial banks must, BIS Review 124/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 124/2010 therefore, seriously consider developing savings products that offer attractive deposit interest rates, in their own long-term interest, rather than concentrating on short-term gains by maintaining wide spreads between lending and deposit interest rates and, at the same time, charging exorbitantly for the services rendered. Rest assured, this and other related matters are receiving the Bank’s active attention.  Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, we await the next course of the meal to be served, and I do not want to frustrate your appetite further. This, therefore, concludes my submissions.  Please accept my best wishes for a pleasant and relaxing evening. I thank you for your attention. 
José De Gregorio: Macroprudential regulation, financial stability and capital flows Presentation by Mr José De Gregorio, Governor of the Central Bank of Chile, at the 13th Annual International Banking Conference, Chicago, 24 September 2010. *      *      * I am very grateful to Gabriel Aparici, Herman Bennett, Kevin Cowan and Pablo Garcia for very useful discussions and comments. I am grateful to the Chicago Fed for inviting me to participate in this important policy panel. Most recent conferences on macro and financial policies have been dealing with the causes, consequences and implications of the financial crisis of late 2008 and early 2009, and the Great Recession that ensued. This panel has been persuasively entitled Where to from Here? I would like to focus on two issues: capital inflows, which is a very relevant issue for emerging market economies, and the recent agreement of the Basel Committee on Banking Regulation. For this purpose I will start with a brief review of some facts regarding capital inflows. Then I will discuss the policy toolkit to deal with them. I will take a look from a macro perspective and then from the point of view of financial stability. Finally I will make some comments on the Basel agreements, focusing on the Chilean banking system and its financial regulation framework. Some evidence and factors behind the resumption of inflows There is concern in emerging market economies about resuming capital inflows and the challenges they impose on monetary policy. I will first refer to some stylized facts and factors behind the recent surge in capital inflows, and then on the policy challenges. Monetary policy in the developed world has had to take on the burden of cyclical stimulus. Hence, policy interest rates in the main high-income economic zones have been kept low for longer than expected at the end of last year, and several central banks have actually reinforced traditional monetary policy with further unconventional measures. The discussion about exit strategies has morphed into further balance-sheet stimulus, and markets are pricing-in that monetary accommodation will continue well into 2011. In contrast to the situation in the largest developed economies, emerging markets and some financially-stable developed countries have transited to a quick recovery phase, which in some cases is leading to above-trend growth and the fast closure of output slack. Macroeconomic policy has responded accordingly, first through the normalization of extraordinary liquidity and financial stability measures, then by moderating their fiscal and monetary impulses. Interest rates in emerging economies have, therefore, started to increase and are, according to most expectations, slated to continue increasing over the course of the next few years. These monetary policy trends have naturally led to discussions regarding their implications for capital flows, current accounts, economic growth, and real exchange rates. In particular, some concerns have been voiced about the risk of returning to a situation much like the one observed in the mid 2000s, when low interest rates in the developed world boosted capital flows into emerging economies. With the purpose of increasing their liquidity safeguards and stabilizing real exchange rates, official reserves in emerging economies, accumulated through sterilized interventions, precluded current account adjustment, artificially boosting tradable sector growth. This led to global imbalances and, so the argument goes, facilitated (or even caused) global financial unrest. BIS Review 124/2010 1 
The above argument depends on whether capital inflows to emerging economies, which were indeed substantial in 2006–2008 (see Figure 1), are driven primarily by interest rate differentials or by medium term growth prospects. It is noteworthy to see how these interest rate differentials have evolved over time. Figure 2 plots (simple) average monetary policy rates for a group of developed and emerging economies, as well as Chile. It is striking that, whereas on average it stood at 440 basis points (bp) between January 2006 and July 2008, now it is barely 50 bp lower (390 bp). Intriguingly, market expectations for interest rate differentials hover between 400 bp and 450 bp over the next year. It would require substantial sensitiveness to interest rate differentials to make the argument that these are the main drivers of capital inflows. Moreover, the decade from 1996 to 2005 witnessed an average differential above 1000 bp, affected of course by risk premia, but still indicates that crude short-term interest rate differentials by themselves are not suggestive of substantial capital inflows. In terms of growth prospects, the picture is markedly different. Figure 3 presents IMF’s past data and forecasts for economic growth in developed and emerging economies. It is clear that, from 2000 to 2010, the growth differential between developed and emerging economies widened significantly, reaching around 5.5% between 2007 and 2010. Hence, the Great Recession did not affect significantly this growth differential, and prospects for the near term also indicate that growth in emerging economies will outpace growth in developed economies, but at a rate (4%–4.5%) not that different from the average between 2003 and 2005. A simple observation of the data therefore suggests that growth differentials are more important in driving capital inflows than interest rate differentials. The latter have remained quite stable for several years, and the main stylized fact of the past decade and a half has been a significant shrinkage of short term interest rates in emerging economies. A more suggestive interpretation of these broad medium-term trends is that high growth in emerging economies attracted capital inflows. Prudent macroeconomic management in emerging economies (especially compared to previous decades), allowed an improvement in external and fiscal solvency, alongside appreciation pressures. These factors helped implement lower interest rates. This different macroeconomic backdrop has also implied that today current account balances in emerging economies do not display the significant deficits observed in the run-up to crises during the 1980s or 1990s (Figure 4). The lack of a significant widening of the current account deficits should also indicate that current concerns about (net) capital flows into emerging economies could be premature, although for specific economies they could be posing more immediate policy challenges. Dealing with capital inflows Traditionally, the primary concern in emerging market economies about large capital inflows has been that they may be financing an unsustainable current account deficit that could derive in a sudden stop of capital inflows. A sudden stop scenario is particularly costly since it involves a painful restructuring of the economy from non-tradables to tradables and a large correction in the exchange rate with potentially large balance sheet effects, which could result in high volatility and output losses. This view regarding large capital inflows has largely been shaped by current account crises like the ones in Mexico and East Asia in the 1990s. As the evidence I showed, the current account in emerging market economies still displays, on average, a surplus. Therefore, they do not currently present a serious threat, but it is necessary to explore the policy implications of large capital inflows.1                                                  1  Here I will discuss briefly the main tools from a macro point of view. For further discussion on these policy options, see De Gregorio (2010a).  2 BIS Review 124/2010 
In many experiences capital inflows have been exacerbated by policy actions. Most noteworthy are the attempts of authorities to defend an artificially weak currency. The expectations of an appreciation generated by this policy create further incentives for capital inflows. For this reason a flexible exchange rate should be the first line of defense. This is also consistent with providing the monetary authority independence to use monetary policy. However, and as I discuss below, this may not be enough to ensure macroeconomic stability. Monetary policy in the context of an inflation targeting regime also contributes to stability by leaning against the wind. Capital inflows that lead to an appreciation of the currency reduce inflationary pressures allowing for an interest rate cut. This, in turn, reduces incentives to capital inflows and takes pressure off the currency.  This phenomenon has been recently experienced in Chile. In recent weeks, the peso has appreciated significantly. At the same time the economy has been showing a rapid expansion: despite the earthquake we suffered this year growth is expected to be between 5% and 5.5% this year and between 5.5% and 6.5% next year. Although in our latest Monetary Policy Report we said that the bank will keep withdrawing the significant monetary stimulus, without the strengthening of the currency the withdrawal would certainly be faster. However, these macro policy actions may not be enough, in particular because capital inflows may be a source of bubbles in domestic asset prices. Indeed, in emerging markets bubbles normally take the form of an exchange rate appreciation. In this way, all assets become overpriced, not necessarily by higher prices in domestic currency, which may also be happening, but by increasing the value of the currency. A much debated issue in industrial countries has been whether tightening monetary policy could help burst a bubble in asset prices. Although, in general, I think that monetary policy should not target asset prices, nor should it be used as an instrument to deal with asset prices, the problem is more acute regarding capital inflows. If capital inflows fuel a bubble in the exchange rate, tightening monetary policy will actually induce more capital inflows. Paradoxically, monetary policy loosening may help to stabilize the economy and lead to a slowdown in the rise in asset prices.2 Misalignments of the exchange rate, in particular in the context of massive inflows, may be the prelude of problems, in the extreme a currency or financial meltdown. For this reason other tools cannot be ruled out, in particular exchange rate intervention. To avoid the perils of introducing rigidities in the exchange rate regime, interventions should be truly exceptional and should not target a particular exchange rate value. Hence, the volatility of the exchange rate is not artificially lowered, and appreciation expectations are not introduced. If the currency is misaligned from fundamentals, the intervention may be successful in realigning the currency. If not, sterilized intervention will most likely be ineffective, and for this reason is important to have a strong presumption that the currency has moved away from fundamentals before intervening.3 In addition, foreign exchange intervention allows authorities to increase the international liquidity position of the economy so as to insure against a future curtailment of capital inflows.  Naturally, a booming economy, with a widening current account deficit, persistent appreciation and low inflation may need some stabilization if the expansion is deemed to be unsustainable. Fiscal policy could help, but unfortunately it is not always available, especially in countries with a weak fiscal history. Another tool, with weak evidence supporting its                                                  2 For further discussion on the use of monetary policy to affect asset prices, in particular in the context of inflation targeting in open economies, see De Gregorio (2010b). 3 In economies following inflation targets is important that the intervention be coherent with the inflation outlook to avoid undermining credibility. Intervention can also be part of unconventional policies to reach the inflation target when interest rates are close to the zero lower bound. BIS Review 124/2010 3 
effectiveness, is capital controls.4 Regardless of whether they are effective or not, they may hide policy distortions. For example, policymakers thinking that capital controls are effective at insulating the economy from capital inflows, may tighten monetary policy to slowdown the expansion, but instead induce further inflows that look for loopholes to avoid the controls. For this reason I think that a more promising avenue is to look at the impact of capital inflows on financial stability. Indeed, many of the booms in asset prices and activity that come with capital inflows are caused and amplified in the financial system. Capital inflows and financial stability From the macro point of view, I have emphasized currency risks associated to capital inflows. A flexible exchange rate should help mitigate this risk. In addition, the development of the foreign exchange derivatives market should allow private agents to hedge against currency risk. In addition, capital inflows may be behind the development of bubbles in domestic asset prices, and there are also macro tools to deal with them. However, there are other risks that must be considered, which have implications on macro prudential regulation. Note that these risks may be relevant even when net capital flows are limited. Therefore, from the standpoint of financial stability, gross flows become relevant determinants of fragilities. These risks associated to capital inflows are: funding and credit risks. Regarding funding risk, large capital inflows in the form of short-term loans to local banks will tend to increase banks’ dependence on this external funding source, which has been shown to be a volatile source of funding. From the point of view of central banks, the accumulation of reserves may help mitigate the economy-wide consequences of this risk, but the soundness of the banking system must be safeguarded with the proper regulation. As for credit risk, large capital inflows in the form of loans to local banks and portfolio debt securities may translate into an increase in the credit supply as local intermediaries and corporations access more elastic and often cheaper sources of funding (beside currency risk). This increase in the supply of credit in the local economy could fuel a credit boom, which in turn could translate into an excessive leveraging in the economy and an increase in banks’ credit risk. Furthermore, screening by external lenders may be more imperfect than local screening, which can lead to over-indebtedness of domestic corporations and to increase the credit risk of the local intermediaries that have already lent to these corporations. To address these risks, prudential regulation is needed. In this regard, overall liquidity requirements, in particular those associated to foreign short-term funding, provision policies to address the credit risk associated with large capital inflows, and currency mismatch restrictions are key areas on which authorities should focus attention. To the extent that banks are the primary source of local financial intermediation, prudential regulation has the virtue that it targets the problem directly – i.e., it targets the financial intermediaries where the credit and funding risks are incubating. However, when designing regulation it must be considered that focusing on prudential regulation to the banking system can foster banking disintermediation in favor of less regulated financial intermediaries, which certainly goes against the spirit of macroprudential measures. Indeed, the global financial crisis has taught us the dangers of generating a parallel unregulated banking system and steps must be taken to limit this risky behavior must be taken, by enlarging the scope of regulation and limiting the extent of banking activities.                                                  4  The existing evidence for the case of Chile shows no significant effects on inflows or the real exchange rate, and limited effects on composition of inflows (Cowan and De Gregorio, 2007). See Ostry et al. (2010) for further discussion on capital controls and conditions for them to be used. 4 BIS Review 124/2010 
An important aspect of this regulation is whether it should be adjusted according to the availability of capital inflows, or whether it should be time invariant. Let me share some thoughts with you on this issue. First of all, macro-prudential regulation should aim at reducing a risk build-up that could lead to episodes of systemic financial instability. It is not a counter-cyclical macroeconomic tool. Interest rate policy should be the main counter-cyclical tool for central banks. This being said, regulation should not introduce additional procyclicality into the financial system. In Chile, for example, provisions are done on the basis of expected losses during the life of the credit. This stops short of the Spanish dynamic provisioning rule, but reduces the procyclical impact of regulation, in particular compared to the method of constituting provisions according to actual losses. Second, although desirable in several aspects, it seems to me that financial stability (and the build-up of risks) is such a multidimensional concept that either hinders the possibility of rules based macro-prudential policy or limits it to certain aspects (for example, dynamic provisions), which must be supplemented with additional discretionary measures. This implies that central banks (or whoever is responsible for systemic stability) must either have the regulatory tools at their disposal, or must have the adequate channels to convey these risks to the institutions that do have regulatory discretion. In Chile, for example, although there is a separate bank Superintendency (SBIF), the Central Bank has regulatory authority over several aspects that relate to systemic financial stability. For banks, these relate with the authorization to use derivatives, regulation regarding market and liquidity risk, and others. In other areas, the Central Bank also has a say in “systemic” regulation such as overall limits for Pension Funds. This scheme accommodates recent policy concerns, since it avoids the conflict of interests that arises from mixing the micro supervisor with the monetary authority, while preserving an institution that provides a broad look at the stability of the financial system. This being said, however, there is a need to continue strengthening coordination instances with other regulators. In this sense I think that the establishment of a Financial Stability Committee, very much in line with the one established here in the United States, is a promising avenue to take.  “Basel III” and the Chilean banking system When discussing financial stability these days one cannot help thinking of the recent agreements of the Basel Committee on Banking Regulation, which are a positive step forward in strengthening the banking system. However, I would like to highlight that many emerging market economies already fulfill most of the requirements agreed upon for early 2019. This is an important factor explaining why, contrary to many other experiences with international crises, the financial systems of emerging market economies were extremely resilient during the global financial crisis, and expansionary monetary policies have been very effective because of well functioning financial systems. I will illustrate these points with the case of Chile.  Even though capital requirements in the Chilean banking industry still follow Basel I (only credit risk-weighted assets), it is possible to infer that the new BIS capital requirements do not appear restrictive. In fact, considering estimated capital charges due to market and operational risk, Tier 1 and Total Capital indicators are considerably above the BIS minima for 2019 (Table 1). This capital looseness allows for coverage of the conservation buffer and also the countercyclical buffer. As for common equity, more precision is needed. In its most acid definition, common equity corresponds to “paid-in capital”, which represents approximately 65% of Tier 1 capital. In somewhat looser definitions, retained earnings may be accounted for as common equity, which in that case may capture as much as 70% of Tier 1 capital. Either way, implementing a limit on the common equity to risk-weighted assets (RWA) ratio should not represent severe restrictions. Additionally, the Tier 1 leverage ratio for the Chilean banking system is BIS Review 124/2010 5 
approximately 7%, more than twice the BIS preliminary suggestion. The healthy capital condition of the industry average is reflected at the individual bank level (Figure 5). No liquidity indicator was specified, but the introduction of such a minimum standard as of 2015 was agreed upon. Regardless, the Chilean regulatory framework for bank liquidity considers quantitative limits on maturity mismatches over 30- and 90-day periods in local and foreign currencies, which should provide a reasonable starting point for the application of further BIS requirements in the medium term. Despite a promising start, it is clear that there are still many aspects in which reform is still needed. Addressing the risks posed by systemically important institutions is one such area. It seems clear at this stage that systemic institutions should be subject to stricter supervision and regulation. Moreover, there is a lot of recent work on determining which institutions are truly “systemic.”5 What I miss, however, is more discussion on regulation that directly limits the size of institutions. In Chile, for example, after a severe financial crisis in 1983 with close to 15% fall in output, a strong banking law was enacted, which has been improved over the years. There are several legal regulations designed to prevent or reduce the impact of financial distress in large financial institutions. In this field, one of the most important measures considered relates to operations and transactions that may lead a bank to obtain a significant market share. These operations require authorization by the SBIF which may also impose conditions to such authorizations.6 For example, the SBIF may require that the effective net worth of the bank or banks involved be more than 8% and up to 14% of their risk-weighted assets; or demand that the limit of the loans granted by a bank to another financial institution be reduced to 20% of the effective net worth (section 35, banking law). Concluding remarks The challenges facing emerging market economies are different from those of industrial countries. While the latter struggle with ensuring a sustained recovery from the Great Recession, the former have to manage a healthy and vigorous process of growth, which is not exempt from tensions. The need of the world to rebalance saving-investment across countries will have as counterpart capital flows adjustments. Exchange rate flexibility, avoiding serious misalignments, should help to smooth this process. It is tempting to think that emerging economies did not suffer the financial crisis for having better regulatory framework than industrial ones. However, the issue is somewhat more complicated. In some way, emerging markets enjoyed also less complexities and smaller sized financial systems. For the current level of development and the size of the financial system, regulations appear to have worked fine. But, the challenge is how to allow continued financial development in the context of a solid financial system. For this reason it is very important to learn from mistakes in more mature markets, and to participate and analyze coming changes in the global financial landscape.                                                   5  See IMF (2010), chapter 2, and references contained in it, for a discussion of balance sheet and asset co-movement approaches to determining systemic institutions. 6  Actually, the SBIF may deny authorization to any bank merger, acquisition of assets of a bank by another banking entity, or taking control of two o more existing banks by the same person or group, or to increase substantially the existing control if the acquiring bank that performs said merger, acquisition or the resulting group of banks reaches a significant market share. In order to deny authorization, the SBIF needs prior approval by the Central Bank Board, issued by the majority of all Board members. 6 BIS Review 124/2010

Masaaki Shirakawa: Japan’s economy and monetary policy Speech by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Osaka, 27 September 2010. *      *      * Introduction I am privileged to be here today to speak and exchange views with business leaders from the Kansai region. I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to you for your cooperation with the Bank of Japan’s branches in Osaka, Kobe, and Kyoto. At present, the greatest concern for the time being for you as business leaders must be the recent appreciation of the yen and its impact on Japan’s economy. Before we exchange views, I will first outline developments in the global economy and associated trends in the foreign exchange markets. I will then speak about Japan’s economic situation and the Bank’s thinking on monetary policy. I. Developments in the global economy I will start with developments in the global economy. Since the spring of 2009, the global economy, driven particularly by emerging economies, has continued to grow at about 5 percent on an annual basis. While it is natural to have high growth rates as the global economy has been recovering from the plunge following the Lehman shock, the growth rate figures have substantially exceeded the average annual growth rate of 3.9 percent over the 10 years prior to the Lehman shock. However, the pace of growth has slowed somewhat recently, partly because the effects of various demand-boosting policy measures introduced in response to the financial crisis in the advanced economies of the United States and Europe have started to recede and emerging economies have been shifting away from accommodative monetary policies. In the United States, while production continues to increase on the back of buoyant exports, concern has increased about a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy as many indicators related to domestic demand, especially indicators of private consumption and housing, have been pointing since the second half of July to a slower economic recovery. Economic activity in the euro area is recovering moderately as a whole, but economic disparities in the area have widened: while exports and production in the main economies, especially Germany, have been boosted by the depreciation of the euro, economic growth in peripheral countries such as Greece has been sluggish as both the public and private sectors are mired in excessive debt. Meanwhile, emerging economies are growing robustly. In this situation, many emerging countries have been moving away from accommodative monetary policies as they seek to contain economic overheating and follow more sustainable economic growth paths. Although the rate of global economic growth is still at a high level, it has been slowing. Nevertheless, the global economy’s recovery trend appears to remain intact. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the global economy will continue to achieve growth rates of over 4 percent in the coming years, projecting growth of 4.6 percent in 2010 and 4.3 percent in 2011. Nevertheless, the Bank considers that, regarding the outlook, the downside risks to the U.S. and European economies and their potential impact warrant more attention. The U.S. economy is burdened by balance-sheet adjustments similar to those experienced in Japan following the collapse of the bubble. Therefore, it has become more difficult for it to grow but easier for it to deteriorate. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has also expressed the view that the U.S. economy would continue to expand in the second half of 2010, albeit at a relatively modest pace, and it was reasonable BIS Review 123/2010 1 
to expect some pickup in growth in 2011. He also stated that macroeconomic projections were inherently uncertain, and the U.S. economy remained vulnerable to unexpected developments. II. Developments in the foreign exchange markets Bearing these global economic developments in mind, we can now turn to the recent developments in the foreign exchange markets. Looking back at movements in the U.S. dollar-yen exchange rate, the yen traded at around 90 yen against the U.S. dollar until the middle of 2010, but then appreciated since August and temporarily reached the range of 82–83 yen. The key factor behind the appreciation appears to be heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, particularly the U.S. economy. Until around the spring of 2010, there were discussions in the United States on how to make the shift away from the accommodative monetary policies put in place after the financial crisis. However, as indicators suggesting the weakness in the U.S. economy have been released successively since the summer, as I mentioned earlier, the discussions about monetary policy exit strategies have been put on hold. In these circumstances of heightened uncertainty over the global economy, investors worldwide have increasingly avoided risks and purchased currencies that are considered to be relatively safe. For example, since July, the yen has risen by 3 percent, and the Swiss franc by 8 percent, against the U.S. dollar. Moreover, the yen has appreciated not only against the U.S. dollar and the euro but also against fellow East Asian currencies: for example, it has traded at levels close to its record high against the Korean won. Needless to say, the appreciation of the yen weighs directly on the profits and profitability of exporting firms. And in the current situation, it can also significantly affect business sentiment and consequently the outlook for Japan’s economy, by increasing uncertainty over the global economy. In these circumstances, an intervention was conducted in the currency markets for the first time in six and a half years. The Japanese government has made it clear that it will continue to pay due attention to developments in the foreign exchange markets, and will take decisive actions, including interventions, if it deems it necessary. Likewise, the Bank also has great interest in and will pay close attention to developments in the foreign exchange markets and their impact. III. Developments in and medium- to long-term challenge for Japan’s economy Developments in Japan’s economy I will now move on to economic activity and prices in Japan. The Bank assesses that Japan’s economy shows further signs of a moderate recovery. Exports and production continue on an increasing trend, albeit at a slower pace compared with the pace of increase of more than 20 percent per year that had been seen since the spring of 2009. As for domestic private demand, business fixed investment is showing signs of picking up, albeit at a low level, as corporate profits continue to steadily improve. The employment and income situation remains severe, but the degree of severity has eased somewhat as the number of employees and wages have increased slightly. Private consumption has been picking up. Particularly, buoyed by the effects of the extremely hot summer this year, sales at convenience stores, especially of beverages, have been increasing recently, as have sales of air conditioners supported by the eco-point system. And as you know, there was also a last-minute increase in demand for automobiles ahead of the expiration of subsidies for purchasing energy-efficient cars. 2 BIS Review 123/2010 
As for the outlook, the pace of economic improvement is likely to slow for the time being due to the ending of the boost from the extremely hot summer and to the absence going forward of the recent last-minute increase in demand for durable consumer goods. Looking back, partly because Japan experienced the sharpest economic downturn among advanced economies following the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, Japan’s economy subsequently recovered at the fastest pace. In any event, as factored into the forecasts presented in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices released in April, the Bank has been fully aware that the pace of economic recovery is likely to slow over the second half of fiscal 2010 as inventory restocking runs its course and the effects of policy measures wane. However, it should be noted that in Japan, unlike in the United States and Europe, balance-sheet adjustments are not weighing on the economy and both financial markets and the financial system are stable. This suggests that an accommodative financial environment has been in place to support the economic activity of firms and households. Given this, assuming that overseas economies maintain their moderate recovery, the trend of recovery itself in Japan is not likely to be interrupted. On the price front, the year-on-year decline in the consumer price index (CPI) reached a record level of 2.4 percent in the summer of 2009 and has been moderating gradually thereafter. The decline has recently slowed to around 0.6 percent, if the effects of subsidies for high school tuition are excluded. The pace of decline is expected to continue to slow as the economy follows a recovery path and the aggregate supply and demand balance improves. The outlook I have just described is the Bank’s baseline scenario for economic activity and prices, but the Bank fully recognizes that this scenario contains a high degree of uncertainty. There is increasing uncertainty about the outlook for the global economy, especially the U.S. economy, and the foreign exchange and stock markets have been unstable. There is also a possibility that private consumption and production could decline substantially if the effects of the ending of the boost from the extremely hot summer and the absence going forward of the recent last-minute increase in demand for durable consumer goods such as automobiles are larger than expected. Based on these points, the Bank deemed it necessary to pay attention to the downside risks to Japan’s economic activity and prices. Medium- to long-term challenge confronting Japan’s economy I have outlined the current situation of Japan’s economy. At present, it shows further signs of a moderate recovery. But putting aside such short-term economic developments, what many people see as the greatest problem for Japan’s economy is that they do not have confidence in Japan’s medium- to long-term growth potential, or in other words, that they are finding it difficult to envisage a blueprint for growth. In fact, Japan’s economic growth rate is on a declining trend. Aside from the high-growth era when the average annual rate of economic growth was slightly below 10 percent, in the 1980s the average annual growth rate was around 4.5 percent, which exceeded the growth rates of other advanced economies. However, following the collapse of the bubble, Japan’s annual growth rate declined significantly to around 1.5 percent in the 1990s. It has then increased somewhat since the turn of the millennium, but the trend decline in the growth rate continues. In this situation, people will have lower expectations concerning future income growth and their spending and investment will be restrained, which will in turn lead to price declines. The deflation in Japan should be understood as a manifestation of the fundamental problem facing the economy, namely the decline in growth expectations. Even though Japan’s economic growth rate is trending downward, the GDP growth rate per worker, or, in other words, the productivity growth rate, has been 1.6 percent per year on average over the past decade. The rate has declined from earlier levels but exceeds the 0.8 percent level in European countries and is still comparable to the 1.8 percent level in the United States. At present, the percentage of the population aged 15 or older that is in BIS Review 123/2010 3 
employment, that is, the employment rate, is about 60 percent. If this rate declines further with the aging of the population, raising productivity will become an even more critical challenge. In attempting to raise productivity, it is important to recognize that, given the fierce global competition, doing so by cost reduction and improvement in cost structure alone has its own limits for the economy as a whole. For example, about 90 percent of the CPI inflation differential between Japan and the United States in the past 10 years was attributable to the difference in the rate of decline in service prices. This appears to reflect the fact that, in Japan, nominal wages have been adjusted flexibly. Of course, cost reduction should be an important part of firms’ strategies to enhance competitiveness, and Japanese firms have achieved productivity rises through their drastic efforts to cut costs. However, in a situation where the population is declining and existing domestic markets are starting to shrink, it is essential to create new markets that can enable firms to enjoy high profits, in order to raise the productivity of Japan’s economy as a whole. On this point, one view is that exploring new areas and creating new added value should be part of firms’ growth strategies. These strategies of exploring new, uncontested market places are known as “blue ocean” strategies. The search for such “blue oceans” is essential for sustainable productivity growth. This can be achieved by private firms’ innovative efforts and financial institutions’ support in the form of providing funds for such efforts. The policy authorities also play an important role in creating such an environment. The Japanese government is making efforts to achieve its growth strategies for Japan’s economy and I expect that they will be implemented steadily in the future. At the same time, the Bank has been considering ways to contribute to raising Japan’s growth potential by making use of the central bank’s functions. As a result, in June 2010 the Bank decided to introduce a new fund-provisioning measure to support efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. IV. Thinking behind monetary policy Let me now explain the Bank’s thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy. As I mentioned earlier, Japan’s economy faces the cyclical challenge of returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability and the medium- to long-term challenge of overcoming the trend decline in the growth rate. The Bank, while keeping in mind these two challenges, conducts monetary policy with a focus on the following three points. First, pursuing powerful monetary easing. The Bank has lowered the policy interest rate to 0.1 percent, virtually zero. It also introduced a new funds-supplying operation, which is called the “fixed-rate operation,” and by substantially increasing the amount of funds provided through the operation, has been encouraging a decline in market interest rates and further enhancing and spreading accommodative monetary conditions. Second, ensuring financial market stability. If financial institutions face difficulty in smoothly raising funds from the markets, they excessively restrain their lending and other financial activities, and this in turn seriously affects economic activity. The Bank will continue to fulfill its critical role of ensuring financial market stability. And third, supporting efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. As I mentioned before, in June 2010 the Bank introduced a new fund-provisioning measure through which it will provide long-term funds at a low interest rate to private financial institutions that are making efforts in terms of lending and investment to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. At the beginning of September, the Bank conducted the first loan disbursement through the measure, providing 47 financial institutions with a total of 462.5 billion yen. The Bank anticipates that the measure will act as a catalyst to further stimulate private firms’ efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. The number of financial institutions that intend to participate in the fund-provisioning measure to make efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth has exceeded 100. In 4 BIS Review 123/2010 
BIS Review 123/2010 5 addition, with the introduction of the measure, a considerable number of financial institutions established new dedicated funds as well as investment and lending schemes. The Bank recognizes that Japan’s economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation and returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability. To this end, the Bank will continue to consistently make the utmost contributions as a central bank with a focus on the three points that I have just mentioned: pursuing powerful monetary easing, ensuring financial market stability, and supporting efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. From the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2010, during which time the global economy posted relatively high growth, based on the experience after the collapse of the bubble in Japan the Bank made a very conservative judgment that, as balance-sheet adjustments were weighing on the U.S. and European economies, the pace of recovery in the global economy was likely to remain moderate and downside risks were prone to increase. As such, the Bank is the only central bank among advanced economies that has further enhanced monetary easing since December 2009. The Bank has also introduced a new measure to support efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. As these initiatives suggest, the Bank has been actively introducing various new measures to support Japan’s economy from the financial side, aiming to overcome deflation and return to a sustainable growth path with price stability. The Bank will continue to carefully consider the outlook for economic activity and prices, and, if it deems it necessary, will take policy actions in a timely and appropriate manner upon considering the effects and side-effects of various policy measures. 
Elizabeth A Duke: Opening remarks at the public hearing on potential revisions to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Opening remarks by Ms Elizabeth A Duke, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the public hearing on potential revisions to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, Washington DC, 24 September 2010. *      *      * Good Morning. On behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, I’d like to welcome everyone to the last of our series of public hearings held to discuss changes to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The knowledge and feedback we have gained from these hearings will help us to assess the adequacy of current mortgage data, examine the need for additional data, and explore possible changes to Regulation C, which implements HMDA. I’d like to thank our colleagues at the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, San Francisco, and Chicago for hosting the first three hearings.  Our series of hearings kicked off just as Congress passed regulatory reform legislation earlier this summer. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for some changes to HMDA data collection and submission, and we look forward to hearing from our panelists and members of the public about the implementation of these changes. The new law also transfers authority for HMDA rulemaking from the Board of Governors to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). All information gleaned from these hearings will inform our own work for the time that we continue to have rulewriting authority. When that authority transfers to the CFPB, be assured that we will hand over the most current thinking about changes to Regulation C.  Over the course of these hearings, we have heard from key players in the home mortgage market: lenders and other market participants, academics and researchers, consumer advocacy and community development organizations, data experts, regulators, and other public officials. Although they play different roles, we believe that all share a common goal: To ensure that the mortgage market is responsible, transparent, efficient, and serves the needs of consumers and market participants alike.  Clearly, the recent mortgage crisis has highlighted the potential ramifications of a mortgage market that is not functioning well. HMDA data do not create the market or solve all market problems, but they do help us understand what is happening in the market. The time is certainly ripe for reviewing and revising the data elements, standards, and reporting formats.  HMDA has three purposes. One is to provide the public and government officials with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located. A second is to help government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is needed. A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.  Today’s hearing is intended to serve as a venue to discuss whether or not the 2002 revisions to Regulation C provided useful and accurate information about the mortgage market, to gather information that will help assess the need for additional data elements or improvements, and to identify emerging issues in the mortgage market that may require additional research. As I said earlier, we are also interested in any comments on the implementation of the HMDA elements of the regulatory reform legislation.  We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a broad spectrum of vantage points, and we look forward to their comments. This input, together with the input of the preceding hearings and written comments submitted from the public, will be carefully weighed as we consider changes to Regulation C.

BIS Review 122/2010 1 Axel A Weber: Macroeconomic imbalances in the European Monetary Union – causes and policy challenges Speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the Kangaroo-Group/EPIC lunch, Strasbourg, 22 September 2010. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen First, I would like to thank you for your invitation. It is a pleasure to be here, and I am looking forward to discussing the problem of macroeconomic imbalances in European Monetary Union (EMU) with you. Intra-EMU divergencies and the resulting imbalances in current account positions are not a new phenomenon. In fact, they have existed since the beginning of the monetary union. However, in the pre-crisis years the associated problems were partly masked by strong global economic expansion and the continuing integration within the euro area. It was the financial crisis that revealed the structural nature of the divergencies, and they are now a prominent and controversial issue in public debate. In my speech, I would like to provide a brief overview of the causes of the intra-EMU divergencies and imbalances. Having laid the groundwork, I would then like to discuss what policy options we have in dealing with the imbalances. 2. Causes of macroeconomic imbalances in EMU 2.1 Diverging current accounts are not per se a problem … The public debate on divergencies within EMU focuses on the current account positions of member states; let us take a look at them first. Some member states such as Germany, Austria or the Netherlands have persistent current account surpluses. Other countries such as Portugal, Spain, Greece or Ireland show persistent current account deficits. In principle, a current account surplus or deficit reflects saving or borrowing at the national level. And, as for individuals, there is no reason why economies as a whole should not save or borrow. Consequently, there is no reason for current accounts to be balanced in equilibrium. A current account surplus or deficit reflects a discrepancy between domestic savings and investment. Such a discrepancy is not necessarily a bad thing. Consider the following examples: countries with an ageing population usually save more than they invest as they face declining domestic investment opportunities. Hence, they have temporary current account surpluses. At the same time, countries that are catching up on economic development usually invest more than they save as they have ample investment opportunities but are usually short of capital. As a consequence, they run temporary current account deficits. The common feature in both these cases is that the current account serves to smooth consumption over time, and thereby raising welfare. Thus, it has an inherent intertemporal dimension. As a result of the relationships I have just sketched, capital flows from countries with relatively large savings to countries with relatively high investment. In EMU this flow of capital was increased by the introduction of the euro. There were two reasons for this. First, exchange rate risk was eliminated, making cross-border investments less risky. Second, country default risks were increasingly perceived as converging towards a relatively low level. According to theory, the intra-EMU capital flows should reverse once investments in deficit countries start to pay off. However, in reality, diverging current account positions might also reflect underlying distortions – this was the case in EMU. 
2 BIS Review 122/2010 2.2 … but proved problematic in EMU The main problem for member states with current account deficits was that the inflow of capital was not always allocated efficiently. In Spain and Ireland it went into booming real estate markets, in Greece it funded high government deficits and in Portugal it supported private consumption. This allocation spurred internal demand and, owing to inflexible labour markets, wages increased more than productivity. This, in turn, reduced the competitiveness of the countries in question. As a consequence, imports increased, exports dwindled and the current account deficit grew further. Although these imbalances have domestic roots, the associated problems are not confined to the national level. Given spill-over effects in the closely integrated euro-area financial markets, they are also a problem for other member states and for the monetary union as a whole. The debt crisis in the first half of this year was a case in point. Its external effects mean the problem of divergencies and imbalances in EMU has to be solved. What are the policy options? 3. Policy options A major dispute regarding policy options is the question of which group of countries has to adjust. In an asymmetrical approach only the deficit countries would act while a symmetrical approach would require economic policy in both deficit and surplus countries to adjust. As I just argued, the deeper causes of the imbalances are domestic factors within the deficit countries. Hence, it is mainly incumbent on them to act. A number of structural reforms are necessary to enhance the competitiveness of domestic companies by increasing productivity and keeping costs in check. At the same time, the deficit countries have to increase labour market flexibility and consolidate government budgets. In the end, domestic absorption will have to return to a sustainable level. Proponents of a symmetrical approach say that surplus countries must also act. They claim that these countries have to boost domestic demand and, consequently, imports by using fiscal policy stimulus. It is also argued that surplus countries should raise wages, which would further increase domestic demand and at the same time reduce their competitiveness. However, when taking a closer look at these proposals, it becomes apparent that they are based on invalid assumptions. To demand measures that would boost imports neglects the fact that trade flows are highly diversified. Given the current trade structure, an increase in German imports by 10% would improve the current account balance in Spain, Portugal and Greece by a mere 0.25 percentage point. The current account balance in Ireland would improve by 1 percentage point. The proposal of raising wages to support domestic demand and reduce competitiveness does not only neglect that wages are not a political control variable. Moreover, simulation studies show that the effects would be confined almost entirely to the home economy in the form of changes in employment. Finally, the argument that fiscal policy should be used to stimulate internal demand and imports overlooks the fact that public finances in surplus countries are also strained and that ambitious consolidation efforts are required in these economies as well to restore the sustainability of public budgets. When looking at the international discussion, we must also bear in mind that the current account surpluses of China and, for instance, Germany are of a different nature – Germany does not manage its exchange rate nor does it impose capital controls. Nevertheless, what I just said does not imply that there is no need for reforms in surplus countries. Germany, for example, would benefit from more flexible labour markets and deregulated services and product markets. Improvements to the education system would also raise the economic potential. But these measures will not ease the need for adjustment in deficit countries. 
BIS Review 122/2010 3 4. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me summarise my speech. The large current account imbalances in EMU are mainly due to structural domestic imbalances in deficit countries. Given spillover effects in integrated euro-area financial markets, the imbalances are a serious strain on the monetary union as a whole. They must therefore be corrected. The relevant reform agenda has to centre on deficit countries. They will have to align demand and potential output more closely and, at the same time, consolidate government budgets. Compensatory measures by surplus countries would neither adequately address the problem nor would they bring notable relief to deficit economies. What can European policymakers contribute? In the long run, procedures to ensure fiscal policy commitment will have to be strengthened, for example by enhancing the Stability and Growth Pact. More effective macroeconomic surveillance and the development of a crisis resolution mechanism would, at least in the medium term, also be helpful. Thank you for your attention. 
BIS Review 122/2010 1 Ilmārs Rimšēvičs: Structural reforms to pave the way to prosperity in the future Speech by Mr Ilmārs Rimšēvičs, Governor of the Bank of Latvia, at the Baltic Economic Forum 2010, Riga, 23 September 2010. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen! I think only very few would have missed out that the Baltics have attracted a lot of international attention during the recent years. I would even venture to say that the three small countries located by the Baltic Sea – and Latvia above all – have stretched out their boundaries considerably to occupy an increasingly large part of the globe: they have suddenly become more noticeable than ever before. Obviously there must be something unique about these countries that has made them stand out during the recent crisis. It might be the flexibility of the Baltic tigers: they have shown themselves capable of making great leaps in both directions – forward and backward. The real uniqueness obviously lies in the way the economies have adjusted to the crisis and the magnitude of the economic swings they have experienced. Just a few short years ago we were amongst the strongest performers in the entire world and clearly the fastest growing economies within the EU. With Latvia leading the race, its GDP grew in the double digits on average for four consecutive years after the EU accession. Other Baltic neighbours followed suite. Blown up by the massive inflows of foreign funds and breathtaking lending growth, by the expansionary fiscal policy and remittances or repatriated wages – domestic demand ballooned bringing along an accelerating inflation and a widening current account deficit. Latvia was unique in recording a current account deficit as high as 27% of GDP during the peak quarters, and stunned the world by sustaining it above 20% for two years in a row. Inflation peaked at 18%, and real estate prices more than doubled in just a few years. Similar, but somewhat less extreme developments were observed in Lithuania and Estonia, with both inflation and current account deficits staying in the double digits during the boom years.  
2 BIS Review 122/2010  The booming economies rewarded their citizens with generous income flows. Labour markets soon became caught in a vice between massive demand pressures and limited supply of workers that was significantly constrained by labour outflows after the EU accession. This gave the rise to uncontrolled wage developments that by far outstripped productivity. Conventional wisdom told us this was leading to dead end. However, the temptation to reach the prosperity of Western Europe overnight prevailed, and the vicious circle of wages and prices kept tightening. Economies kept going and wage increases of 20–30% a year became a fact of life. In Latvia, salaries more than doubled between 2004 and 2008 opening a wide wage-productivity gap. Similar developments were recorded in Estonia, and somewhat less pronounced but still significant departure of wages from productivity was observed in Lithuania. Consequently all three countries suffered from a significant deterioration of cost competitiveness.  
BIS Review 122/2010 3  All these developments weakened the economies and made them extremely vulnerable to sudden changes in investor sentiment and global woes. Initially it seemed that the Baltic countries were easing into a soft landing. This was supported by banks cutting lending in a controlled way at the outset of the global financial crisis. However, the collapse of Lehman Brothers uncovered the real weaknesses – flushing away most of the wealth created in an unsustainable way. Throughout 2009, GDP fell by close to 14% in Estonia and Lithuania, and by an even more shattering 18% in Latvia.  
4 BIS Review 122/2010 Many suggested devaluation as the best solution to support economy and to solve old problems. However, that was clearly not an option for the Baltic countries given their openness, flexibility, large foreign-currency-denominated debt and long history of fixed exchange rate regimes serving as an anchor for macroeconomic stability for the Baltic States, and also Bulgaria. Already now Baltic performance has reassured many sceptics that the internal adjustment strategy simply works, making a good case for other countries to move forward with fiscal consolidation and much needed reforms. I mentioned the internal adjustment strategy – there was actually such strategy: the State Treasury was running out of funds and there is simply no other alternative.  The reform agenda in the Baltics has been ambitious. To ensure fiscal sustainability, the adjustment burden undertaken ranged from an estimated 9–10% of GDP in Lithuania and Estonia to 14% of GDP in Latvia throughout 2009–2010 – something that the world had not seen before. And yet we did not get stuck in a protracted recession as sceptics predicted. We have already reached a significant progress in regaining cost competitiveness, have made our economies structurally more resilient and are moving towards sustainable growth.   So far I have addressed the Baltics as a region rather than the individual economies that they are and therefore it might seem that developments there were rather similar. Despite the many similarities, however, there were also significant differences that are extremely important if one is to draw lessons from the recent crisis. One may also say that while all three being tigers – a metaphor commonly used to describe the past exceptionally strong expansion of the Baltic economies – each of the three had and still has its own – unique – character. One of the obvious differences among the Baltic countries was their policy stance in the run-up to crisis. Fiscal discipline differed considerably among the three countries throughout the boom years that largely shaped their performance during the crisis. 
BIS Review 122/2010 5  Latvia was clearly the most quick-tempered one on the fiscal front. Experiencing the fastest economic expansion and extremely strong cyclical upturn in tax revenue, we still managed to spend more than we earned and recorded a budget deficit every single year during the boom. While being rather moderate in nominal terms, the deficits were extremely large when cyclically adjusted – amounting to 7–8% of GDP, in turn adding extra fuel to the already severely overheated economy. Budgetary discipline was extremely weak. Every single year when revenue performance turned out better than expected, budget laws were amended to further boost expenditure. Between 2004 and 2008, expenditure picked up 2½ times, and most of that was of a structural nature. As many of you know – there was really one industry which was overheating – namely construction and nothing was done to prevent it. This meant an accumulation of an enormous fiscal gap – over 20% of GDP – that was temporarily obscured by the economic boom but became obvious with the burst of the bubble. As authorities rapidly ran out of available liquidity and no investors were ready to finance the massive fiscal needs, Latvia had to turn for international support, becoming a program country under the IMF Stand-By Arrangement and European Commission support. Lithuania was not materially better in terms of fiscal management, but was lucky to lag behind in terms of the economic cycle, which resulted in a less overheated economy before the crisis took off. Estonia, however, showed much more prudence in pursuing counter-cyclical policies accumulating considerable liquidity cushion to support economy during the downturn. Every single year since 2002 Estonia ran budget surpluses that increased over time as the economy accelerated. This made a significant difference in the way economies adjusted during the crisis with strong implications to their future growth prospects. While Latvia and Lithuania ended up with skyrocketing public debts, Estonia’s debt remained contained, allowing for a greater fiscal space and stronger growth potential in future. Already now Estonia has a faster GDP growth and its future looks much brighter. In other words – it is the combination of prudent fiscal and monetary policies which is behind the most notable difference with the other Baltic States. A by-product of Estonia’s persistent prudent policies or – should we say – a prize for its very top stands during last 10 years, that is also going to be its membership of the Euro area as early as 2011. 
6 BIS Review 122/2010  The euro is not a solution to all problems and it does not mean a automatic welfare gains for converging economies like ours, but if policies are kept on track, the euro helps boosting growth potential and provides vast opportunities for future development. While we have been struggling to simply stay afloat, Estonia has strategically moved towards its aim of joining the euro. I can only express a friendly envy regarding their pragmatism, strategic mindset and ability to move in unison to make use of synergies and reach common targets. “Yes We Can!” sounds like Estonia, and I would like to wish every success to the Estonian authorities in their future endeavours of making their country a better place to live and advance. What can we learn from Estonia? Our northern neighbour is a good example that any target can be reached, but this requires strategy and ambition. Latvia has shown that it can brace up and make hard but necessary steps forward when cornered. However, all determination tends to fade away with the situation becoming less pressing. When afloat we start drifting downstream instead of heading towards the river bank. I am afraid, as we hear, that Latvia has done a good job, that we are leaving the crisis behind us, there could be less motivation to continue the adjustment. Hopefully, this has been changed by the recent crisis. Latvia is gradually heeling its economic wounds and, hopefully, has learned the lesson that a county cannot live beyond its means without endangering its future prospects. To create a stable economy, which generates more prosperity, is clearly the target for the undertaken reform agenda in this country. In any case, we need another round of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to bring public finance on a sustainable footing and economy back on a sustainable growth track. At the moment, unsustainable public finance is significantly hampering lending activity, investment, economic activity and new jobs, reduction of the state debt. In other words – deficit can hamper future growth should this problem remain unsolved.  
BIS Review 122/2010 7  While the economic and financial situation in Latvia has improved significantly since the onset of the recent crisis, we are not out of the woods yet. According to our estimates another 400 million in expenditure cuts backed by structural reforms that make them permanent are needed to bring the recently high budget deficit towards a more comfortable level in 2011. The resulting budget deficit of 6% is not a magic number, though! Circumstances permitting, the deficit could be even smaller, provided Latvia with higher rating, lower interest rates, new investments and new jobs. This would also bring us much closer to the euro introduction in 2014 as an exit from the international support program. I am perfectly aware that this is not an easy task; however, it is realistic should we have a strategic mindset and enough ambition. In conclusion let me quote the Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilvess from what he said back in April 2009 during a meeting with his Latvian counterpart Valdis Zatlers: “In Estonia we know that tax revenue is lower than expected and additional steps are required. (..) At times when money runs out, there are no simple or pleasant solutions left – expenditures have to be cut. It is an illusion to think that we will be able to spend money, which we actually do not have. That is impossible – for individuals and states alike. Therefore – if one does not have the money to spend, expenditures have to be cut. The question then naturally is – where to cut. I believe that both Estonia and Latvia are clearly aware that it is fiscally responsible to make these complicated choices now and not dump these complicated choices on the future generations. Thank you for your attention! 
BIS Review 122/2010 1 Spencer Dale: Inflation, inflation, inflation Speech by Mr Spencer Dale, Executive Director and Chief Economist of the Bank of England, at Cardiff Business School, Cardiff, 22 September 2010. *      *      * I would like to thank Venetia Bell, Rohan Churm and Łukasz Rachel for their considerable help in preparing these remarks. The views expressed are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of other members of the Monetary Policy Committee. Introduction Thank you for the invitation to speak this evening. I studied for my undergraduate degree in economics at what was then University College Cardiff in the mid 1980s. I had three wonderful years in Cardiff and it is a huge pleasure to come back tonight and to see so many familiar faces. Although I hope some of those familiar faces will be kinder to my speech tonight than they were with my essays back then. The theme of my talk tonight is inflation. I hope that you won’t find that too disappointing. I fear that some of you were looking forward to a talk on more exciting topics like the financial crisis, the new responsibilities that have been granted to the Bank, the speculation concerning a double dip. But I make no apology for focussing on inflation. One of the cornerstones of our economy’s stable and consistent growth in the 15 years or so prior to the financial crisis was the period of low and stable inflation that was achieved then. And our future prosperity will depend on our maintaining an environment of low and stable inflation. One of the most worrying comments I have heard in recent months came at a lunch of senior businessmen I attended. One of the diners suggested that the UK was returning to its old ways “of depreciating the exchange rate and inflating its way out of trouble.” Soon after, a City circular asked “is the MPC turning a blind eye to inflation?” This is dangerous talk. The evils of inflation are well known. The high and volatile rates of inflation of the 1970s and 80s stunted our economic performance. Companies and households were unable to budget and plan efficiently. Resources were misallocated. Long-term contracts were avoided. The value of hard-earned savings was eroded. This dangerous talk has perhaps been partly fuelled by the behaviour of inflation in recent years. CPI inflation has averaged close to 3% over the past four years, significantly higher than the 2% target and for the most part higher than the MPC anticipated. CPI inflation has been above target for 41 out of the past 50 months. Lest we forget, this is a long, long way from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 80s. Even so, it is perhaps understandable that some may have started to question the commitment or competence of the Monetary Policy Committee. Has the MPC gone soft on inflation? Is this a conspiracy with the Government to deflate away some of its debt? The answer to both these questions is emphatically “No”. The MPC remains as committed as ever to meeting the inflation target. It is our job to achieve the target and we are accountable to Parliament for doing so. To borrow from a phrase of a previous Prime Minister, ask me my three main priorities for monetary policy and I will tell you: inflation, inflation, inflation. Maintaining low and stable inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the long-term health and prosperity of our economy. But I recognise that reassuring words and good intentions are not enough. We need to understand better the factors causing inflation to be above target. And we need to learn from 
2 BIS Review 122/2010 the upside surprises in inflation we have experienced recently. That is the topic of tonight’s talk.  I will argue that it is not difficult to explain the past strength of inflation. In fact there is a surplus of explanations. But there are important lessons to learn from the recent behaviour of inflation. And I will explain to you why – despite inflation being above target and expected to remain so until the end of next year and monetary policy being at unprecedented loose levels – the MPC has not gone soft on inflation. What determines inflation? To help structure the discussion, I want to frame my comments in terms of a simple model of pricing behaviour, in which companies are assumed to set prices as a mark-up over marginal costs. The precise details of the model are not important for tonight. Many of the mechanisms and channels that I will discuss are embodied within standard pricing models.1 More importantly, my experience of speaking to businesses since the financial crisis began suggests that this type of framework captures the key factors that have been important in determining their pricing decisions. In particular, this type of pricing model emphasises the role of four types of factors. First, the marginal cost of producing an additional unit of output, which is likely to depend on the degree of spare capacity. Spare capacity within firms – since it tends to be cheaper for a company to increase output if some of its employees and capital are not fully utilised. And spare capacity in the wider economy – as slack in the labour market will tend to limit wage growth and thus the cost pressures faced by companies. But many companies face other cost pressures that are not related to their own capacity constraints or the ease with which they can hire staff. These “other” costs are the second factor. Some of these costs relate to inputs that are imported, such as energy and other commodities, and so depend on movements in world prices and in the sterling exchange rate. Others stem from domestic factors, including – importantly in the current context – changes in indirect taxes.  The third factor emphasised by this type of pricing model is the mark-up over costs included in the final selling price which governs the return firms make on capital. As I will discuss later, there is some evidence to suggest that movements in this mark-up have been different in this recession than in previous ones. The final set of factors determining pricing decisions are expectations of future costs and prices. Most companies change prices infrequently and as such their pricing decisions today are based on expectations about how their costs and their competitors’ prices are likely to vary in the future. Similarly, pay awards are likely to be affected by firms’ and employees’ expectations of future inflation. I will use this broad framework to consider why inflation has been above the 2% target for much of the past four years and why inflation was higher than expected for much of this period.  Price level shocks It is not difficult to find factors that have pushed up inflation over the past few years. The economy has been hit by a series of large price level shocks – to oil and other commodity prices, to VAT and to the sterling exchange rate – which have raised companies’ costs and                                                  1  The key intuition of this model is based on work such as that by Marshall (1920), Chamberlin (1933),  Spence (1976) and Salop (1979), among many others who contributed to this now well established literature. 
BIS Review 122/2010 3 put upward pressure on prices. Together these factors can more than account for the strength of inflation. The impact of the rise in oil prices and the changes to VAT have been discussed quite extensively elsewhere and so I will not expand on them further this evening.2 However, it is perhaps worth spending a few minutes considering the effects that the substantial depreciation of sterling has had on companies’ costs and prices. Sterling has depreciated by close to 25% since mid-2007. To get a sense of the potential impact this depreciation may have had on inflation, it is worth recalling that imported goods and services account for around a quarter of the consumer price basket. So a simple thought experiment in which import costs increased in line with the fall in the value of sterling and these increased costs were fully passed-through into retail prices would imply an increase in the price level of around 6 percentage points. Now there are many reasons why this simple thought experiment is likely to be misleading. But it does serve to emphasise the potential size of the effect associated with sterling’s depreciation and how different judgments concerning its impact could have very different implications for inflation. It was difficult to judge in advance the extent to which sterling’s depreciation was likely to feed through into consumer prices. In part, that was because this was the first example of a large exchange rate depreciation since the UK had started inflation targeting. This matters because the size and nature of pass-through is likely to depend on the monetary policy regime. Moreover, pass-through from changes in the exchange rate to import prices, and then to consumer prices, has varied considerably over time. As my fellow MPC member Adam Posen pointed out recently, a range of studies suggest that exchange rate pass-through declined during the period of Great Stability (Posen 2010). Even ex post, the impact of the depreciation on consumer prices is hard to assess. The peak impact of the exchange rate depreciation on CPI inflation was probably somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 percentage points. While the scale of the total pass-through to retail price inflation appears broadly similar to past experience, companies seem to have passed through increases in import cost more quickly than in the recent past.3 That quicker pass-through is likely to help explain why inflation over the past year or so has been higher than the MPC had anticipated.  What evidence is this based on? The production of goods (excluding energy) tends to be more import-intensive than that of services, so the relative trends in goods and services price inflation can help to assess the impact of the depreciation on consumer prices. Between 1997 and 2008, annual non-energy industrial goods price inflation averaged around 6 percentage points lower than services price inflation. But that wedge closed during 2009, as non-energy industrial goods price inflation soared and services price inflation fell to below its historical average (Chart 1). Moreover, the relatively close co-movement between finished manufactured goods import prices and consumer goods prices (excluding energy and food) over the past two years is suggestive of relatively high and rapid pass-through (Chart 2). The faster adjustment of prices relative to that implied by the evidence from the Great Stability may partly reflect the fact that much of that evidence for the UK is based on the                                                  2  For example, see Section 4 and the box on pages 48-49 of the August 2010 Inflation Report, Fisher (2010) and Sentance (2009). 3  Much of the recent analysis of exchange rate pass-through is based on evidence taken from the Great Stability period (see for example Campa and Goldberg (2006) and Ihrig, Marazzi and Rothenberg (2006)). The results from these studies pick up the average lag structure of the past, and are sensitive to the window in which exchange rate effects are identified. It may be that the lag structure following sterling’s depreciation was quicker. To the extent that businesses adjusted more quickly, pass-through in the current period might appear larger than suggested by the econometric techniques used in previous studies, when in fact the adjustment was only faster. 
4 BIS Review 122/2010 behaviour of prices following sterling’s appreciation in 1996. It is quite possible that those businesses whose margins were squeezed following the recent exchange rate depreciation responded more quickly than they did to the increase in margins associated with the mid-1990s appreciation.  My central view is that the peak impact of the past depreciation on inflation has probably passed – monthly goods price inflation has slowed in recent quarters and the total adjustment in relative prices is similar to previous exchange rate changes. But there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this judgment and it is quite possible that there may be further significant upward pressure on prices to come. The increase in prices associated with the combination of the rise in oil prices, the changes to VAT, and the past depreciation of sterling is more than sufficient to explain the strength of inflation relative to target. Moreover, the fact that some of these factors were not predictable in advance and that their implications for inflation – particularly so in the case of the exchange rate – appear to have been greater than initially anticipated, can also help to account for the upside surprises in inflation. But the exact contribution from these price-level shocks is uncertain and it is possible that the other factors identified by the pricing framework also contributed to the surprising strength of inflation. The impact of spare capacity on costs and prices Consider first the impact of spare capacity on costs and prices.  There are good reasons to believe that a substantial margin of spare capacity opened up during the recession and remains today. Output fell precipitously through the second half of 2008 and into 2009 and, despite the recovery in recent quarters, the level of output remains around 10% below that implied by a continuation of its pre-recession trend. The precise degree of spare capacity is difficult to judge since it depends on the extent to which the recession damaged the supply potential of our economy.4 Some of the channels through which recessions in the past have impeded supply growth appear, thus far at least, to have been less damaging than we initially feared. Despite a larger fall in output, the fall in employment, although substantial, has been less than in past recessions. Likewise, the pickup in company liquidations has been relatively muted. It is likely that the financial crisis and the reduced availability of credit have affected supply in other ways, such as making it harder for smaller or more entrepreneurial companies to raise funds for investment or expansion. But even so, demand has probably weakened by substantially more than potential supply, implying a large degree of slack both in the labour market and within companies. Consider each in turn. Slack in the labour market has contributed to the muted growth in earnings seen over the past 18 months or so. Annual private sector earnings growth has averaged a little below 1 1/2 % since the start of the recession, around a third of its rate in the five preceding years. But the impact of this weak pay on companies’ costs has been offset by businesses appearing to hold onto more staff than warranted by the lower level of output. The corollary of the resilience in employment has been a sharp drop in labour productivity. As a result, growth in labour costs per unit of output has remained relatively firm, although it has fallen back as productivity has begun to recover.  Companies that have spare capacity within their business should be able to use these underutilised resources to increase output relatively cheaply. As such, spare capacity within                                                  4  See Benito et al (2010) for a discussion of the impact of the financial crisis on supply. 
BIS Review 122/2010 5 companies should, at the margin, push down costs and prices. But reports from our network of Agents suggest that some companies responded to the sharp fall in output by temporarily decommissioning some of their capacity in order to reduce their cost base.5 Companies mothballed production lines; cut back on capital leases; reduced the number of shifts and so on.  Although it is perhaps most natural to think of this mothballing behaviour in the context of manufacturing, it was also apparent within the services sector. It was relatively commonplace for professional services companies to encourage staff to take sabbaticals at much reduced pay. Aircraft were taken out of service. Shops were left empty. This type of adjustment has helped UK industry to withstand the effect of the recession. It reduces companies’ average costs and so protects their profitability during the period of weak demand. A by-product of this adjustment, however, is that the marginal cost of producing additional output is higher. Although the mothballed capacity can be reinstated, it is likely to be more costly to do so, especially in the short-run, than if the resources were simply standing idle. Assembly lines need to be serviced before being restarted; staff need to be brought back from sabbaticals. As a result, the downward pressure on costs and prices stemming from the latent spare capacity within companies, at least in the near term, is likely to be less.6 Developments in margins Consider next the mark-up over and above costs that companies include in their selling price.  In the past, margins in the UK have tended to fall back during periods of weak demand and vice versa.7 One possible reason for this is if companies reduce their prices relative to their costs when demand is weak in order to gain market share which they hope to hold onto as demand increases, ie they hope to be able to exploit some degree of pricing power. If successful, the lower profits in the downturn are outweighed by the gains during the upswing. This pro-cyclicality of margins is another reason why inflation in the UK has tended to moderate during periods of weak demand.  But margins appear to have fallen by less during the recent recession than expected given the marked contraction in demand. Simple measures of margins, such as the profit share, have been relatively resilient. And a recent survey by the Bank’s Agents suggested that margins on average were only a little below normal, despite the marked contraction in demand.8 Why so? In part, aggregate margins may have been boosted by the sharp rise in sterling export prices following the depreciation of sterling. The increase in exporters’ margins may well have masked a decline in margins earned by domestic producers.                                                  5  That is consistent with some surveys of companies’ capacity utilisation, which do not seem to have fallen by as much as the fall in output might suggest. 6  An important issue determining the evolution of supply in the medium-term is how quickly this mothballed capacity is either brought back on stream or eroded. This is likely to depend on the pace of the recovery. 7  Strictly, the model I am discussing talks about the mark-up over marginal cost, whereas margins are calculated with reference to average costs. Margins have the advantage that they can be calculated from companies’ published accounts, wheras mark-ups are not directly observable. But different estimates of the mark-up in the United Kingdom have appeared to move in a similar direction to margins across economic cycles. See Haskel et al (1995) and Macallan and Parker (2008). 8  See the box on page 5 of the July 2010 Agents’ summary of business conditions, available at: http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/agentssummary/agsum10jul.pdf 
6 BIS Review 122/2010 But it may also reflect the nature of this recession. Speak to almost any businessperson and they will tell you the same story: to be successful, businesses need healthy cash flow. Cash is king. That has always been the case. But one consequence of the financial crisis – as the availability of bank financed tightened and trade credit dried up – is that the importance placed on maintaining cash flows increased. Companies were less able to trade-off lower selling prices today for future gains in market share.9 Inflation expectations The final factor emphasised by the pricing model is inflation expectations.  The importance of inflation expectations is well understood. If wage and price setters expect the MPC to keep inflation close to target for much of the time, this will be reflected in their behaviour which, in turn, will help keep inflation close to target. Successful policy and anchored inflation expectations are self-reinforcing. A significant risk associated with the recent period of above-target inflation is that it causes inflation expectations to become less well anchored. The dangerous talk may start to be believed. If so, temporary deviations in inflation would tend to be given greater weight in wage and price setting and so become more persistent. And the task of monetary policy would become substantially harder. Although this remains a significant risk, my reading of the available evidence to date is that inflation expectations remain relatively well anchored. Measures of households’ short-term expectations have picked up over the past year or so, but so have the MPC’s projections for nearterm inflation. Indeed, the MPC’s own revisions to its central inflation projection over the past year have been similar to that implied by a majority of survey measures (Chart 3). And measures of households’ medium-term inflation expectations have remained broadly stable, as have expectations of professional forecasters. Indeed, the surprising strength in inflation during the recession may partly stem from inflation expectations being more firmly anchored than in the past, so helping to offset the downward pressure from spare capacity. This may reflect the different role played by monetary policy in this recession from that in the 1980s and 1990s. In those earlier recessions, policy was designed to reduce trend inflation. As such, expectations about future policy and the emerging spare capacity reinforced each other in bearing down on prices. In contrast, the aim of monetary policy during this recession has been to work against the downward pressure on inflation from excess capacity in order to avoid a prolonged period of below-target inflation. Where does all this leave us? To my mind, there is no great puzzle or mystery surrounding the period of above-target inflation seen over the past few years. Our economy has been affected by a number of large shocks – to energy prices, the level of VAT, and the value of sterling – which have caused prices to increase. Some of these shocks were not predictable in advance. And even if they were, trying to use monetary policy to offset short-run movements in inflation is likely to have amplified output volatility.                                                  9  Another defining feature of this recession is that it has been very deep. If companies are already down to their core customer base, cutting prices may generate little additional demand. Put more formally, as output fell, the demand curve faced by some companies may have become increasingly inelastic, thus reducing their incentive to cut their margins. See Bils (1989) and Ravn et al (2006) for examples of pricing models that incorporate such customer behaviour. 
BIS Review 122/2010 7 But that does not mean that we should not learn from the behaviour of inflation. My current assessment is that changes in the structure of the economy, the nature of the financial crisis, and the different role played by policy all affected the behaviour of inflation during the downturn. And it is important that we learn from those developments to help set policy in the future.  Conclusion So what are the implications for policy? Surely with inflation above target and expected to remain so for some time, the natural thing is to begin to reduce the degree of monetary stimulus? Monetary policy is extraordinarily loose and a small tightening would still leave policy hugely stimulatory. And what better way to counter the dangerous talk than by putting our money where our mouth is and beginning to withdraw the policy stimulus. But it is not as straightforward as that – there are significant risks to both sides of the inflation outlook. Yes: the period of above target inflation; the fact that inflation has been higher than expected; and that it is likely to remain above target until the end of next year all contribute to the risk that credibility and confidence in the MPC may start to waver. If that were to happen, and wage and price setters started to expect higher inflation to persist, the task facing the MPC in returning our economy to an environment of low and stable inflation would be substantially greater. Don’t forget the repeated and costly failures of the 1970s and 80s. We lose our credibility at our peril – once the genie of inflation credibility escapes it is costly to put back. The response to a possible loss of credibility is clear – monetary policy would need to tighten, possibly aggressively so. But I think this risk remains just that – a risk. Despite the dangerous talk, most measures of inflation expectations still appear broadly consistent with hitting the inflation target in the medium term.  And there are significant downside risks to inflation. It is difficult to know exactly how much spare capacity there is in the economy and what its precise impact is on inflation. But that there remains some slack in the economy and this is likely to be pushing down on costs and prices seems clear. That impact should become more apparent as the temporary effects associated with the shocks to input prices and VAT wane. It is perhaps noteworthy that in the US and euro area, which have not experienced falls in their exchange rates or large movements in indirect taxes, core inflation has weakened substantially. The downside risks to the growth outlook, stemming in particular from the substantial fiscal consolidation now in train and the continuing constraints on the supply of bank lending, add materially to the downside risks to inflation. And even if the economic recovery does continue, it is possible that some of the factors that may have contributed to the surprising strength in inflation in the past may start to fade. As demand increases, companies may begin to bring mothballed capacity back on stream. And as firms build up their cash balances and credit becomes more available, margins may start to fall as companies seek to enter new markets and gain new customers. The risks to the inflation target are real and substantial. The job of monetary policy is to try to balance these upside and downside risks to inflation. In essence this is no different to normal, monetary policy is always faced with a balancing act. But what is different is that the current risks to inflation are unusually large. My central view is that these risks should gradually lessen as the temporary effects pushing up on inflation wane and the economic recovery continues. But it is possible that some of the risks will crystallise and policy will need to react. It is quite likely that in hindsight, once we see how the economy evolved and which risks materialised, that the current stance of policy will be criticised for having been too tight or too 
8 BIS Review 122/2010 loose. But we cannot set policy with hindsight. All we can do is set policy in such a way that balances the opposing risks to inflation and be ready to change policy decisively in either direction as this balance of risks alters. I do not know when policy will next change or in what direction. But I can assure you that when making this decision, the objectives of policy will be clear and unchanging: inflation, inflation, inflation.

BIS Review 121/2010 1 Thomas J Jordan: A changing role for central banks? Speech by Mr Thomas J Jordan, Vice Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Welcome Event Master of Banking and Finance, St. Gallen, 22 September 2010. *      *      * I would like to thank Dr. Claudia Strub and Till Ebner for their valuable support in drafting this speech. Introduction The economic cost of financial crises is enormous. The recent crisis highlighted the extent of systemic risk and thus the overriding importance of a stable financial system. It also demonstrated the inadequacy of the instruments and measures used until now to ensure financial stability. More effective measures are needed to check and prevent systemic risk. The key question is how should – or can – this be achieved in the future? In my talk today I would like to address this question by focusing on the role of central banks. Specifically, I will endeavour to answer the following question: To what extent will the lessons learned from this crisis affect or even alter the future role and tasks of central banks? I intend to examine this from three perspectives: In the first part of my talk, I will examine the extent to which central banks need to undertake a fundamental review of their instruments and objectives in the light of recent events. In particular, there is a need to analyse the effectiveness of the monetary policy strategies and instruments used to date, especially in periods of crisis. In my view, monetary policy measures and instruments alone are inadequate for the task of effectively checking and preventing systemic crises. In the second part of my talk, I shall therefore focus on the regulatory response to deal with potential instabilities within the financial system. One possible response to the inadequacies highlighted by the crisis would be to strengthen macroprudential supervision and regulation. In this case, the interaction between these measures and monetary policy would have to be borne in mind. Thirdly, institutional aspects play a key role in the restructuring of the regulatory environment. I will outline these briefly in the final part of my talk. Monetary policy after the crisis Let me start by reviewing the objectives and instruments of central banks in the light of recent events. Comparing today’s world with the situation a few decades ago, it becomes evident that much has changed. Deregulation of the financial markets has increased and globalisation has progressed extremely fast – in the real economy as well. The brisk level of trading made a significant contribution to the long-lasting worldwide upswing in recent years. This was supported by the credible policies pursued by central banks, which increasingly prioritised the goal of price stability, thus contributing to a global reduction in the level and volatility of inflation. The battle against high inflation appeared to have been won. Overall, this led to firm expectations of low inflation and a dramatic drop in risk premia in virtually all areas of the financial markets. However, the successful battle against inflation and the related reduction in macroeconomic volatility – also known as the “Great Moderation” – were not able to prevent serious instabilities within the globalised financial system. Alongside its evident benefits, the “Great Moderation” thus seems to have produced a number of damaging by-products. In combination with low real interest rates, financial 
2 BIS Review 121/2010 innovations and liberalised capital markets provided enormous credit-creation potential. Together with a reduced perception of risk, this fostered a rapid rise in asset prices which ultimately led to excesses and imbalances in some markets. Through contagion effects, the bursting of a credit and asset price bubble can bring the entire global financial system to the brink of collapse within a very short period of time. In view of the interaction with the real economy, this also has serious implications for the world economy and global growth. This raises a number of questions about the future role of central banks. Can and should monetary policy be used to actively counter the development of imbalances or financial bubbles? Does it make sense to use monetary policy instruments for this? Will the new instruments used during the crisis also play a more important role in monetary policy in the future? To answer these questions, I would like to look specifically at two aspects. First, I will examine the measures used by central banks during the crisis and briefly outline the possibilities and limitations on their future use in monetary policy. Then I will consider whether monetary policy should step up its focus on the goal of financial stability. With regard to measures taken during the crisis, I can say straight away that the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments was clearly demonstrated. We were able to safeguard price stability and cushion the negative impact on the real economy. However, vigorous interest rate cuts were not sufficient on their own – neither in Switzerland nor in other countries. The liquidity situation on the money markets initially remained extremely tense. In many cases, interest rates rapidly dropped to zero. The chief monetary policy instrument could thus no longer be used. Central banks around the world therefore adopted so-called unconventional measures. These included direct intervention in the financial markets by buying assets, such as long-dated government bonds, debt securities issued by private borrowers and foreign exchange. Another measure was the temporary expansion of liquidity provision to banks beyond the “normal” level – for example, through repo transactions with unusually long maturities of up to one year. These measures were taken for two reasons. First, they permit further monetary easing if the desired stabilisation of prices and the economy cannot be achieved through cutting interest rates alone. Second, unconventional measures can be justified by the central banks’ role as lender of last resort. Its role, in other words, of providing emergency funding for financial institutions that are facing short-term liquidity bottlenecks. The aim of these unconventional measures is to restore the functioning of market forces as quickly as possible and ultimately to restore market confidence in the financial system. Two main lessons can be learnt from the vigorous response by central banks. It showed that zero interest rates on no account mean that central banks have exhausted their set of monetary policy instruments. Through quantitative and credit easing measures, the central banks have effective instruments that can be used to reduce risk premia, alleviate liquidity bottlenecks and prevent deflation. Moreover, their role as lender of last resort has taken on a new dimension. Previously, this role was confined to providing funds to bridge temporary liquidity bottlenecks at a particular bank. At the height of the crisis, however, the priority was to secure the liquidity of entire markets. The central banks demonstrated that they can fulfil this function to a previously unforeseen extent. In short, they demonstrated their ability to respond to a systemic crisis. Nevertheless, we need to be cautious when considering whether such measures should be included in a central bank’s conventional set of instruments in the future. These unconventional measures proved useful for direct crisis management. However, so far we have little practical experience of monetary policy management at zero interest rates, especially over a prolonged period of time. It is clear that the instruments used come at a price. In the longer term, for instance, they could create new instabilities and distortions on the financial markets. Similarly, such an enormous increase in liquidity could lead to a build-up of significant inflationary potential. So it is too early to conclusively assess the impact of the measures taken. In general, though, they should be reserved principally for crisis management. Looking beyond the reactive crisis management, the aftermath of the 
BIS Review 121/2010 3 crisis has brought an old question back into the limelight: To what extent should central banks proactively hinder the development of imbalances on the financial markets, rather than simply adopting an ex post “mopping up” role. More specifically: should central banks try to counter market excesses by steering interest rates in order to prevent a potential collapse of the financial system and the resultant costly implications for the real economy? This is a complex issue and answering it would go well beyond the scope of this talk. However, it is very topical and tends to recur constantly in the public policy debate. I would therefore like to give you my view on this issue. For a long time now, central bankers and economists have been examining the extent to which changes in asset prices should be taken into account in monetary policy. For example, this could mean that the central bank would raise interest rates if there was a risk that an emerging credit bubble could destabilise the system. The debate is fraught with difficulties, and though it started some time ago, research is still in its infancy. I will therefore merely outline the possible problems and challenges that could arise. To make my position clear: I am convinced that a strategy geared to medium and long-term price stability is vital for effective implementation of monetary policy. After all, the economic benefits of stable prices are undisputed. High and volatile inflation rates are detrimental to productivity and growth. Uncertainty about future price trends leads to inefficient investment and consumer spending decisions. That does not mean, however, that financial stability should be ignored completely in monetary policy considerations. Nevertheless, taking greater account of financial imbalances presents a number of practical difficulties. An initial problem is that a single instrument – namely the interest rate – would be expected to achieve two objectives simultaneously: price stability and financial stability. That does not seem to be a problem at first sight, because usually the two support each other, especially when taking a long-term view. Credible action to ensure price stability fosters a sense of security and market confidence, which in turn play a key role in ensuring financial stability. Similarly, a stable financial system is a key prerequisite for price stability. The recent financial crisis provided impressive negative evidence to confirm this rule. The bursting of a financial bubble can easily trigger a deflationary trend. So far, so good. However, a second glance reveals potential conflicts between these two objectives in certain situations. For example, a positive supply shock – as a result of technological progress, for instance – could keep inflationary pressure low for a prolonged period. Expansionary monetary policy conditions could therefore be maintained. But if we look at financial stability, this situation entails the risk of a boom-bust cycle, which would require a tightening of monetary policy. A similar problem is conceivable if the economic outlook is so poor that raising interest rates would be inappropriate because of the risk of deflation. However, maintaining low interest rates would pave the way for potential imbalances, which – from the point of view of financial stability – would actually have to be countered by raising interest rates. Such situations make it clear that a single instrument cannot simultaneously achieve two objectives. A further problem is that a bubble is not easy to identify. Expecting us to be able to tell in advance whether damaging price imbalances are building up within certain asset classes is not realistic. First, that would require us to be better than market forces in assessing the fundamentally justified value of a specific asset. Second, it is not easy to clearly identify which variables are to be used as indicators of imbalances. A third problem is that we do not yet have any sound knowledge of the timing, effectiveness and required scope of the monetary policy response that would be necessary to counter financial imbalances. Since asset prices are typically far more volatile than real economic variables and general price levels, substantial changes in interest rates could be required to check financial imbalances, and this could have serious side-effects on the goal of maintaining price stability. 
4 BIS Review 121/2010 As you can see, there are many questions that have not yet been clarified. The problems I have mentioned make it clear that central banks would rapidly reach their limits if they were simply to add a further goal alongside price stability without new instruments to deal with it. The more objectives an instrument is expected to achieve, the greater the risk of wrong decisions and conflicting objectives. However, as I have already said, these problems do not mean that financial stability should be ignored completely in monetary policy decisions. Asset prices and other variables such as credit growth must be included as indicators when assessing the situation and the outlook for inflation. They are already included in the practical implementation of today’s monetary policy strategy. Yet care must be taken when interpreting such “instability variables” because they provide only limited information about future economic trends. To sum up, monetary policy can make an important contribution to financial stability. However, the set of monetary policy instruments is unsuitable for excluding all imbalances in all circumstances. Accordingly, instruments that have a direct effect are needed to counter the emergence of (global) financial instabilities. A key lesson of the crisis is that there is scope to strengthen what is known as macroprudential supervision and regulation. This should be seen as complementary to monetary policy, to aid attainment of the twin goals of price stability and financial stability. Allow me to explain this in more detail. A framework for macroprudential supervision and regulation Put simply, macroprudential supervision and regulation is concerned with the stability of the entire financial system, rather than that of individual institutions, which is the domain of microprudential supervision and regulation. Macroprudential supervision and regulation involves examining systemic risks that arise from the interaction between individual banks or the risk that the default of a single bank – because of its size or market share – could jeopardise certain functions that are vital for the economy, such as payment transactions or lending business. For example, one solution that could significantly reduce such problems would be progressive capital adequacy requirements. In other words, the greater a bank’s systemic importance, the more equity it would be required to hold. If capital adequacy requirements rise in step with systemic importance, banks have an incentive to stay smaller and thus less systemically important. Capital reserves for systemically important banks in excess of a minimum level could also act as a kind of “automatic stabiliser”. Reserves built up in “good times” allow banks to absorb losses in “bad times” without having to cease normal business operations. Another central aspect of macroprudential supervision and regulation takes account of the build-up of systemic risks over time, and especially the procyclical effects in the financial sector. Discretionary action could be taken to cushion the growth of such risks over time – for instance, by imposing an obligation to build up additional capital in phases of excessive credit growth, in other words a countercyclical capital buffer. A key aspect here is that such measures help prevent possible imbalances within the financial system. Another way of achieving the required countercyclical effect is, for example, imposing direct restrictions on loan-to-value ratios if there are signs that a bubble could be forming in certain markets, such as the mortgage market. The difficulties of applying macroprudential supervision and regulation should not be underestimated, however. First and foremost, experience of discretionary instruments is still fairly limited. For example, there is not yet any conclusive research showing which indicators could be used to reliably identify systemic risks. Moreover, it is not easy to assess the point beyond which credit growth should be regarded as excessive. Furthermore, the interaction between macroprudential and monetary policy instruments could make implementation more difficult. In particular, monetary policy transmission channels could be affected. The impact of a change in interest rates on lending could vary depending on the level of a bank’s capital buffer. Therefore, in order to develop reliable indicators for systemic risk, to analyse the 
BIS Review 121/2010 5 interaction and feedback between macroprudential and monetary policy instruments, and to carefully evaluate the effective measures, we need clear mandates, enough time and additional expertise. So what is the role of central banks in establishing such a macroprudential framework? Generally speaking, the traditional tasks of central banks are closely linked to various aspects of systemic stability. A stable financial system is very important for the effective implementation of monetary policy. But also in active crisis management, central banks bear a major responsibility, as the recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated. The contribution of central banks is therefore of great relevance in the analysis and regulation of systemic risk. In particular, central banks will have a key role to play in macroprudential supervision and regulation for the following reasons: Developing and structuring macroprudential measures requires reliable analytical and forecasting skills – for instance, with regard to the overall economy or specific market segments, such as real estate. Central banks have extensive and soundly based knowledge of these fields. Moreover – as I have already pointed out – macroprudential policy interacts closely with monetary policy. This implies that the information advantage of central banks could be important in shaping macroprudential measures. Central banks will therefore almost certainly have to play a major role in implementing such instruments. At the same time, the risks involved in overemphasising the role of central banks in connection with such supervision and regulation also have to be borne in mind. Central banks could find themselves facing increased political pressure that could jeopardise their independence. If their credibility with regard to maintaining price stability were undermined, this could have devastating implications for the effective implementation of monetary policy. Institutional aspects And now, in the final part of my speech, I would like to look at some institutional aspects. To allow a more detailed analysis of systemic risks and how to keep them in check, we need a macroprudential framework in which various instruments can be combined to optimal effect. What is the best way of achieving this? Firstly, it is essential to recognise that ensuring financial stability as a whole is generally dependent on the decisions made by a range of different bodies. These need to act together in order to ensure financial stability. To create the necessary basis for a functioning macroprudential framework, the exact institutional set-up of the regulatory authorities is of the utmost importance. First and foremost, objectives, mandates and responsibilities need to be clearly defined. In Switzerland, for instance, FINMA – the Financial Market Supervisory Authority – is responsible for the regulation and supervision of individual banks. The SNB, on the other hand, is required to contribute to financial stability. With regard to Switzerland’s two big banks, there is a clear overlap between institutional and systemic risks. In this context, an exact definition of the responsibilities of the SNB and FINMA is of central importance for optimal macroprudential supervision and regulation. The revised Memorandum of Understanding between the SNB and FINMA is an important step in this direction. Secondly, to ensure that the institutions involved can optimally carry out the roles assigned to them, it is also important to give them the right tools. In concrete terms, this means that the SNB would, for example, need to have more extensive information about the stability of financial institutions – regarding their risk exposure, interdependences, etc. – or it would require specific instruments enabling it to take the right decisions when implementing macroprudential policy. Thirdly, the crisis made it clear that closer international cooperation between regulatory authorities is vital. Functioning international coordination mechanisms are required to counter future crises earlier and more effectively. International cooperation is the only way to check undesirable developments on the globalised financial markets. 
6 BIS Review 121/2010 Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the stable economic growth and low inflation of the last two decades could not prevent the emergence of vast imbalances in the global financial system, as the financial and economic crisis clearly showed. Such massive economic shocks are bound to have an impact on how central banks work. Nevertheless, ensuring price stability remains our top priority. The crisis made it evident that central banks have an effective set of instruments that can be used to mitigate the negative impact of financial crises. The unconventional measures used in this regard also proved to be effective. Yet despite these measures, the cost of the crisis remains enormous. One central conclusion, therefore, is that more attention needs to be paid to crisis prevention in order to improve the stability of financial systems. However, monetary policy instruments are only suitable up to a point in countering the emergence of financial imbalances. Hence, a different approach is needed. Strengthening macroprudential supervision and regulation is one plausible option. Macroprudential policy takes account of systemic risks in the financial sector through action geared to reducing such risks. As yet, however, we have little experience of this type of supervision and regulation. It is therefore vital that we act prudently and gradually when implementing any new measures, and that we give ourselves adequate time. The first step is to define clear and realistic mandates and objectives and to evaluate possible instruments. Collaboration between the various authorities involved – both nationally and internationally – is also of crucial importance. Overall, we need to create conditions that allow the timely application of suitable instruments to counter emergent financial instabilities. These instruments would essentially supplement our set of existing monetary policy instruments. Within such a framework, the SNB would be able to make an optimum contribution to both objectives – price stability and financial stability. 
BIS Review 121/2010 1 Heng Swee Keat: Achieving good regulatory outcomes – the way forward Welcome speech by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the 16th International Conference of Banking Supervisors, Singapore, 22 September 2010.  *      *      * 1. Good morning. My colleagues and I at the Monetary Authority of Singapore are delighted to welcome you to Singapore, and to the 16th International Conference of Banking Supervisors (ICBS). We are honoured to join the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as organisers of the conference.  Looking back on the crisis  2. When we last met in Brussels in September 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered a tail-spin in the global financial system. The global economic outlook was then grim. Decisive policy action has averted the worst scenarios of the crises, and the overall situation has improved significantly. Still, financial vulnerabilities and uncertainty over the pace of global economic recovery remain.  3. This year’s ICBS comes at a critical juncture. In the last two years, all of us, as national financial authorities, have undertaken extensive reviews to enhance the resilience of our financial systems. Globally, the FSB and IMF have been working to forge agreement on measures to prevent and mitigate a crisis of such systemic proportions. In particular, the Basel Committee under the leadership of Governor Nout Wellink has been at the forefront of devising a new regulatory framework that underpins and fosters a more resilient global banking system.  4. By bringing together senior officials from central banks and supervisory agencies from over 100 countries, this year’s meeting will provide the platform for us to move ahead on the core of the regulatory changes, and to chart the direction for the remaining areas of work.  5. The two themes for this year’s conference – building a more resilient banking system, and creating a stable financial environment for sustained economic growth underscore two key principles. First, the financial system needs to be resilient to avoid destabilizing the economy. Second, beyond resilience, rebuilding the nexus between the financial sector and the real sector is critical to supporting growth and development. This is particularly important in many emerging economies where the pace of financial sector development has not caught up with that of the real economy.  6. Let me now share some reflections on three themes that permeate discussion on financial resilience – microprudential regulations, macroprudential regulations, and supervisory approach.  The Basel Committee’s reforms  7. Many banks entered the crisis with too much leverage, too little capital and inadequate liquidity buffers. We need better micro-prudential regulations. Banks need to reduce leverage, have higher quality and quantity of capital to absorb losses, and maintain a higher proportion of liquid assets to withstand shocks in the funding markets.  8. The Basel Committee has agreed on the need for standards relating to capital, liquidity and leverage. These first set of parameters for core capital has been carefully calibrated after considering the conditions in the various economies, as well as the results of 
2 BIS Review 121/2010 the bottom-up Quantitative Impact Studies and the top-down macroeconomic impact of the proposed changes. The phase-in arrangement for the new benchmarks strikes an important balance between strengthening the financial system and supporting economic recovery. Singapore supports the Basel Committee’s reforms, and the further work to be done.  9. Going forward, our key challenge is to ensure robust implementation of these new capital standards. In an interconnected global system, major problems in one part of the system will eventually affect us directly or indirectly, through various channels. All economies, whether advanced or emerging, and whether they had a direct banking crisis or not, have therefore a shared interest in strengthening the resilience of the global financial system.  10. However, as we phase-in these measures, we need to be vigilant that these do not have unintended consequences on credit availability and economic growth, or in reducing diversity in the financial system.  11. In striving towards a convergence in regulatory standards in order to preserve a level playing field across jurisdictions, we should be cognizant that the starting conditions and future challenges of countries differ. For many emerging economies, their priority lies not in re-capitalising banks or reducing leverage, but in continuing the reform of the banking system and in developing deeper capital markets to support future economic expansion. Moreover, banks in emerging markets vary in size, sophistication and systemic significance – some are small and domestically focused, while others have sizeable regional footprints. Most emerging economies are also hosts to global banks, and rely on them to provide trade and project finance, and cross border remittances. Let me emphasise that these differences do not detract from the need to have higher regulatory standards. However, it does mean that in calibrating the details of the rules, we have to take into account these differences, so that financial intermediation is not adversely affected.  The Macroprudential dimension  12. Let me now say a few words about macroprudential regulations. Macroprudential regulations relate to the use of prudential tools to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole, and not just that of individual institutions. It recognizes that there are two sources of systemic risks. One, at any point in time, interlinkages and common exposures across institutions can multiply aggregate risks. Two, over time, boom/bust cycles can be amplified and destabilize the entire system. In good times, low volatility and low risk premia induce excessive credit creation and rising asset prices in a process which then feeds on itself. When confidence turns, the credit excesses and asset bubbles unwind quickly, with prices overshooting as they head down, feeding a downward spiral.  13. While macroprudential regulation is not new, the financial crisis has triggered a renewed interest in it. Various ideas are being explored – such as systemic surcharges and counter-cyclical capital buffers, and the viability of a more structured and rule-based framework for such measures. We should certainly explore new approaches and better tools. But let me make a few points on this.  14. First, unlike monetary policy, research on macroprudential tools of a more structured, rules-based nature is at an early stage. There are no simple targets like an inflation target, or clear measures of success built on detailed analysis of a long data series, since tail risks do not, by definition, materalise frequently. This makes the task inherently harder. Nor are there many rule-based tools that have proven their efficacy at the global level. Much more analytical work is needed.  15. Second, we now have a better understanding that the systemic risk posed by a bank depends on its size, interconnectedness and substitutability. It does not come from just “too-big-to-fail”, though sometimes these terms are used interchangeably. Many small banks 
BIS Review 121/2010 3 pursuing similar business models can build up large correlated positions. There can be systemic impact if these banks unwind their positions at the same time.  16. In the coming years, we will be focusing on some new tools such as countercyclical capital. Their effectiveness will need to be assessed over time, and against other options. We need to agree on the right set of policy tools to deal with systemic risks with the least unintended consequences.  17. The test of resilience of a bank or a system lies in its ability to absorb losses when a shock occurs – that is, its loss absorption capacity. For an individual bank, various tools, apart from surcharges or levies, should be considered. At the system level, adopting similar rules across institutions to prevent regulatory arbitrage should not inadvertently reduce the diversity in the global financial system. A variety of business models and investors with different risk appetites and liability-matching requirements may make for a more resilient system.  18. In the same vein, national regulators should explore a variety of approaches that are best suited to their conditions. Indeed, many emerging economies have banks that are systemic only in their local context, and national regulators need to consider how best to deal with these, even as we work together on global banks of systemic significance.  19. Third, post financial crisis, there is an understandable distrust of markets and supervisory judgment, and a preference to “hard-wire” most measures under Pillar 1 on capital. But we must not swing too far. Supervisors need to regain confidence and be prepared to exercise supervisory judgment – many economies have used macroprudential tools with some success by applying discretion. There is also scope for greater disclosure and market discipline under Pillar 3. Indeed, in the proposals relating to contingent capital – whether convertible bonds or bail-in arrangements, an understanding of the market dynamics relating to these instruments is crucial to their success.  20. Fourth, a sophisticated approach is not necessarily superior. Several economies have been using basic tools such as loan-to-value ratios and concentration limits on particular sectors. These tools are simple to understand and enforce. While their application to only particular sectors appears ad hoc, and a broader counter-cyclical capital buffer to reduce credit growth across the board might seem more appealing, the experience has been that an approach that is targeted towards sectors such as a real estate has the merit of not reducing credit to other sectors such as the corporate and SME sectors. Their efficacy probably stems from simplicity and consistent applications, which condition expectations in the market.  21. Fifth, the term “macroprudential” suggests that these are essentially prudential tools, but with a “macro-orientation”. Indeed, many tools that are “microprudential” in nature also serve the macro-needs as well. Loan-to-value ratios not only raise the buffer for losses but can also constrain credit growth in the economy. Similarly, macro-measures such as the tightening of interest rates can also lean against the build-up of asset prices and serve a microprudential purpose. Pursuing macroprudential objectives therefore does not mean that we have to have a narrow box of tools, each dedicated to a specific purpose. In fact, the interaction of various tools is significant – they can work in the same or opposite directions, and their cumulative impact may be greater or smaller than we anticipate. It is probably more appropriate for us to take an eclectic and holistic approach.  22. Finally, as a corollary of the above, micro- and macro-supervision should not be done in silo. In fact, we need to bring together the perspectives and tools from different stakeholders – central banks and financial supervisors, as well as government agencies that can contribute to financial stability. The property sector cooling measures introduced in Singapore and a number of Asian countries recently, involved close cross-agency cooperation and coordination amongst financial regulators, fiscal authorities and the land 
4 BIS Review 121/2010 offices of the respective countries. Bringing together the various agencies expands the policy options to deal with systemic risks. Different countries have different institutional arrangements, so each country will need to decide on the optimal arrangements.  Achieving regulatory outcomes through effective supervision and shared responsibility with industry  23. Let me now say a few words on achieving regulatory outcomes, beyond good rules. Perhaps the most striking area is the critical need for all of us to strengthen supervision. Effective supervision is unapologetically firm and intense, grounded on a good understanding of the nature of the institutions and the financial system. Supervisors must think independently, avoid regulatory capture and be willing to enforce out-of-bound markers rigorously. In this regard, I welcome the efforts of FSB and standard setters in developing recommendations for more effective supervision of complex and systemic institutions.  24. Effective supervision requires talented and trained staff, who can understand and respond constantly to new markets, new services, and new risks. The need for talent is particularly acute for supervisors in emerging economies, as the banking system grows rapidly. With the growing demand for risk managers, some supervisors are facing higher attrition. We have to significantly expand the talent pool, and work with international and regional bodies like the FSI, the World Bank and IMF to step up our efforts.  25. Finally, supervisors should not be acting alone in achieving the desired regulatory outcomes. Good outcomes cannot depend on a “cat-and-mouse” game of supervisors prescribing rules and then checking for compliance. The primary responsibility of having a sound bank must rest with the Board and senior management of the bank. They need to take ownership of and responsibility for managing risks, and to have the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to discharge their responsibilities effectively.  26. In this regard, MAS recently proposed a number of enhancements to the corporate governance framework for locally incorporated banks. We welcome the Basel Committee’s present initiative to revisit its 2006 corporate governance guidance, and to address weaknesses identified during the crisis.  27. In promoting shared outcomes, political support is crucial in various areas. It is difficult to build a strong banking system on weak macro-economic foundations. Supervisors in all countries, but more so in emerging economies, are sometimes under political pressure to tilt credit growth in certain directions, or to exercise forbearance. While the financial system has to be responsive to the needs of the economy, a politicised supervisory process will almost certainly bring adverse consequences down the road.  Conclusion  28. In conclusion, as we embark on financial reforms, we have to be forward looking, to ensure that we do not just have a resilient global financial system, but also one that can support sustainable economic growth. We need better regulations, better appreciation of the macro-financial linkages, and firmer supervision. Globally coordinated efforts and strong cross border cooperation in some areas, as well as local efforts that are context-specific are both needed to achieve the desired regulatory outcomes.  29. Singapore is honoured to host the 16th ICBS on our common supervisory journey. I wish you a meaningful and fruitful discussion, as well as a pleasant and memorable stay here in Singapore. Thank you. 
BIS Review 120/2010 1 Erkki Liikanen: The enlargement of the euro area 2011 – trust in the future Introductory statement by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Euro Conference, Tallinn, 20 September 2010. *      *      * Estonia has made an impressive journey over the past two decades. This journey, from the rebirth of the country two decades ago, through rapid economic transition, and now into the heart of Europe, has always been followed keenly on the northern side of the Gulf of Finland. In my short introductory statement, I would like to offer some observations on that journey and some wishes for the future. I will try to draw some lessons for other prospective EMU members, but also for the Eurosystem and the EU as a whole. I make these observations from the vantage point of a close neighbour and long-time friend of Estonia.  Timing My first observation concerns the choice of timing. At the same time as Estonia’s EMU criteria were being assessed in Brussels and Frankfurt, European bond markets were under considerable strain. There were signs of panic in trading floors, and the financial press was predicting even the breakdown of the Monetary Union. The reactions were proven, as usual, overblown, and the breakdown predictions badly informed fantasy, but it did all create a rather curious welcome for Estonia into the Monetary Union. But, in a way, in those hectic weeks the EU showed many of its best qualities. It’s institutions were able to take brave decisions when needed as is shown by the establishment of the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). EU also showed the ability to concentrate on Estonia’s case on its own merits, undisturbed by the ongoing instability on the financial markets.  Convergence criteria My second observation is that, although we now have considerable experience in applying the convergence criteria, we still need to work on fine-tuning the way we interpret them. Examination now puts more weight than before on sustainability – and rightly so. Convergence is not about hitting an admissible combination of economic indicators at one point in time. But we may still be concentrating too much on the near term. Convergence is about a lasting commitment to sustainable economic policy. It includes commitment to price stability, to sustainable public finances, and to sustainable private sector development. And, ultimately, it requires the capacity to take the appropriate political decisions when things go wrong. I think it is this last aspect that in the end made Estonia’s admittance relatively smooth. Estonia has shown a remarkable capacity to take difficult political decisions when they are needed. 
2 BIS Review 120/2010 This, I believe, was widely recognized and respected, and helped pave the way for Estonia to join the Monetary Union. It also bodes well for Estonia’s future in EMU.  Boom and bust My third observation regards another factor that also bodes well for Estonia as part of the euro area: the recent boom and bust episode in this country. Estonia went through a very classical cycle of low interest rates, easy credit, and unrealistic expectations, which eventually built into a substantial overheating of the economy, and finally a spectacular bust in 2008–2009. Some countries experienced this as part of the Monetary Union, while Estonia experienced it all by herself. I am optimistic that the experience will prove to be a vaccination against future financial excesses. The Finnish depression in the early 1990s resulted in suffering and economic hardship for many, but it also re-established a more cautious economic attitude that resulted in stronger balance sheets, and ultimately a stronger economy. Finland received a vaccination against financial excesses that has lasted well over a decade. I am optimistic that Estonia will benefit from a similar vaccination, and will emerge from the recession as a stronger economy.  Only the beginning My fourth observation is that this is only the beginning. A lot is going on inside the euro area and the Eurosystem. Economic policy coordination is being given much greater traction than before. In particular, the crisis has shown that a group of countries with a common currency and highly interconnected banking sectors have a great deal of interest in each others’ public finances. How each country chooses to allocate its public expenditure remains mostly its own business. But how a country finances its public expenditure must be a matter of common interest to a much greater degree than we were willing to acknowledge in the past. Enhanced economic governance, including the European Semester, creates a framework for ensuring that budgetary policies take into account the common European interest. I trust Estonia will be a like-minded partner for all of us who will ensure that this framework will work as intended. I am also looking forward to working with the Governor of Eesti Pank on the European Systemic Risk Board that will be established as of the beginning of next year. We have high expectations for this new body. The financial crisis showed that there is a considerable gap between microprudential supervision and monetary policy. We need stronger policy instruments to tackle fluctuations in the credit cycle, the pricing of risk and systemic risk. I also believe that such policy instruments must be able to operate at the cross-border level since, in today’s financial markets, systemic risk propagates very quickly across national boundaries. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) is well placed to take the primary responsibility for controlling systemic risk in Europe. It will have the expertise, access to relevant 
BIS Review 120/2010 3 information and close cooperation with central banks and financial supervisors. What it may still need is more effective instruments to deal with systemic risk. The first couple of years will be a critical in establishing the ESRB’s precise institutional role and operational modalities. The ESRB will no doubt face challenges, and the risk of institutional turf wars is real – particularly with strong national supervisors. But we need to be ambitious and provide the ESRB with sufficient powers to do its job. Again, I hope we can work together with Estonia also on this issue.  Finland and the euro Finally, a few remarks on our own experiences from being a member of the Economic and Monetary Union from the very beginning. As in other countries, there was intensive debate in Finland on the pros and cons of the EMU membership before the final decisions were taken in May 1998. Not surprisingly, opinions at that time were widely divided. Much attention was devoted to the possibility of “asymmetric shocks”. The Finnish economy was judged to be structurally different from those of the so called core European countries, such as Germany, France and the Benelux countries. The sceptics believed the economic stability of Finland was likely to suffer if economic development were too “asymmetric” vis-à-vis the core countries. There were good historical reasons for this early scepticism. The structure of the Finnish economy had been one-sided. The share of forest-based industries in industrial production and exports, although declining, was much larger than in other European countries. Only one-third of Finland’s exports went to the prospective euro area countries, implying that the country was likely to be more vulnerable than others to shocks coming from outside the euro area. There was also a particular concern about exchange rate movements. Especially, there were fears that the movements in the Swedish krona, the pound sterling and the US dollar  vis-à-vis the euro would undermine the competitiveness of the Finnish economy. After 12 years in EMU it should be possible to draw at least preliminary conclusions about whether these fears were justified or not. Firstly, we did face an “asymmetric” shock at the very beginning of the Monetary Union. However, contrary to the pre-EMU fears, this shock turned out to be a positive shock, not a negative one. In 1998–2000, Finland was surfing on the wave of the ICT boom. In normal circumstances this would have called for real appreciation of the currency, either in the form of nominal appreciation or accelerating inflation. Neither of these happened. In retrospect, it seems that membership of EMU, in fact, had a stabilising effect on the economy in the face of an “asymmetric” shock. The current global crisis hit the Finnish economy more severely than other euro area countries. GDP dropped by 8% in 2009, the biggest decline since 1918. In the course of two decades Finland had become increasingly specialized in the production of capital goods and ICT products. When global investment activity collapsed together with world trade, Finnish exports and industrial production dropped by one third. Normally, a sharp decline in exports and industrial production would have been followed by a sizable decline in private consumption as disposable income diminished and the risk of unemployment increased. None of these developments occurred. 
4 BIS Review 120/2010 Consumer confidence was held up by low interest rates, the feared collapse in construction activity did not materialize, the rise in unemployment proved to be far less than forecast. Three additional factors contributed to this relatively favourable outcome. Firstly, government finances were initially in good shape. As a result, risk premia remained low, despite significant deterioration in the fiscal balance. Secondly, the banking sector remained in a strong position throughout the cycle. It seems that the vaccination against extravagancies obtained during the banking crisis of the early 1990s was still effective 15 years later. Thirdly, house price increases remained relatively moderate, at least compared with most other euro area countries and, indeed, most other OECD countries. The avoidance of a house price decline helped stabilize the economy during the downturn. Please, do not misunderstand me. My intention is not to be complacent on the Finnish economy and economic policy in Finland. Membership of EMU and good policy explain only a part of the relatively good performance of the Finnish economy since the introduction of the euro. Good luck explains an important part as well. Had the ICT boom lasted two more years at the beginning of the past decade, it is very likely that serious imbalances would have developed in the Finnish economy. Had the global investment boom, which “asymmetrically” strongly favoured Finnish exporters, lasted two more years in the latter half of the decade, we would probably have seen wage inflation accelerate and a house price bubble emerge in Finland, too.  The bottom line The bottom line of these remarks is that membership in the Monetary Union has had a stabilizing effect on the Finnish economy over the past 12 years. However, membership in itself does not guarantee stability and growth. What economic policy could and should do, both inside and outside the Monetary Union, is to prevent the emergence of excessive indebtedness in both the public and the private sector, and the development of asset price bubbles. On both sides of the Gulf of Finland, we know from experience that this is not an easy task. 
BIS Review 120/2010 1 Hidetoshi Kamezaki: Recent economic and financial developments in Japan Summary of a speech by Mr Hidetoshi Kamezaki, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at a meeting with business leaders, Sapporo, 28 July 2010. *      *      * I. The economy and prices A. The current economic situation Following the precipitous deterioration in the wake of the Lehman shock in the fall of 2008, Japan’s economy, since bottoming out in spring 2009, has been showing signs of a moderate recovery. The main driving force of the recovery has been improvement in overseas economic conditions, as a result of which Japan’s exports and production have been increasing, while business fixed investment is showing signs of picking up. Moreover, the government’s economic stimulus measures favoring environment-friendly products have contributed significantly to the pick-up in private consumption. Overseas economies have continued to recover moderately, underpinned by the effects of both stimulus measures adopted around the world and inventory restocking. Looking at developments by region, the Chinese economy has continued to manifest high growth, supported by the surge in fixed asset investment spurred by a large stimulus package of 4 trillion renminbi, although recently the pace of growth has slowed somewhat. The U.S. economy has been recovering at a moderate pace, supported by a massive stimulus package of 780 billion U.S. dollars. European economies overall are also picking up  – although there are some differences across countries – led by increases in exports and production partly due to a decline in their currencies. Recovery in the euro area, however, has been weaker than in other regions because stimulus measures adopted in the region were relatively small in scale, economic structures lack flexibility, and credit uncertainty triggered by the fiscal problems in Greece remains. Against this background, Japan’s exports to all regions continued to increase. This has brought about production growth, led business fixed investment to pick up and caused household income to stop declining. The key elements of the government’s economic stimulus measures favoring energy-efficient products are the eco-point system for electrical appliances, as well as tax reductions and subsidies for purchases of environment-friendly cars. These measures, together with the greatly improved cost performance of the products, the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial broadcasting, and the extended lifespan of automobiles, have tapped potential replacement demand and had a significant positive effect on the sales of products covered by these measures. In addition, it seems that the measures have provided consumers with an incentive to visit retail stores and encouraged them to purchase products to which the stimulus measures do not apply, such as DVD recorders that are compatible with flat-panel TVs and the latest home cleaning robots. This increase in spending on durable consumer goods has had a positive effect on the economy by increasing production. In sum, Japan’s economy has been supported by two major engines of growth, namely, the improvement in overseas economic conditions and the government’s economic stimulus measures favoring environment-friendly products. However, because the recovery remains weak in areas that have not directly benefited from these developments, many people have yet to feel that the economy overall is recovering. Moreover, although Japan’s economy enjoyed relatively high growth of around 5 percent at an annualized rate from the end of 2009 through the beginning of 2010, the level of economic activity remains lower than before the Lehman shock. It is, thus, too early to say that a self-sustaining upturn in domestic private demand is fuelling a robust recovery. 
2 BIS Review 120/2010 B. The economic outlook Next, I will talk about the outlook for Japan’s economy. The effects of the two factors that have so far been the engines of economic growth are likely to weaken. Specifically, overseas economies, including those that currently are growing at a rapid pace, seem likely to slow to more steady and sustainable rates of growth as the effects of inventory restocking and stimulus measures abate. The uptrend in Japan’s exports is expected to continue, but the pace of increase is likely to moderate gradually. Durable goods consumption is expected to fall temporarily in reaction to the termination of the government’s economic stimulus measures favoring energy-efficient products: subsidies for purchases of environment-friendly cars expire at the end of September, while the eco-point system for electrical appliances expires at the end of December. New factors should be taken into account, however. For example, the government’s child allowances, which started in June, are expected to help support private consumption. Moreover, business fixed investment and household income are likely to pick up, reflecting an improvement in the capacity utilization rate and in corporate profits. Supported by these factors, Japan’s economy should assume a moderate recovery trend. The outlook I just presented, however, is subject to various upside and downside risks. One upside risk is that growth in emerging and commodity-exporting economies might accelerate. Recently, a growing number of emerging and commodity-exporting economies have been shifting away from accommodative monetary policies, while in China, the government has implemented measures to curb the overheating of the real estate market. However, if capital from industrialized economies – which are persisting with accommodative monetary policies – continues to flow into these countries and thereby exacerbates overheating in asset markets, it could boost growth. These developments could then pose an upside risk to Japan’s economy by means of an increase in exports. Such developments would not be wholly desirable since overheating in emerging and commodity-exporting economies would inevitably lead to a tightening of policies, which might then pose a downside risk to Japan’s economy. When considering downside risks, the growing instability in global financial markets warrants attention. The fiscal problems in Greece and some other European countries will not only lead to a deterioration in domestic demand in these countries as a result of fiscal austerity measures, but also exert downward pressure on European economies as a whole in a number of ways. These include fiscal consolidation in other countries, as they attempt to avoid a similar fate; the weakening of the financial intermediary function of financial institutions that own sovereign debt issued by countries stricken by the crisis; and a decline in the propensity to consume, as a result of uncertainties surrounding overall markets. The direct impact on Japan’s economy is likely to be minimal, as its lending to countries in the region is inconsiderable, while exports to Europe account for only about 10 percent of the total. However, for China and the United States – the major destinations of Japanese exports – Europe accounts for about 20 percent of exports and Japan could, therefore, be indirectly affected. Furthermore, it is necessary to be aware of downside risks, stemming from the effects of the yen’s appreciation against the euro, on Japan’s export competitiveness, as well as the impact of financial market instability on firms’ funds procurement. C. Price developments I will now move on to prices. Commodity prices, which have a major impact on price developments in Japan, have been on a rising trend, reflecting high growth in emerging economies. As a result, recent import prices have been about 10 percent above year-ago levels, after having plunged more than 30 percent year on year in summer 2009. In addition, the domestic corporate goods price index (CGPI), which measures fluctuations in prices of goods traded between firms in Japan, has risen somewhat above levels for the same period a year ago. 
BIS Review 120/2010 3 The consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food (the core CPI), which measures the price of goods and services purchased by households, has been declining on a year-on-year basis since March 2009, indicating deflation. However, following the largest year-on-year decline of 2.4 percent in August 2009, the pace of decline has been moderating as a trend. Meanwhile, the pace of decline in the CPI excluding food and energy, or the core-core CPI, which is not usually susceptible to commodity price fluctuations, has also been moderating recently, after marking the largest fall of 1.2 percent at the beginning of 2010. These developments, apart from the rise in commodity prices, probably occurred because the Japanese economy bottomed out and started recovering around spring 2009, and the effects of the narrowing of the negative output gap began to be reflected in prices with a lag of about one year. The year-on-year rate of decline in the core CPI is likely to continue slowing, reflecting the rise in commodity prices and the narrowing of the negative output gap, and the rate of change in the CPI may even enter positive territory in fiscal 2011. There are, needless to say, both upside and downside risks associated with the outlook for prices, just as for economic activity. The upside risks include an upswing in commodity prices caused by stronger-than-expected growth in emerging economies. On the other hand, price developments could deviate downward from the outlook if pessimism among the public spreads due to a slower-than-expected recovery of the economy. A decline in the medium- to long-term inflation expectations of various economic entities could trigger a fall in the actual inflation rate. Thus, risks associated with price developments require careful monitoring. II. Measures taken by the Bank Next, I will elaborate on the Bank’s policy measures since the start of the recent global financial crisis. A. Measures to address the rapid financial contraction In order to address the rapid financial contraction triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers, the Bank successively conducted same-day funds-supplying operations and introduced U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations as emergency measures to provide liquidity for financial markets. Furthermore, the Bank decided to introduce outright purchases of CP and corporate bonds, based on the recognition that a significant decline in the functioning of markets, such as the serious shortage of liquidity in the CP and corporate bond markets, was causing a tightening of overall corporate financing conditions. In addition, the Bank introduced a series of temporary emergency measures to facilitate corporate financing, including the easing of the rating requirement for corporate debt to be accepted as eligible collateral and the special funds-supplying operation to facilitate corporate financing, through which the Bank provided 3-month funds for an unlimited amount against the value of corporate debt pledged as collateral at a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent. Furthermore, in order to ensure an accommodative financial environment, on both October 31 and December 19, 2008, the Bank reduced the target level of the policy interest rate (the uncollateralized overnight call rate), bringing it down from 0.5 percent to the current 0.1 percent. In order to provide ample liquidity through maintaining the policy interest rate at this low level, the Bank also introduced the complementary deposit facility, whereby interest is made payable on excess reserve balances held at the Bank by financial institutions. At the same time, the Bank introduced temporary measures to secure the stability of the financial system, given that the strains in global financial markets and the subsequent fall in stock prices and rise in credit costs had greatly affected financial institutions’ intermediary function and financial soundness. Such measures include the purchase of stocks held by financial institutions to help them reduce the market risk associated with stock holdings and the provision of subordinated loans to banks to help them maintain sufficient capital bases. 
4 BIS Review 120/2010 Since then, the Bank has been gradually bringing to an end some of its temporary measures as financial markets have regained stability. In May 2010, however, in order to address the increased strains in global financial markets triggered by the fiscal problems in Greece and some other European countries, the Bank re-established the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations that had been wound up at the beginning of February 2010. B. Measures to address deflation Although financial markets have been gradually regaining stability and the economy is showing signs of a moderate recovery, the Bank recognizes that Japan’s economy still faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation and returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability. For this reason, the Bank reiterated its commitment to fight deflation. Regarding the “understanding of medium- to long-term price stability” (the level of inflation that each Policy Board member understands, when conducting monetary policy, as being consistent with price stability over the medium to long term; hereinafter “understanding”), the Bank, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held in December 2009, made it clear that the Policy Board does not tolerate a year-on-year rate of change in the CPI equal to or below 0 percent, and that the midpoints of most Policy Board members’ “understanding” are around 1 percent. On this basis, the Bank continues to maintain the policy rate at the extremely low level of 0.1 percent. Moreover, in order to ease monetary conditions further by encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates, the Bank in December 2009 introduced a new fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral (hereinafter fixed-rate operation), whereby funds with a maturity of three months are provided at an extremely low interest rate of 0.1 percent. The total amount of loans to be provided through the fixed-rate operation was first set at approximately 10 trillion yen in December 2009, but this was increased to approximately 20 trillion yen in March 2010. C. Introduction of the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth Through the measures I have mentioned so far, the Bank has been providing ample funds to financial markets and financial institutions. However, the funds have not been sufficient to feed into the economy and bring about strong growth. Therefore, as the central bank, the Bank examined ways in which it could support financial institutions, in their efforts in terms of lending and investment, in a way that would help strengthen the foundations for economic growth. As a result of deliberations, the Bank on June 15, 2010, decided to introduce a new fund-provisioning measure to strengthen the foundations for economic growth. The measure provides funds for financial institutions, reflecting their efforts in terms of lending and investment to strengthen economic growth at a loan rate equivalent to the Bank’s policy interest rate, which currently is only 0.1 percent. The duration of each loan provided by the Bank is one year in principle, and the maximum duration of the loans is four years, including rollovers. With this measure, the Bank hopes to offer the broadest support possible for the various efforts that financial institutions make on their own initiative. The Bank will start providing funds by around the end of August 2010 and new loans will be disbursed quarterly. The measure is temporary and the Bank set March 31, 2012, as the deadline for new loan applications, so that financial institutions would accelerate their implementation of lending and investment. The Bank has already started making necessary preparations to provide funds through this measure. On June 25, the Bank announced it had selected 66 counterparty financial institutions for fund-provisioning through public application. Not only major banks, but also a wide range of other financial institutions, including regional banks, became counterparties. Each counterparty submitted its plan for strengthening the foundations for economic growth to the Bank, which is currently evaluating each counterparty’s eligibility based on the amount 
BIS Review 120/2010 5 of lending and investment carried out under the plan in the April-June quarter of 2010. Based on the evaluation, the Bank will determine how much it will lend in its first disbursement. Let me next explain the background to the Bank’s decision to introduce this fund-provisioning measure. III. Strengthening the foundations for economic growth A. Deflation As I mentioned earlier, Japan is experiencing deflation. Price instability, including deflation, has various negative effects on the economy and society. For instance, it reduces the efficiency of resource allocation, restrains economic activity by making economic outlook uncertain, and distorts income distribution by changing the real value of contracts, assets and liabilities, which are typically in nominal terms. In addition, there are problems particular to deflation. For example, it has been pointed out that debtors with a high propensity to consume tend to restrain their spending when the real value of their debt rises, weighing down the economy. In addition, due to the zero bound on nominal interest rates, real interest rates do not fall to the level required by the level of economic activity. Declining inflation rates are a trend shared by all major economies around the world. It is only in Japan, however, that prices in terms of the CPI excluding food and energy (the core-core CPI) have been falling. The main reason for this is the large output gap, which has remained consistently negative since the second half of the 1990s. What is more, the gap has been much larger than in other major economies. This is attributable to the excess supply capacity that has not been adequately adjusted relative to the level of domestic demand, which has stayed sluggish since the bursting of the economic bubble. Weakness in domestic demand was prolonged by the delay in balance-sheet adjustments by various economic entities and the lack of forward-looking expenditure since the bursting of the economic bubble. In particular, the delay in the disposal of impaired assets by financial institutions weakened their financial intermediary functions, impairing their ability to provide sufficient funds for new areas of growth. The pressure on various economic entities to adjust their balance sheets has more or less disappeared since the beginning of 2000. However, the prolonged period of weak domestic demand has been compounded by the recent onset of population decline, pushing down economic entities’ expectations for economic growth and forestalling forward-looking expenditure. The Lehman shock in 2008 dealt another serious blow to demand and its impact continues to this day. One reason that supply capacity has not been sufficiently adjusted despite stagnant demand is that, as a result of various regulations and protection measures, factors of production have remained in areas from which demand has shifted away. There is a possibility that inflation expectations will lessen if expectations for future economic growth continue to decline and the output gap does not narrow steadily. In this case, consumers of goods and services may put off spending, while suppliers may cut prices further to stimulate demand. Under these circumstances, although the output gap remains unchanged, prices may fall further and deflation may become even more difficult to quell. At present, medium- to long-term inflation expectations remain stable and it is important to make sure that they do not decrease. B. Overcoming deflation In order for Japan’s economy to overcome deflation, it is necessary to narrow the negative output gap. To this end, demand has to be expanded. The task is not impossible and there are various areas with potential demand to be tapped, such as sectors related to the provision of healthy and safe food, the environment, and population aging. An example of such latent demand is the recent government measures that sharply increased demand for 
6 BIS Review 120/2010 environment-friendly durable goods. Needless to say, it is also important to follow developments in overseas demand. As I mentioned earlier, economic growth in emerging and commodity-exporting economies has been astounding, and it is very likely that their demand for Japanese goods and services still has much room for growth. The issue at stake is how to tap such demand. The government’s “New Growth Strategy” and “Fiscal Management Strategy,” both announced in June, may provide some pointers. The “New Growth Strategy” aims to create a strong Japanese economy on the basis of the measures for demand creation that I just mentioned, together with steps to overcome constraints on the supply of goods and the circulation of funds to be implemented in accordance with a specific timetable. The “Fiscal Management Strategy,” meanwhile, aims to restore a sound and sustainable fiscal structure in a way that is consistent with the “New Growth Strategy.” In any event, it is vital that these measures be implemented swiftly and on schedule. Moreover, private economic entities, in addition to tapping new areas of demand, need to improve productivity through new manufacturing technology and by shifting capital and labor to areas with higher productivity. The “New Growth Strategy” can support such efforts. It could be argued that higher productivity will increase supply, which would cause a further widening of the output gap. However, it should be pointed out that higher productivity would raise the demand for products of highly productive firms and workers; that the anticipation of such an increase in future demand would raise current demand; and that, thus, the efficiency of resource allocation could be improved, which in turn would expand demand overall. The Industrial Revolution in Britain provides evidence of the pivotal role played by increased productivity in a nation’s growth. During the Industrial Revolution in the early nineteenth century, the Luddite movement emerged in which workers destroyed machines that deprived them of their jobs. Mechanization, however, increased productivity and enhanced Britain’s growth potential, paving the way for the subsequent ascendancy of the British Empire. There is no doubt that enhancing productivity is indispensable for Japan given the aging and decline of the population. While it will be difficult to avoid the problems arising from a declining population in the short term, increased productivity can help to avoid a decline in the potential growth rate and maintain the vitality of the Japanese economy. C. Measures taken by the Bank The fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth introduced by the Bank on June 15, 2010, aims to support private financial institutions’ efforts of their own accord to provide funds required by private economic entities to find new demand and enhance productivity. It is hoped that the move will help to increase potential output growth, narrow the output gap, and eventually bring deflation to an end. In this sense, the measure is consistent with the principle stipulated in Article 2 of the Bank of Japan Act that the Bank will aim at “achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy.” Instead of merely expressing the objective in words, the Bank is taking action in the belief that this policy will work as a catalyst for private economic entities to join in to achieve a common goal. I am constantly aware that the Bank always must be ready to proactively implement the appropriate policies. Going forward, the Bank should continue to be proactive and do its utmost to bring Japan’s economy back to a sustainable growth path with price stability. 
BIS Review 119/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: Euro Star Event to raise public awareness and facilitate changeover to the euro in Estonia Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro Star Event at the Bank of Estonia, Tallinn, 19 September 2010. *      *      * Dear Governor Lipstok, Ladies and gentlemen, The introduction of the euro is a historic moment for any EU Member State, and the euro itself is also a historic achievement for Europe. Indeed, the euro is one of the most tangible signs of the cohesion and mutual trust, among Europe’s citizens. Since its introduction back in 1999, the depth of feeling generated by the euro has been remarkable. A lot of the attention gained by the euro has been directed not only at the currency itself, but rather at the underlying strategic vision, of which it has become the symbol. The forthcoming enlargement of the euro area to include Estonia demonstrates that the euro area is not a “closed shop”. Its doors are open to the EU Member State that fulfils the necessary preconditions in a sustainable manner. 1 January 2011 will become a landmark in the history of Estonia, reflecting the long and challenging process of economic and monetary integration that has enabled Estonia to join the euro area.  The euro banknotes and coins are now an important and natural part of our daily lives. And this will soon be the case for the people of Estonia.  In preparing for the changeover, we have enjoyed excellent cooperation with Eesti Pank and the Estonian Government, working very closely also with the European Commission. And this, I am sure, will make the introduction of the euro in Estonia a success.  Today, Eesti Pank and the European Central Bank are launching the Euro Campaign Estonia 2011, an extensive media campaign to help the people of Estonia to become acquainted with the euro banknotes and coins, the security features of the banknotes and the changeover modalities. The campaign comprises TV advertisements, print publications, public relations activities, interactive applications for the internet and special support for the media.  In total, we have four TV spots that will be aired from November 2010 to mid-January 2011, and these form the backbone of our communications activities for the general public.  The first TV spot sets the mood of the campaign and familiarises viewers with the appearance of the euro banknotes and shows the gates and bridges featured on the banknotes. The gates symbolise the spirit of openness and cooperation in Europe. The bridges represent the very close relationship and cooperation between the people of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world.  The other three spots are shorter and focus on the security features of the euro banknotes, in particular, the “feel-look-tilt” technique that people can easily use to check the authenticity of our banknotes.  And I am pleased to be able to show you the four TV spots for the first time. Action! Dear Governor Lipstok, Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour for me to be here tonight to present you with the Euro Star. Since the inception of the Euro notes and coins, this unique memento has been a gift signifying a warm welcome to the “Eurosystem family”. In a way, the very idea of the Euro Star reminds me of 
2 BIS Review 119/2010 your Kõpu Lighthouse, the world’s oldest functioning lighthouse built in 1531. Like a bright star, this lighthouse has safely guided the merchant fleets bringing prosperity to Estonia. I believe that, in its own way, the euro will serve as a similar beacon. It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to present the Euro Star to Governor Lipstok as a symbol of Eesti Pank joining the Eurosystem on 1 January 2011. We all very much look forward to welcoming Estonia to the euro area. Tere tulemast, Eesti! [Welcome Estonia!] 
BIS Review 119/2010 1 Glenn Stevens: Monetary policy and the regions Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Foodbowl Unlimited Forum Business luncheon, Shepparton, 20 September 2010. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to come to Shepparton. No one knew, when the invitation was issued almost a year ago, that you would be battling floodwaters just a couple of weeks prior to today. It is good to see the recovery already well advanced.  In the global economy, recovery from the effects of a different kind of deluge – a man-made one – has been under way for a while. Progress has been quite varied, however, and the outlook is uncertain just now. I will give an update on those matters today. It also seems a fitting occasion to talk about “monetary policy and the regions”, since a question we are often asked is how we take account of differing economic conditions across the country in the setting of monetary policy. I will offer some perspectives on the issues that arise when we have one policy instrument for a fairly diverse economy. The essential message here is that such diversity matters, but is often not as pronounced as people assume, because all the parts of the economy are ultimately connected. Things that affect one sector tend to have spillover effects elsewhere. Furthermore, economies have a certain capacity to adjust to differing conditions. In Australia this works reasonably well.  Current economic conditions The global economy continues to present a mixed picture. In the Asian region, most countries have well and truly recovered from a downturn that occurred in late 2008 and the first few months of 2009. The main exception is Japan. In the bulk of cases, economies are much closer to their potential output paths now than they were a year ago and policies are moving to less expansionary settings. As a result, over the year ahead the growth in the Asian region is unlikely to be as rapid as over the year to mid 2010, when the “v-shaped” recovery was in full swing. Similar comments could probably be made about Latin America. In Europe, the German economy has been powering ahead this year, reaping the benefits of many years of attention to containing costs and building productivity. But other continental economies are not as strong, and some are in the grip of a very painful adjustment to a world of constricted private credit and limits to budgetary flexibility. In the United States an expansion has been under way for some time, but seems lately to have been losing a bit of steam and growth has recently not been robust enough to reduce high unemployment.  In Australia, growth has been quite solid over the past year, unemployment is relatively low, and inflation has, for the moment, declined. In fact, growth trends have been favourable over several years now in comparison with many other economies. The charts below, comparing trends in Australia’s real GDP per capita with that of several countries, are illustrative. Of course we cannot match the extent of growth in China – a country where living standards are rapidly increasing in a process of “catch up” to the higher levels of high-income countries (Graph 1). But it is clear that compared with the US or Europe, or Japan, Australia’s per capita output and income has done pretty well over the past several years (Graph 2). 
2 BIS Review 119/2010 Graph 1  Graph 2  The task ahead, then, is to seek as far as possible to continue a solid trend like this, through various challenges which lie ahead. The future is of course unknowable, and economic forecasts unfortunately are not very reliable. But we have no option but to try to form a view of how things will probably unfold. 
BIS Review 119/2010 3 We think the global economy will record reasonable growth over the coming year, though not as strong as the past year (a strength that, incidentally, surprised most observers). We think Australia’s terms of trade, after reaching a 60-year high in the current quarter, will probably decline a bit, but remain high. We expect that this high level of relative export prices will add to incomes and spending, even as the stimulative effects of earlier low interest rates and budgetary measures continue to unwind. We expect, and indications from businesses are that they do as well, that resource sector investment will rise further – as we experience the largest minerals and energy boom since the late 19th century. Even with continued caution by households, that probably means that overall growth, which has been at about trend over the past year, will increase in 2011 to something above trend. We think that means that the fall in inflation over the past two years won’t go much further.  Of course that central forecast could turn out to be wrong. Something could turn up  – internationally or at home – that produces some other outcome. We spend a fair bit of time thinking about what such things could be. Possible candidates might be a return to economic contraction in the United States, or a bigger than expected slowdown in China, or the resumption of financial turmoil that abruptly curtails access to capital markets for banks around the world and damages confidence generally. But if downside possibilities do not materialise, the task ahead is likely to be one of managing a fairly robust upswing. Part of that task will, clearly, fall to monetary policy. The objectives of monetary policy What then are the objectives of monetary policy? Put simply, our job is to preserve the value of money over time and to try, so far as possible, to keep the economy near its full employment potential. Over the long run, these are mutually reinforcing goals, not conflicting ones. For the past 17 years the way we have pursued these goals has been to operate a medium-term target for CPI inflation of 2–3 per cent, on average. The “on average” specification allows us to accept short-term fluctuations in inflation – as long as they are only short-term – and so avoid the risk of attempting to over-control inflation and in the process de-stabilising the economy. But the specification still requires us to limit inflation in the medium term. Over the 17-year period, CPI inflation has averaged 2.5 per cent (excluding the one-time impact of the GST in 2000), and the economy generally has exhibited more stability, with real GDP mostly a little closer to trend than it had been in the preceding couple of decades. How does monetary policy work? The Reserve Bank has very effective control over one interest rate – namely the rate that applies when one financial institution lends cash overnight to another (hence the label the “cash rate”). This rate has a major impact – though not to the exclusion of other forces – on a range of short-term market rates. Since the bulk of financing activity in Australia is contracted on variable interest rates, that are axiomatically affected by changes in short-term rates, the rates paid by borrowers are usually closely affected by cash rate decisions – though other factors can impinge as well from time to time. Through this device the Bank can affect the relative incentives for saving versus borrowing, and so have an impact on spending on goods and services and on financial and “real” assets. Because the relative rates of return on Australian assets compared with foreign assets are altered when we change interest rates here, the exchange rate also moves in response to monetary policy changes (although most of the time it is moving in response to a host of other factors as well).  Often, the expectation of what will happen to the cash rate in the future is just as important as, or even more important than, the level of the cash rate today. For this reason what the Bank says – or what people think we have said – can be very influential on markets and 
4 BIS Review 119/2010 behaviour. It is for this reason that central bankers are usually so guarded in public comments. The effects of monetary policy in a diverse economy It is obvious even from the above highly condensed description that monetary policy will affect different groups in different ways. For a start, changing interest rates shifts the distribution of income between savers and borrowers. The larger the size of one’s balance sheet – either assets or debt – the more likely one is to be affected by a change in rates of interest. Someone with no debt and no savings will probably feel little impact – if they feel anything at all – of a change in interest rates, at least directly. In addition, we only have one set of interest rates for the whole Australian economy; we do not have different interest rates for certain regions or industries. We set policy for the average Australian conditions. A given region or industry may not fully feel the strength or weakness in the overall economy to which the Bank is responding with monetary policy. In fact no region or industry may be having exactly the “average” experience. It is this phenomenon that people presumably have in mind when they refer to monetary policy being a “blunt instrument”. The issue is that it is not possible to have different monetary policies by region or by industry within the country, at least not while we are all using one currency and funds are free to flow around. Either each area that wanted its own interest rate would also have to have its own currency, or there would need to be a draconian set of regulations to prevent savings in one region flowing to another to be loaned out – a sort of local and regional equivalent to the pervasive capital controls which once existed on international capital movements. Quite possibly both of the above might be needed for a comprehensive tailoring of interest rates to each set of local conditions. Obviously that is unlikely to be practical. Moreover there would be costs for a region having its own currency. It would have to establish its own Reserve Bank for a start, and would have to accept additional transactions costs for cross-border transactions with other regions, which would probably inhibit trade and investment flows with other regions in its own country. Very small currency areas have also often got into trouble over the years. These are reasons why many very small countries often peg their currency to that of a larger neighbour or simply adopt that currency outright. Perceived gains from being part of a larger monetary union have continued to attract small European countries to the euro, even though the membership conditions are fairly demanding, as we have recently seen. There is a field of economics that thinks about this set of issues. Apart from the obvious criteria like language, culture and political unity, a suitable case for a single currency is thought to be stronger when:  the forces (“shocks”) that affect a group of regions or countries are fairly similar and the way in which the regional economies respond is similar;  there is a lot of trade between the regions (as there usually is within a single country);   factors of production (labour and capital) flow fairly easily between the regions in response to differences in conditions; and/or   when other means for responding to differences in experience (particularly fiscal transfers) are available.  That framework suggests several questions we might ask for Australia and its regions:   How different are the shocks by region?   How flexibly does the economy respond to such differences?  
BIS Review 119/2010 5  What other policy mechanisms are at work to respond?   And finally, how different, ultimately, are the experiences after these responses have occurred?  Differences across the country It is worth observing that not all “shocks” that hit the economy have markedly different effects by region or industry. Some of them are fairly widespread in their effect. Take the sudden intensification of financial turmoil in September 2008. Confidence slumped and people began to “batten down the hatches” – in just about every industry and every region around the world – more or less simultaneously. Banks became more cautious in lending – most particularly to the property sector, but generally to almost all borrowers – in every country. Other shocks are more particular. The one most people would think likely to have a differential impact across regions would be the big rise in mining prices and associated build-up in investment that we saw a few years ago, and which has returned over the past year and a half. Since the mineral resources are not found in abundance in every region, some areas would be expected to receive more of a boost than others. For example in Western Australia, mining accounts for a quarter of production; it is only 2 per cent of production in Victoria. So it would seem obvious that the impact of an event that increases the demand for minerals is likely to see, in time, the output of WA given more of a boost than that of Victoria. But as usual, the picture gets more complicated when we think further. The headquarters of some major mining companies are in Melbourne. Those companies will be putting additional demand on various service providers around the nation – from air travel to consultants, from geologists to manufacturers, and so on. The effects of the engineering and construction build up for some of the minerals investment will be felt in other regions around the country (and indeed also by overseas suppliers). The higher incomes generated from the mineral boom will be felt by employees, shareholders (some of whom are overseas) and by governments (via various taxes). Depending on how these entities respond to these gains in income, there will be subsequent effects on economic activity around the country. It may well still be the case that the effects are most obvious and most pronounced in WA, but there will be substantial spillovers as the economy responds. Incidentally, most data suggest that until quite recently economic activity was growing faster in Victoria than in WA. So to the second question, how about the mobility of factors of production? A remarkable feature of some of the remote area mining operations is the way the labour operates on a “fly-in, fly-out” basis. Any user of Perth airport can easily attest to this but the “commutes” also occur from the eastern states. More generally, population shifts have long been occurring between the south-eastern states and the resource-rich states. While moving is costly, in most analyses I have seen the mobility of the Australian workforce is pretty good – people shift in response to opportunity. Capital is of course highly mobile, at least at the margin. As for other policy mechanisms at work, there are substantial fiscal transfers. The “automatic stabilisers” will take more taxes from regions that are doing well, since incomes will be rising relatively quickly, and transfer it to areas doing less well in the form of welfare payments. Governments can also use discretionary spending or other policies as part of this. Moreover there are structures in place that are deliberately designed to lessen systematically the differences in outcomes which might otherwise occur. Opinions will differ about how effective these have been, and about how effective they should be – as recent political events have probably demonstrated. But the general point is that in a political federation such as Australia, there are various fiscal transfer mechanisms that act to diminish the divergences that might result from differences in initial conditions and exposure 
6 BIS Review 119/2010 to economic events. This is likely to be less so in an area which is a monetary union but not a political federation. Indeed some economists have long pointed to this as a potential difficulty for the euro area in some sets of circumstances, like the ones that exist in Europe at present. That said, we are seeing, albeit on a somewhat ad hoc basis, more intra-European transfer mechanisms being developed. So for Australia, the effects of a “shock”, even if concentrated initially, will tend to be felt more generally across the economy over time. The way the economy works will naturally tend to help this occur, as will various other policy devices. That is what is supposed to happen in a well-functioning, integrated national economy. The next question, then, is how different outcomes turn out to be after all these mechanisms have responded to the various impacts. Of course differences will remain at the industry level – ultimately, it looks likely that the mining sector and the areas that supply it will grow, and some other industries will, relatively, get smaller. And at this point, much of the impact of the recent resource price changes is yet to be seen. Nonetheless it is still worth examining just how different key trends have been to date across regions.  There are various indicators at a state level and even a regional level. These are of varying reliability – sample sizes get pretty small in some cases. Two of the more reliable data sets are likely to be the consumer price index and the unemployment rate. It is these, of course, that people are probably most interested in as well. The CPI is available only for capital cities. Consumer prices in the capital cities have tracked remarkably closely (Graph 3) – at least as much as in other single currency areas like the United States or the euro area (Graphs 4 and 5). Graph 3  
BIS Review 119/2010 7 Graph 4  Graph 5  In the case of unemployment rates, a fair bit of disaggregated data is available. Graph 6 below shows the national unemployment rate and the range across the statistical regions measured by the ABS for which there are reasonably reliable continuous time series.1 If we                                                  1  In general, the most disaggregated data available have been used. However, the “Northern, Far West-North Western and Central West” statistical region in NSW has not been disaggregated, as there have been instances in the past when the ABS did not publish data for one of its sub-regions. The number of regions varies with data availability, with two breaks in the series when the number of regions changed. From November 2007, there are 68 statistical regions. 
8 BIS Review 119/2010 weight these unemployment rates by population, the shaded area is where 80 per cent of the weighted observations lie. Recent rates of unemployment have been between almost zero in the Hunter region (outside of Newcastle) of New South Wales and about 9 per cent in the far north of Queensland. Eighty per cent of the population face unemployment rates between 3 and 7 per cent. Graph 6   Graph 7  
BIS Review 119/2010 9 Also shown is the dispersion at a state level (Graph 7), which enables a comparison with the 50 states of the United States, and the 16 countries of the euro area (Graphs 8 and 9). Graph 8  Graph 9  
10 BIS Review 119/2010 These comparisons are affected just now by the fact that the US and Europe have had deep recessions and are only in an early stage of recovery, whereas Australia had only a mild downturn and unemployment has been falling for about a year now. As the charts show, dispersion of unemployment rates does tend to have a cyclical dimension. Nonetheless I think it is reasonable, based on the history shown here, to conclude that, while some events can lead to a divergence in economic conditions across Australia, overall these differences have not been especially large in recent times compared with those seen in other entities with whom we might compare ourselves. That is not to say the differences are unimportant or immaterial to people’s lives, nor that they could not get larger. Nonetheless some perspective as to how large they actually have been is useful. How does the reserve bank keep track of different economic performances? That having been said, it is important to add that the Reserve Bank makes considerable efforts to look below the level of national data in its pursuit of a full understanding of what is happening on the ground. Over the past decade or so we have put substantial resources into a comprehensive liaison program with firms, industry groups and state and regional government entities. Officers based in every mainland state capital spend much of their time talking to people about what is going on. Every month they talk to up to 100 organisations around the country. I know that some of our staff visited Shepparton last month and some of you may have met them. The purpose of this is to help us understand what is happening “at the coal face” – the conditions that businesses are actually experiencing and the things that concern them. This helps give a richer and often more timely understanding of what is going on than the higher-level aggregate data alone might provide. Talking to businesses about their plans for the future helps inform our forecasts, and has been especially useful recently for building a profile of conditions in different sectors, such as expected investment in the mining sector over the coming years. This is important for our analysis of capacity in, for instance, the mining sector, which affects how we see commodity prices, the terms of trade, the exchange rate and exports. Conclusion As a physically large country, with quite a diverse set of industries, and our largest population centres separated by long distances and even living in different climates, Australia is always likely to see some differences in economic experience by region. What is remarkable, in fact, is that the differences are not, in the end, larger. That they are not is testimony to the degree of flexibility within our national economy that has been built up over time, and to the design of national policies that aim to lessen the more stark differences that might otherwise occur. Those structures have grown up in the context of a system of a national money. Monetary policy is, by design, appropriately a national policy. In conducting it, the Reserve Bank devotes considerable attention to finding out and understanding what is happening at the regional and industry level. That helps us to maintain an overall set of financial conditions that are appropriate for the national economy. But we know that there will always be some differences in how changes to monetary policy are felt (though it is not always to be assumed that these impacts are necessarily greatest in country areas).  Monetary policy can’t make those differences disappear. In the end, however, if monetary policy can help to deliver reasonable macroeconomic stability, that will offer the best chance for any industry, any region, any business or any individual to succeed on their merits. The Reserve Bank, taking account of all the conditions across the various sectors, remains committed to that goal. 
BIS Review 119/2010 1 Grant Spencer: The impact of the global financial crisis on financial policy Summary of remarks by Mr Grant Spencer, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, at the Symposium on Financial Sector Governance, Auckland, 20 September 2010. *      *      * In this presentation, I would like to discuss New Zealand’s financial policy response to the Global Financial Crisis. My focus here will be on permanent changes to policy following the crisis rather than the initial short term “emergency” responses. I will cover financial policies overseen by the Reserve Bank, namely monetary policy, liquidity management and the prudential supervision of banks and non-banks. Monetary policy In New Zealand, monetary policy focuses on the maintenance of price stability. This alone provides no guarantee of economic stability or financial stability. However, the experience in New Zealand and overseas suggests that maintaining price stability over the medium term is the best and most worthwhile contribution monetary policy can make to achieving broader economic and financial stability.  Our inflation targeting framework served us well during the financial crisis and helped guide sensible policy responses. Immediately prior to the crisis, monetary policy in New Zealand had been relatively restrictive with the Reserve Bank increasing the Official Cash Rate (OCR) between 2004 and 2007 in response to elevated inflation pressures associated with a booming housing market. As the global crisis emerged and deepened, we responded by reducing the OCR aggressively. The OCR was cut during 2008 and early 2009 from a high of 8.25 percent to just 2.5 percent. These reductions were appropriate, despite high headline rates of inflation at the time due to record high oil prices. The policy easing was consistent with an outlook for rapidly diminishing inflation pressures as the global and domestic economies turned sharply downwards.  Going forward, medium term price stability will remain the primary objective of monetary policy. However, we expect that monetary policy will have more bite over the next few years than it has had for many years; for a number of reasons: First, following the crisis our banks now face a higher cost of funds. It is now more expensive for them to borrow offshore, which in turn has seen them compete more aggressively for funds raised in the domestic retail deposit market. We currently estimate that the spread of the banks’ average cost of funds over the OCR is some 150 basis points higher than prior to the crisis. This state of affairs is likely to persist for some time. It means that, for any given OCR, the rates the banks charge their customers for lending will be higher than before. Second, the evidence to date suggests that, following the global crisis, households and businesses are considerably less willing to take on new debt. Credit growth remains very subdued. We believe that this diminished appetite for debt will remain for some time as people and companies work to gradually strengthen their financial positions. Third, unlike the situation over much of the past twenty years, New Zealand is now facing an upward sloping yield curve – longer term interest rates are higher than short-term rates. This means that fixed rate mortgages are now more expensive than floating or very short-term fixed rate mortgages. This has seen many borrowers shift back to floating rates over the past two years. As a result, as we move the OCR higher it is likely to have more “bite” than it did previously.  
2 BIS Review 119/2010 Liquidity management As the global financial crisis broke, a key policy response from the Reserve Bank was the expansion of liquidity facilities that we provide to banks and other financial institutions, including a broadening of acceptable collateral instruments. This expansion of facilities was needed to ensure that the financial system remained liquid and that institutions could continue to make payments as required without creating undue stress in the interbank market. In particular, as the banks’ access to global markets became very restricted in late 2008–early 2009, the Reserve Bank provided access to term funding secured over mortgage backed securities. The banks also increased their use of parent funding during this period.  With the crisis behind us, we have been reconsidering the appropriate role and scope of the Reserve Bank’s liquidity facilities. The crisis has demonstrated the value of liquidity support for fundamentally sound institutions in the face of systemic market disruptions. While it is important that institutions provide for their own liquidity in the first instance, it is clear that central bank liquidity facilities are an essential backstop at times when shocks to confidence cause market liquidity to dry up. Key requirements for central bank facilities are that: their pricing encourages a return to normal market trading; they are targeted at system liquidity, not individual institutions; and they are fully collateralised.  In light of the GFC experience and the Bank’s broader mandate to promote the efficiency of the financial system, we intend in the future to adopt a somewhat broader approach to liquidity management than was the case prior to the crisis. The range of securities that we accept as collateral will be wider than in the past in order to help support liquidity in a number of key financial markets. Such markets include: the NZ dollar, Bank bills, NZ Government securities, and local authority/SOE stock. In addition, access to the Bank’s overnight facility will be extended to major NZ dollar settlement systems.  Prudential policy: banks Turning to prudential policy, the global financial crisis has prompted a major review of policy internationally. In New Zealand, the financial crisis highlighted shortcomings in the banks’ management of funding and liquidity rather than credit losses of the sort seen in the major economies. A heavy reliance on short-term foreign borrowing by the NZ banks meant they were vulnerable to the sort of liquidity shock experienced in late 2008–early 09. While the banks’ funding shortfall was met through parent funding and the Reserve Bank’s expanded liquidity facilities, the experience underlined the need for banks to lengthen the maturity of their liabilities relative to assets, in order to reduce their vulnerability to such shocks.  To address these issues, the Reserve Bank introduced a new prudential liquidity policy for banks in April 2010. This policy requires that the banks hold sufficient eligible liquid assets to meet one-week and one-month liquidity mismatch ratio requirements. In addition, the banks must meet a Core Funding Ratio requirement of at least 65 percent. Core funding consists of customer deposits (weighted by size) and market funding of one year or greater to maturity. The Core Funding Ratio requirement will rise to 75 percent by mid 2012. The banks have already made good progress in lifting their Core Funding Ratios to be well in excess of the 65 percent minimum requirement.  Internationally, the moves to strengthen banking regulation are being led by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), made up of banking supervisors from the major economies and convened by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BCBS has developed a number of proposals under the broad “Basel 3” label which are expected to be agreed at the upcoming G-20 meeting in November. The proposals are focussed on strengthening banks’ minimum capital and liquidity requirements. These include higher Tier 1 capital requirements, a greater emphasis on common equity in Tier 1 capital, and a leverage ratio to act as a backstop to the risk weighted capital regime. Other proposals include more explicit liquidity requirements (similar to those described above for New Zealand), 
BIS Review 119/2010 3 arrangements for greater international coordination of supervision and revisions to international financial accounting standards. The crisis has shown that existing accounting standards are problematic for financial institutions in a number of areas such as mark-to-market asset valuations and provisioning rules for loan losses.  Another area to receive attention under Basel 3 is the possible use of macro-prudential policy adjustments to help counter pro-cyclical behaviour in financial systems. The BCBS has proposed that banks be required to build up additional capital buffers at times of rapid credit growth that could then be drawn down in times of stress. The intention of the instrument would be to lessen the impact on the economy when the boom turns to bust as well as possibly constraining excessive credit growth. A number of central banks, including the RBNZ, are also looking at other macro-prudential tools that could possibly be used to help limit the extremities of the credit cycle. The challenge here is to find instruments that will actually work without imposing major efficiency costs on the financial system. Prudential policy: non banks New Zealand’s non-bank deposit taking sector comprises a number of different institutional types. The savings institutions (building societies, credit unions and the PSIS) have generally weathered the crisis well. The finance company sector, on the other hand, has faced considerable upheaval over the period since 2006, with only about a third of the companies in early 2006 now remaining active. While the Global Financial Crisis added to the difficulties faced by the finance companies, the sector’s issues have been largely home-grown as a result of poor lending decisions, particularly with respect to property development lending, and inadequate capital support. While the Crown retail deposit guarantee scheme has provided some liquidity protection for the sector, allowing time for the sounder institutions to rebuild investor confidence, the companies that have been unable to recapitalise or restructure have ultimately been forced to exit the industry. An amendment to the Reserve Bank Act in late 2008 saw the Reserve Bank become the new prudential regulator of the non-bank deposit taking sector; with trustees remaining the front line supervisors. Since then the Reserve Bank has been developing a new regulatory framework and phasing in the new prudential requirements. Key elements include mandatory credit ratings, connected lending limits, an 8 percent minimum capital requirement, and fit and proper tests for senior managers and directors. While these reforms are clearly too late to avert the negative consequences of earlier finance company practices, the overall aim is to raise safety standards in the sector so that the remaining players are more resilient to future business cycles. Conclusion The Global Financial Crisis had major effects on the NZ financial system and economy. It prompted responses across the full range of Reserve Bank policies, including monetary policy, liquidity management and prudential policies. Many of these responses were short term in nature but there have also been important long term policy consequences. Indeed, in the prudential policy area, there is significant policy change still yet to come from the strengthening of international standards under the “Basel 3” initiative. Most of the permanent policy changes undertaken by the Reserve Bank have related to liquidity: requiring banks to better protect themselves against liquidity shocks; and recognising a somewhat broader role for the Reserve Bank in supporting financial system liquidity in times of stress. This should not be surprising given that the dominant transmission channel for the Global financial Crisis was an unprecedented reduction in global financial system liquidity. 
BIS Review 118/2010 1 Daniel K Tarullo: Comments on “Regulating the shadow banking system” Speech by Mr Daniel K Tarullo, Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, Washington DC, 17 September 2010. *      *      * Broadly speaking, threats to financial stability can arise in two ways: first, through the rapid deterioration or failure of a large institution with leverage sufficient to have widespread knock-on effects and, second, through the breakdown of a significant market in which large numbers of leveraged actors depend upon similar sources of liquidity and, importantly, backup liquidity in periods of stress. These two sources of systemic risk can be, and usually are, related. In fact, the severity of the recent crisis might be explained as an explosive combination of the two. But the different origins of risk call for different or, perhaps more precisely, complementary, policy responses.1 To date, reform in financial regulation and supervision has focused mainly on large regulated institutions: Three examples are the just-announced Basel III capital rules, much of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the Federal Reserve’s revamping of its large holding company supervision. Of course, attention has also been paid to the second source of systemic risk, notably in Dodd-Frank’s provisions for prudential supervision of payments, clearing, and settlement systems. But more will need to be done in this area, particularly as new constraints applicable to large regulated institutions push more activity into the unregulated sector.  This paper by Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick, “Regulating the Shadow Banking System” (G-M), fits squarely within this enterprise. It builds on two important insights from work Gorton had pursued well before the financial crisis began: First, that the enormous growth of the shadow banking system generally, and the repurchase agreement, or “repo,” market specifically, depended on the engineering of AAA-rated securities that led participants to believe they did not need to inquire into the soundness of the underlying collateral. This financial engineering largely succeeded in insulating participants from idiosyncratic risk. But when the value of whole classes of the underlying collateral was drawn into serious question, initially by the collapse of the subprime housing market, participants’ lack of information about the collateral they held led to a shattering of confidence in all the collateral.  In the absence of the regulation and government backstop that have applied to the traditional banking system since the Depression, a run on assets in the entire repo market ensued. The resulting forced sale of assets into an illiquid market turned many illiquid institutions into insolvent ones. The fallout has been such that, to this day, the amount of repo funding available for non-agency, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, high-yield corporate bonds, and other instruments backed by assets with any degree of risk remains substantially below its pre-Lehman levels.  The second Gorton insight on which this paper builds is the importance of statutory franchise value for the business model viability of at least some kinds of regulated financial entities. Where competition from unregulated entities is permitted, explicitly or de facto, capital and other requirements imposed on regulated firms may shrink margins enough to make them unattractive to investors. The result, as we have seen in the past, will be some combination of regulatory arbitrage, assumption of higher risk in permitted activities, and exit from the                                                  1  The views presented here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee. Tom King and Michael Palumbo of the Board’s staff contributed to these remarks. 
2 BIS Review 118/2010 industry. Each of these outcomes at least potentially undermines the original motivation for the regulation.  The G-M paper provides a concrete, though in some respects not fully elaborated, proposal to remedy the information problem in the repo market through creation of statutory franchise value for what G-M calls Narrow Funding Banks (NFBs). These banks would be “narrow” in that their only assets would be asset-backed securities (ABS) and very high quality instruments such as Treasuries. They would, it appears, make their money from the income streams associated with the ABS. They would raise the funds to purchase ABS through debt issuance and, most significantly for the proposal, the repo market, in which the collateral offered would be liabilities of the NFBs. The government would regulate the NFBs directly, as it does all banks, but also by setting requirements for the ABS that could be bought by the NFBs. This regulation is intended to provide market confidence in the liabilities of the NFBs, which would be further buttressed by NFB access to the discount window.  A key feature of the proposal is that, by law, only NFBs could buy securitized assets. The consequent franchise value would compensate NFBs for the costs they incur because they can hold only high-quality securities, are subject to supervision and prudential requirements, and have to operate in a highly transparent fashion. In essence, ABS-backed repo funding would be limited to NFBs.  The first two questions I would pose about this creative policy proposal are the most basic: What problem is it supposed to solve, and how does the breadth of the remedy align with that problem? Given their analysis of the breakdown of the repo market, Gorton and Metrick’s answer might be self-evident: The G-M proposal aims to solve the information problems that increased the risk from maturity transformation associated with ABS repo funding. This, of course, is not solving for the entire shadow banking system, though an effective plan for reforming the ABS repo market would be a major accomplishment in itself.2 But in proposing a solution to this problem, G-M would significantly restrict all asset-backed securitization. While it is obvious that too much credit was created through ABS and associated instruments in the years preceding the crisis, it seems at least reasonable to question whether the best policy response is this dramatic a change in the regulatory environment. One wonders, for example, if it is desirable to forbid anyone but NFBs from buying ABS, particularly if there are investors interested in holding these assets regardless of their utility in repo arrangements. The severe problems now associated with ABS began with assets held by mismatched entities like structured investment vehicles or financial institutions engaged in capital arbitrage under Basel II, not those held by end investors.  A variant on this initial question is how much the legal environment for securitization should be changed in order to provide a source of stable short-term liquidity in wholesale funding markets. Limiting securitization purchases to NFBs will surely result in some tailoring of ABS to the business models of NFBs, an outcome that might not be identical to a securitization market tailored to the funding needs of lenders providing credit to businesses and consumers. Also, as I will explain later, the G-M proposal would require non-trivial changes in bank regulatory policy, as well as the significant extension of discount window access to a new kind of institution. All this would be in pursuit of a mechanism for generating large amounts of liquidity. A cost-benefit discussion is probably needed at the outset, with careful specification of the benefits of the repo market that G-M are trying to save, weighed against the likely impact on – among other things – the securitization market and regulatory system.  A second set of questions concerns how the NFBs would operate in practice. As a threshold matter, it is worth noting that policymakers may find the proposal to have a certain binary                                                  2  For a survey of the entire shadow banking system, see Pozsar, Zoltan, Tobian Adrian, Adam Ashcraft, and Hayley Boesky (July 2010): “Shadow Banking,” (928 KB PDF) Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Reports, no. 458. 
BIS Review 118/2010 3 quality. That is, it would structurally change the entire securitization market and a large portion of the repo market essentially overnight. In effect, G-M put all securitization eggs into one basket. If the new system worked well, the benefits presumably would be significant, and perhaps quickly realized. Indeed, the new system might succeed in helping to restart, on a sounder basis, various ABS submarkets that remain largely dormant three years after the crisis began to unfold.3 If, on the other hand, the new system encountered major difficulties, there might be materially reduced adaptive capacity in other financial actors, possibly for a considerable period.  One obvious source of difficulty is the possibility, well recognized by G-M, that the business model mandated for NFBs might not be viable and stable. As with all forms of narrow banks proposed over the years, NFBs as a group would seem likely to generate relatively low revenues, given the low risk of the securities in which they would have to invest. G-M propose to counter this problem by granting franchise value through the statutory monopoly on securitization mentioned earlier and through access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Picking up on their analogy to the creation of deposit insurance in the 1930s, the monopoly on securitization is intended to help offset the regulatory costs imposed on NFBs in the same way that the monopoly on the “business of banking” was intended to offset the regulatory costs imposed on insured depository institutions.  Unlike the business environment for banks in the 1930s, however, securitization and repo lending are national – if not international – activities, with little to suggest that any advantage would be derived from local knowledge. It seems quite possible that the economies of scale associated with the NFB model are sufficiently high that the industry structure would tend toward oligopoly, or even monopoly. That is, too much franchise value might be created. In that event, there would be significant additions to the cost side of the proposal’s ledger, in the form of the price and quantity effects that result from non-competitive industry structures.  Regardless of the eventual structure of the industry, NFBs essentially would be monolines, with highly correlated risk exposures. They could be particularly vulnerable to funding difficulties in times of deteriorating credit conditions. Yet by the terms of the G-M proposal, they apparently would not be able to hedge interest rate or other risks. G-M propose giving NFBs access to the discount window to forestall liquidity problems and runs on the NFBs, presumably in the same way that deposit insurance stopped runs on traditional banks. Here again though, the analogy is not a perfect one. While banks and their depositors are assured that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will keep the latter whole in the event of the former’s failure, the Federal Reserve does not make binding commitments to lend to any institution and actively discourages reliance on the window for regular funding.  A third question about the G-M proposal arises because of the significant changes in current law and practice that would be required were the proposal to be adopted. The prohibition on ABS holdings by anyone other than NFBs is the obvious and major example. But there are several others: In addition to the possibly problematic features of discount window lending in general for the proposal, the Federal Reserve has traditionally opened the window to non-depository institutions only in particularly stressed conditions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, any use of credit ratings in federal regulations will be prohibited, an obvious complication to the G-M proposal. This part of Dodd-Frank has accelerated and expanded the efforts already underway at the federal banking agencies to lessen regulatory reliance on ratings. In truth, it may pose no greater challenge for the G-M proposal than for many existing capital rules.4                                                  3  The relative dormancy of these markets is also due in part to the limited supply of the loans needed to feed the securitization process. 4  For a discussion of some of the issues raised in the context of capital requirements, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Alternatives to the Use of Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking Agencies,” Joint Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (August 10). 
4 BIS Review 118/2010 Still, it may require extension of G-M’s confidence that the regulator could adequately oversee ABS ratings to confidence that it could assign ratings in the first place. I would observe that the substantial effort expended by staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to evaluate the creditworthiness of a relatively small number of securitizations in the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility suggests the enormity of that task. Furthermore, the wisdom of having a government agency – even the independent central bank – assume such a permanent, central role in credit allocation should at least be subject to debate.  A final regulatory issue is raised by another G-M response to their expectation that equity returns for NFBs will be lower than for traditional banks. In place of the equity capital requirements generally applicable to banking organizations, G-M propose that NFBs would issue capital notes that are debt-like except in periods of stress, when they would convert to equity. In essence, all of an NFB’s capital would be contingent capital. While contingent capital is an item on the financial regulatory agenda, it is considered a possible supplement to common equity, not a substitute for it. In this respect, the G-M proposal moves in the opposite direction from Basel III, which has followed markets in making common equity the centerpiece of capital evaluation and requirements.5 These inconsistencies with current law and practice in the G-M proposal do not themselves argue against its soundness. They do, however, underscore the degree to which the NFBs would require development of a new financial regulatory approach, as well as a restructuring of the ABS and repo markets.  More generally, the existence of costs or problems does not counsel the rejection of the proposal as such. In the face of very real flaws in the pre-crisis state of these markets, and the failure of some ABS markets to recover, even where it seems they could function sensibly, there is a very good case for a policy initiative. So let me consider briefly whether variants on the basic G-M approach might retain its core benefits while addressing some of its potential problems.  One possibility would be to broaden the permissible ownership of NFBs to include bank holding companies. This modification would make the most sense if one believed that the basic G-M approach was promising but that the risks of either an untenable business model or high industry concentration, and consequent anti-competitive effects, were high. It is possible that a number of large, diversified financial holding companies would find an NFB a viable part of their operations. G-M require that NFBs be stand-alone entities, and specifically prohibit ownership by commercial banks in an effort to avoid implicit contractual guarantees. This is a legitimate concern, to be sure, but one that might be at least imperfectly addressed through specific restrictions on relationships between affiliates in a bank holding company. The relevant comparison is thus between the residual costs of the regulated relationship and the effects of an anti-competitive industry structure.  A second variant on the G-M approach, also motivated by industry structure problems, would be to turn NFBs from privately owned public utilities (as G-M describe them) to actual public utilities. However, the extent to which this change in ownership structure would ameliorate the anti-competitive problems is uncertain. Moreover, the concerns mentioned earlier with respect to government judgments on credit allocation would remain, even if they are provided another layer of insulation through the device of a government corporation. In addition, of course, the history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a cautionary tale of the potential for a government monopoly with a conservative mandate to expand its operation into much riskier activities.                                                   5  It also seems likely that the kinds of quantitative liquidity requirements currently under development by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision would be difficult for NFBs to satisfy. 
BIS Review 118/2010 5 At first glance, then, it is not at all clear that structural modifications to the basic G-M approach would be preferable to the proposal as they have described it. Options that depart from the G-M approach would need to find different ways of solving the information problems that G-M identify. Let me briefly speculate about possible alternatives that would use regulatory requirements to create a class of ABS in which markets could, without inquiry into the nature and quality of the underlying assets, have confidence even in periods of stress. One way, of course, would be to follow more closely the deposit insurance analogy by establishing an insurance system. G-M suggest that an insurance system for the repo market would be impractical, question whether insuring collateral (i.e., certain classes of securitized assets) would be sustainable without creating franchise value, and worry that the creation of franchise value through limiting entry into securitization would, in their words, “limit the amount of money created.” Yet, as I suggested earlier, the G-M proposal itself might constrain securitization in undesirable ways, both related and unrelated to repo transactions.  In addressing the franchise value issue, it would be interesting to pursue an important idea that G-M mention, but which is not at the center of their proposal: making the repo bankruptcy exception available only where the collateral conforms to certain criteria established by law or regulation. Given the demand for repo funding, it seems worth considering whether this device could be used to create the necessary franchise value. Indeed, if this approach had promise, it might be feasible for a regulatory body to establish the requisite criteria without providing insurance. With or without insurance, the “franchise value” might attach more to the instrument than to an institution.  There is not time here to enumerate the potential difficulties with these ideas, but they are not hard to discern, even as stated in such skeletal form. In common with the G-M proposal, they would require a level of expertise and involvement in credit rating by the government that could pose practical and, in some conceivable alternatives, policy concerns. In any case, these are thoughts for further discussion, rather than developed options. Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick have, in setting forth this proposal, continued to shape our understanding of the role and risks of the shadow banking system, as well as to add a specific proposal to our menu of possible responses.  
BIS Review 118/2010 1 Axel A Weber: Growth prospects after the crisis Speech by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the 21st European Business School (EBS) Symposium, Oestrich-Winkel, 17 September 2010. *      *      * 1. Introduction Professor Jahns, Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to have been asked to assume the patronage of the 21st EBS Symposium and thus to have the opportunity to speak to you today. Occasions like this which provide a platform for students to meet professionals are an agreeable complement to academic study. This symposium has traditionally been organised by first-year students who, I must say, appear to have done very well in performing their task.  2. Growth and the financial system – some general remarks The topic of this year’s symposium is “Growth – A Future Without Boundaries”. Economic growth is widely associated or even equated with prosperity, and in light of the current crisis the topic is receiving a lot of attention: After all, the crisis not only resulted in the most pronounced downturn since World War II, for many it also cast doubt on the path of economic activity once the crisis is over. Nevertheless, if we wish to make a sound and comprehensive judgement it is not advisable to look only at current gross domestic product (GDP). Economic growth is a concept that embraces a longer-term perspective and we would be well advised to look beyond the current crisis. The concept of potential output permits a calm and objective view of the matter. Abstracting from cyclical fluctuations, it covers the medium to long-term trend of GDP and links it to the driving factors for such a time horizon. To be more specific and to focus our minds on the lasting economic impact of the crisis, it helps to take a simple textbook model of economic growth as a starting point. In this stylised model, growth is determined by three factors: capital, labour and technical progress. How are these three factors, in turn, affected by the financial system? The first factor – capital – points perhaps most obviously to the importance of the financial system. After all, the financial sector is not only a part of the economy with a distinct value added, it also plays a crucial role in capital accumulation. However, especially in highly developed economies that typically boast sizeable and sophisticated financial sectors, the role of the financial system goes far beyond that of mere capital accumulation. In such economies, the financial system plays a key role in identifying and funding innovations, thus helping to advance the state of technical knowledge and promoting technological progress. For these reasons – and leaving aside additional effects due to the labour force and investment in human capital – an efficient financial system is indispensable for growth and necessarily becomes more complex with each advancing stage of economic development. In a sense, even the crisis with its massive repercussions for the real economy and its enormous costs illustrates how important the financial system and its stability are for economic performance and welfare. Consequently, financial stability has become a top priority on the global policy agenda. But stability is not an end in itself. Historical record tells us that financial crises have always been an element of market economies. Therefore, the objective should not be to avoid them entirely but rather to contain their consequences. Put differently, the challenge for regulatory reforms is to strike the right balance between the stability of the financial system and its efficiency. And, given the experience of the past few years as well as the channels through which the financial system affects economic growth, 
2 BIS Review 118/2010 the two objectives are, to a significant degree, complementary. This means that the trade-off between stability and efficiency should not be seen as a zero-sum game. Well-designed regulatory reform should make the financial system more stable without cutting into sustainable growth.  3. The crisis, regulatory reform and future growth The strength and scale of the financial crisis were unforeseeable. There had been warnings about various exaggerations and undesirable developments. But perceptions of where these might lead fell well short of the reality when it actually materialised. Prior to the crisis, the global economy had been growing at a rapid pace. This was due, not least, to the fact that emerging markets were becoming increasingly integrated. This set free a large labour potential, provided high-yielding investment opportunities, and led to significant growth in per capita income. Another driving factor behind growth was less benign, however. In too many areas, capital was not always channelled into the most productive areas. Consider the housing market in some advanced economies as a point in case. An environment in which interest rates were exceptionally low as well as loopholes and weaknesses in the regulatory framework acted as catalysts for these undesirable and, ultimately, unsustainable developments. Eventually, the underlying imbalances erupted and suddenly came to the surface – with the well-known costs. The situation in which the global economy found itself was comparable to a rose bush that had sprouted too many new buds too quickly. The new rosebuds had many attractive blossoms but as soon as it started to rain, most of them had no support and broke off. Against this background, what are the deficiencies of the financial system that have to be remedied? At the microeconomic level, a whole cocktail of different factors led to the financial crisis. These included a general lack of transparency, insufficient capital buffers, the development of a scarcely regulated shadow banking system, and moral hazard in various forms – owing to ill-designed remuneration schemes, for example, or insufficient risk and liquidity management at the level of individual institutions. At the macroeconomic level, in particular, the pivotal role of certain agents and their influence on financial markets – in other words, their systematic importance – was underestimated for too long. In order to prevent the rose bush from sprouting too many weak buds and blossoms again, reforms at both the micro and macro levels are needed to make the financial system more resilient to future shocks. As a first line of defence, the microprudential level of regulation needs to be strengthened. The measures that have been proposed include higher capital and liquidity requirements. These are intended to lower the probability of an institution’s insolvency by enabling it to cope better with losses. Proposals for reform were published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2009. The discussion is well advanced. A final proposal was adopted last weekend, and the G20 meeting in November will yield a final decision. As a result, financial institutions will be requested to hold not only a higher quantity of capital in their books but also capital of increased quality: minimum core capital requirements will go up from 2% to 4.5%, for Tier 1 capital from the current 4% to 6%. This will be supplemented by an additional buffer of 2.5% built up of common equity. This is designed to enable banks to absorb losses during periods of economic and financial disruptions. Furthermore, a stricter definition of core capital will be applied. Yet, this first line of defence needs to be supplemented. In a market-based economy it is neither possible nor desirable to entirely prevent the failure of individual enterprises. Thus, a second line of defence has to be drawn at the macroprudential level of regulation in order to contain the impact of individual bank failures on the financial system as a whole and to make the financial system more transparent. This part of the reform process is being dealt with by the FSB. Major topics on its agenda are the handling of systemically important financial institutions and the “too-big-too-fail” problem, resolution regimes, the role of rating agencies, 
BIS Review 118/2010 3 harmonising accounting standards, and rolling back trading in OTC derivatives. Even though these issues seem to have attracted less attention than Basel III, I am confident that we shall see significant progress in this area by the time of the G20 meeting in November as well. Once implemented, the reforms at the microprudential and the macroprudential levels will have a profound impact on the financial system, increasing its resilience and hence its stability significantly. But, going back to what I said earlier, do the reforms also strike the right balance between stability and growth? I am certain they do. True, the development of the new Basel III proposals has been accompanied by concerns that such tighter regulation might have a negative impact on economic performance by severely restricting access to credit. Several studies on the potential effects of the new regulatory requirements on the economy have been published recently. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis has revealed that such fears of a significant negative impact on growth are unfounded. This is all the more the case given that there will be the transition period before the new requirements enter fully into force, which will give banks sufficient time to strengthen their capital base. This favourable overall assessment of the macroeconomic impact of well-designed regulatory reform highlights the fact that there is no inherent conflict between the G20 agenda’s objectives of a more stable financial system and of ensuring strong and sustainable growth. And, in terms of the general future outlook for growth, we should bear in mind that the financial crisis has not impaired major drivers of growth. Emerging markets, for instance, will still make great efforts to catch up, and technical progress will continue. Thus, the crisis certainly does not mark the end of economic growth. Rather, what it has done is highlight the importance of sustainable growth and the need for supportive policies – in financial regulation, but also in many other policy areas. 4. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the events and implications of the current financial crisis have clearly demonstrated how vulnerable our financial system has been. The necessity of reform cannot be denied, financial stability has to and will be reinforced. However, as said earlier, enhancing financial stability is not an end in itself nor is it an obstacle to growth. Rather, it is a major prerequisite. Regulatory reform along the lines currently proposed lowers the probability of crises occurring as well as their impact, but does not unduly hamper access to funding for consumers and firms. The outcome will be a significant improvement in welfare in the long run. Thank you for your attention. 
 BIS Review 117/2010 1 Philip Lowe: The development of Asia – risk and returns for Australia Speech by Mr Philip Lowe, Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, NatStats 2010 Conference, Sydney, 16 September 2010.  *      *      * I would like to thank Adam Cagliarini for his assistance in preparing this talk. It is a pleasure for me to be able to support the work of the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) by participating in this year’s NatStats Conference. The conference itself is evidence of the ABS’s commitment to high-quality statistics. It is also evidence of the Bureau’s commitment to making sure that its statistics remain relevant as the economy evolves over the years ahead.  Today, I would like to talk about that expected evolution and some of the issues that it raises.  My central thesis has two elements. The first is that the medium-term prospects for the Australian economy look to be more positive than they did some years back. This is partly the result of policy choices that have been made within Australia, but it also reflects the development of the economies in Asia. The second element is that as Australia’s medium-term prospects have improved, the risks facing the economy have also changed and these risks need to be managed. In my time today, I would like to explore both these elements.  The medium term and the development of Asia As is now well understood, Australia has come through the global downturn in good shape. Not only has the business cycle here been relatively muted compared with elsewhere, but our medium-term prospects look to be brighter than those of most other advanced economies. They also look brighter than they did a decade ago.  For many years it seemed that Australia was inexorably slipping down the global league tables. The prices of our exports were gradually falling relative to the prices of our imports, and there was little optimism that this would change. And it was only a decade ago that Australia was viewed by some as an old-fashioned, low-tech economy, relying on its natural resources instead of developing new technologies.  Today, things look quite different. While there are continuing uncertainties about the near-term outlook, there is more optimism about medium-term prospects than there has been for some time. The prices of commodities have risen substantially. Investment in Australia is high and Australian assets are again viewed as attractive by international investors.  I have talked on previous occasions about the factors that helped Australia through the global downturn and I don’t plan to revisit those today. Rather, I want to focus on why this change in perceptions about medium-term prospects has occurred and, in particular, the role that the development of Asia has played.  At a general level, the importance of Asia to Australia is now well understood. Despite this, it remains the case that the financial news from the United States and Europe dominates our newspapers and our airwaves. With this constant flow of information about the North Atlantic, it is sometimes easy to forget just how profound – and important to Australia – are the structural changes taking place in Asia.  Two of these changes are particularly important. These are the twin processes of urbanisation and industrialisation. As the countries of Asia have urbanised and industrialised, the demand for infrastructure has grown very strongly. When people move to the cities, new dwellings need to be built, and as living standards rise, so too does the quality of dwellings 
 2 BIS Review 117/2010 constructed. The growth of urban centres also requires the building of communication and transport networks, with the demand for roads, bridges, railways etc rising.  All this development requires raw materials. In particular, it requires steel to build the apartments in which the new city dwellers live and to build the infrastructure that supports those cities. For example, a typical 90m2 apartment in China requires about six tonnes of steel, and 10km of metropolitan subway requires around 75,000 tonnes. On average, every tonne of steel that is produced requires around 1.7 tonnes of iron ore and over half a tonne of coking coal, and Australia is in the fortunate position of having ample low-cost, high-quality supplies of both. And with higher energy consumption also a feature of industrialisation, we are in the fortunate position of having large reserves of natural gas.  Not surprisingly, the strong growth in demand for raw materials in Asia has led to a large increase in the price of raw materials over the past decade. As a result, Australia’s terms of trade have increased very significantly and are now at their highest level since the spike in the early 1950s when wool prices soared due to the Korean War (Graph 1).  Graph 1  These higher prices have raised the return to capital in the Australian resources sector, and the result has been a very large increase in investment. Indeed, Australia has become one of the high-investment countries of the developed world, with the stock of physical capital estimated to have increased at an average rate of around 5 per cent over recent years. By way of contrast, in many other advanced economies, including the United States, the level of investment has been only a little above that needed to offset the depreciation of the existing capital stock (Graph 2).  
 BIS Review 117/2010 3 Graph 2  When discussing the impact of Asia on Australia over recent years, the focus has rightly been on China. The transformation that has been occurring there is truly remarkable and it is reshaping the global economy. Over the past three decades, the proportion of the Chinese population living in urban centres has more than doubled to almost 45 per cent (Graph 3). While there have been a couple of historical examples of other countries urbanising as quickly, the sheer number of people migrating to urban centres is unprecedented in human history – over the past 30 years, nearly 400 million Chinese citizens (almost 20 times the population of Australia) have moved to cities. As a result, there are now around 170 Chinese cities with more than a million residents, compared with only around 35 in Europe. And the urbanisation process still has quite a long way to run, with another 300 to 400 million people expected to move from the country to the city over the next 20 years.  Graph 3  These developments in China are being closely observed in Australia, including at the Reserve Bank. A decade or so ago, we spent a lot of time puzzling over why quarterly 
 4 BIS Review 117/2010 movements in Australian GDP were so highly correlated with quarterly movements in US GDP. We don’t puzzle over this anymore – not because we solved the puzzle, but because the correlation has fallen (Graph 4). At the same time, the correlation between quarterly movements in Australian and Chinese GDP has steadily increased. Clearly what happens in the Australian economy is now more dependent upon what happens in China than has been the case at any time in our past.  Graph 4  But as we think about the future, the story is broader than China. Over the years ahead, the Indian economy, which also contains more than 20 per cent of the world’s population within its borders, is likely to become increasingly important to Australia. After India grew at a disappointing pace in the 1960s and 1970s, growth has picked up over recent decades, averaging 7 per cent per year over the 2000s (Graph 5). The economy has gradually opened up to foreign trade and capital, and government influence over investment decisions has been scaled back. While India will inevitably follow a different development path to that of China, the prospects for sustained solid growth look to be better than they have for many years.  Graph 5  
 BIS Review 117/2010 5 Like China, India too is urbanising. The process though is more gradual, with the number of people moving to urban areas over the past 30 years less than half that in China (Graph 3). Despite India’s population currently being only marginally lower than China’s, it has about 40 cities with a population of over 1 million, compared with China’s 170 or so. This lower rate of urbanisation partly reflects the fact that India has not industrialised as quickly as China.  As I mentioned a few moments ago, as people move to cities the demand for steel tends to rise. Not surprisingly, in China consumption of steel has more than quadrupled since 1997, with just over half of current steel consumption accounted for by the construction sector (Graph 6).1 Indian steel consumption has also grown, but not nearly as quickly. However, the experience of China and that of other countries that have urbanised hints at the potential growth in India. While at the moment, the bulk of the Indian population live in rural areas and investment in infrastructure has been relatively low, there is the potential for this to change over the years ahead, just as it has in China over the past 30 years. If this does indeed occur then the demand for raw materials – and steel, in particular – is likely to be very strong over coming decades.  Graph 6  The impact of Chinese and Indian development is not just confined to the resources sector though. As countries develop and living standards rise not only does the demand for steel increase, but so does the demand for higher-quality food, and consumption of protein increases. Again, the comparison of China and India is instructive (Graph 7). As income per head in China has grown over the past 30 years, protein consumption per head has also risen strongly, almost doubling over this period. Protein consumption has also risen in India, although the increases have been much smaller due to slower growth in income per head and differences in dietary preferences.                                                   1  China’s share of world steel consumption has increased from 15 per cent in 1997 to 44 per cent in 2009. 
 6 BIS Review 117/2010 Graph 7  Again, over the years ahead it is quite likely that global demand for protein will grow strongly, particularly if India and China continue on their current paths. With Australia’s strong history of agricultural production, this is another area where we have an advantage.  The overall impact of this growth and urbanisation of Asia can be clearly seen in Australia’s international trade statistics. The four largest markets for our exports in 2009 were China, Japan, India and South Korea (Graph 8). Over the first half of 2010, around 22 per cent of Australia’s exports receipts have come from China and a further 8 per cent from India. These shares have been trending higher for some time and this is likely to continue over the medium term. There has also been a large increase in the share of resources in Australia’s total exports. A decade ago, iron ore and coal together accounted for around 10 per cent of Australia’s total exports (Graph 9). In contrast, over the past six months, this share has been around one third, with total resource exports accounting for 55 per cent of aggregate export revenue, up from around 35 per cent in the 1990s.  Graph 8  
 BIS Review 117/2010 7 Graph 9  These changes in the country and product composition of our exports are very large. They are also likely to be persistent given that Asian development still has some years to run. This development means that, in aggregate, the Australian economy has the potential to do very well over the years ahead. Conditions are, however likely to differ substantially across sectors of the economy. If past experience is any guide, the growth of the resources sector will have positive spin-off effects for some industries, and rising real incomes will increase demand for a wide range of goods and services. Other industries though will find conditions more difficult due to the level of the exchange rate and the competition for labour and capital. While these differences across sectors will create some challenges, the overall medium-term outlook for the economy is a positive one.  The changing risks and risk management I would now like to turn to the second element of my thesis – that just as the medium-term outlook has changed, so too have the risks, and these risks need to be managed.  One obvious way that the risks have changed is that the economy is more dependent than it has been in the past upon the performance of the Chinese economy and the resources sector, and I suspect that we will be saying the same thing about the Indian economy some years down the track. While, this is generally a good news story, both China and India face significant challenges over the years ahead. In China, the authorities face the difficult task of rebalancing growth away from exports and investment to domestic consumption. And in India, the burden of red-tape remains a major issue and ways need to be found to improve the country’s infrastructure if the economy’s potential is to be unlocked.  It would be unrealistic to assume that the growth paths in these countries will be without bumps, perhaps large ones. And these bumps will have an impact upon Australia. Nor can we assume that commodity prices will remain at their current elevated levels. New sources of supply are being discovered and developed, and there is always the possibility of new technologies reducing the demand for Australia’s main resource exports.  There is very little we can do about these external risks. But what we can do is to have the right policy framework in place so that we can respond when things inevitably turn out differently to what we expect.  There are four aspects of risk management that I would like to talk about. The first is ensuring that productivity growth is strong. The second is ensuring that the economy retains 
 8 BIS Review 117/2010 its flexibility. The third is the way investment is financed. And the fourth is the rate at which national consumption increases in response to the improved medium-term outlook.  First, the importance of productivity growth. Regardless of how things develop in the countries to our north, increasing productivity in Australia remains the key to sustained increases in our living standards. Ensuring that we continue to make progress here provides insurance against the possibility that developments in Asia do not turn out as positively as we expect.  If we look back over recent years, we see that productivity growth has slowed. Since 2001, output per hour worked has increased at just over 1 per cent per year compared with over 2 per cent per year in the 1990s (Graph 10). This slowdown has occurred despite a significant rise in the economy’s overall capital-labour ratio, which would typically be expected to boost average output per hour worked.  Normally, slower rates of productivity growth would lead to slower increases in average living standards. But this has not occurred. Indeed, over the past decade, growth in gross national income per hour worked has been unusually strong, averaging almost 2¾ per cent per year. The reason for this is that the prices of Australia’s exports have risen relative to the prices of our imports, lifting the purchasing power of Australia’s national income. With the proceeds of a tonne of iron ore we now can buy more LCD TVs and domestic services than we could a decade ago. This has allowed our living standards to increase at a faster pace than if we had to rely on productivity growth alone.  Graph 10  Looking forward, this situation cannot continue indefinitely. Over the next few years, commodity prices are likely to decline somewhat from their current very high levels and this will put the focus back onto productivity growth and economic reform as the drivers of increasing living standards.  The second issue is the importance of ensuring that the economy remains flexible, and can respond to unexpected developments. My colleagues at the Reserve Bank and I have spoken at length on previous occasions about the key elements here. Having a flexible exchange rate has been one of the great stabilising forces in the Australian economy over the past 30 years. Labour market flexibility is also important. So too is retaining the flexibility of both monetary and fiscal policy to respond quickly to unexpected developments. To this list, I would add the importance of having a highly trained and educated workforce. Not only does education help lift productivity, but it also makes the economy more flexible and this helps lower risk.  
 BIS Review 117/2010 9 The third element that affects the nature of the risks is the way that investment is financed. Historically, much of the external funding for business investment has come from banks. While bank financing is likely to remain important for many firms, a greater share of investment is likely to be financed from other sources than has been the case in the recent past. This may not be welcome news for the banks, but having investment financed from a variety of different sources helps reduce aggregate risk. Over the years ahead, foreign direct investment and capital market raisings by firms in the resources sector are both likely to play a more important role than they have over the past decade. This means that some of the risks – and, of course, some of the expected returns – from the rapid increase in Australia’s capital stock will be shared with foreign investors.  The fourth element of risk management is the response of domestic consumption to the improved outlook.  The textbook says that if future income prospects improve, the level of national consumption – either private or public – should increase now. But the textbook also says that the lower our appetite for risk, or the greater the uncertainty about the future, the smaller should be any immediate adjustment in consumption. It also says that the more uncomfortable we are about the possibility of a future decline in consumption if things do not work out well, the smaller should be adjustment now.  If we look back at our own economic history, the early 1980s provides a good example of what can happen if the adjustment is too quick. In the first couple of years of that decade, there was much optimism about the future of the resources sector, largely reflecting the rise in oil prices as a result of OPEC II. This optimism was translated quickly into higher wages and increased spending, and the economy grew strongly for a while. But, the optimism turned out to be short lived and the result was a significant hangover, which required a substantial adjustment in spending and real wages over the following years.  By way of contrast, the current experience looks quite different. Despite the considerable optimism about the future, household spending has been relatively restrained over the past couple of years and the appetite for debt has declined. Partly as a result, the pace of household borrowing has slowed significantly (Graph 11). One interpretation of this is that the household sector, after having increased its debt levels for many years and witnessed the problems elsewhere in the world, has a better appreciation of the risks.  Graph 11  
 10 BIS Review 117/2010 If this interpretation is correct it is likely to be a good thing from a risk-management perspective. I say this for two reasons. First, restraint now provides some insurance against the possibility that things do not work out as well as expected. In doing so, it can help lower the probability that costly adjustments will be required at some point in the future. Second, given that there is currently a relatively limited amount of spare capacity in the economy, the risk of upwards pressure on inflation would be increased if investment and consumption were both to increase very strongly over the next few years.  In summary then, while we can do little to control the external environment that Australia faces, the choices that we make on productivity, flexibility, financing and national consumption will influence the overall risk-profile of the Australian economy. So while we look forward with considerable optimism about our medium-term prospects, we also need to be alert to the risks and how we might best manage them.  Conclusion I would like to close with just a couple of observations on what all this means for the collection of statistics.  First, we need high-quality and comprehensive statistics if we are to understand the structural changes that are taking place in the economy. One obvious area where the demand for statistics is increasing is the resources sector. We need to understand where the investment is going, and how both production volumes and prices are changing. But we also need to understand how these developments are affecting other parts of the economy – what are the linkages and how are they changing.  Second, the ABS’s work is also important in helping us understand some of the risk-management issues I spoke about. We need to continue making progress on the measurement of productivity and improving our understanding of what drives increases in output per head. And on the financial side, we need to understand how the increase in Australia’s capital stock is being financed and how changes in the pattern of financing are altering the economy’s overall risk profile. I know these are the areas that the ABS is working on and I look forward to seeing the outcome of that work.  Thank you. 
 BIS Review 117/2010 1 Mervyn King: Address by Mervyn King to Trades Union Congress Address by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the 2010 Trades Union Congress, Manchester, 15 September 2010. *      *      * President and Congress  I want first to thank you for inviting me to address Congress. Members of your General Council have made a huge contribution to the Bank of England by serving on our board – the Bank’s Court. Carrying on that tradition today is Brendan Barber. By bringing a distinct and important perspective to our discussions, Brendan has helped us through some extremely turbulent times. I am grateful to him.  Recent times have indeed been turbulent. After a decade and a half of stability, with rising employment and living standards, came the crisis and recession – the biggest economic upheaval since the Great Depression. Before the crisis, steady growth with low inflation and high employment was in our grasp. We let it slip – we, that is, in the financial sector and as policy-makers – not your members nor the many businesses and organisations around the country which employ them. And although the causes of the crisis may have been rooted in the financial sector, the consequences are affecting everyone, and will continue to do so for years to come.  Thankfully, the costs of the crisis have been smaller than those of the Great Depression. But only because we learnt from that experience. An unprecedented degree of policy stimulus, here and abroad, prevented another world slump. Even so, around a million more people in Britain are out of work than before the crisis. Many, especially the young unemployed, have had their futures blighted. So we cannot just carry on as we are. Unless we reform our economy – rebalance demand, restructure banking, and restore the sustainability of our public finances – we shall not only jeopardise recovery, but also fail the next generation.  To my mind, a market economy and its disciplines offer the best way of raising living standards. But a market economy cannot survive on incentives alone. It must align those incentives to the common good. It must command support among the vast majority who do not receive the large rewards that accrue to the successful and the lucky. And it must show a sense of fairness if its efficiency is to yield fruit.  There was nothing fair about the financial crisis. It was caused not by problems in the real economy; it came out of the financial sector. But it was the real economy that suffered and the banks that were bailed out. Your members, and indeed the businesses which employ them, are entitled to be angry. But however legitimate, anger will not produce change unless its energy is harnessed to a cool analysis of what happened and why. So I want to discuss the fundamental causes of the crisis before turning to current policy.  The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 changed both politics and economics. Within a few years, the former Soviet empire, China and other Asian economies, with their combined workforce of over a billion people, entered the world trading system as market economies. Their focus on export-led growth allowed consumers in the West to enjoy rising living standards as the prices of traded goods fell. But the trade surpluses in emerging economies implied an outflow of capital. Relatively poor countries were lending money to richer western ones – the reverse of the traditional model of development. In the process, countries like China built up huge holdings of foreign assets – running into trillions of dollars – matched by equally huge debts in the deficit countries. Such massive imbalances were never likely to be sustainable, and so it proved.  If the first fundamental cause of the crisis was the scale of imbalances in the world economy, the second was the inability of our banking system to absorb such large inflows of capital 
 2 BIS Review 117/2010 without taking excessive risk. In the five years leading up to the crisis, the balance sheets of the West’s largest banks doubled – mainly because banks lent more to other firms within the financial sector than to the wider economy. And the proportion of capital held by banks shrank so that their leverage – the ratio of total liabilities to equity capital – rose to unprecedented levels. Immediately prior to the crisis, the leverage ratios of some UK banks approached 50. To say that was risky is an understatement: at such levels, a 2% fall in the value of a bank’s assets is sufficient to wipe out its capital and render it insolvent.  Remuneration, especially the structure of financial sector bonuses, encouraged excessive risk-taking, and distorted the aspirations and career choices of too many talented young people. Investors, banks and regulators had been swept up by the apparent success of modern finance. When investors realised that many of the assets that banks held on their balance sheets were opaque and hard to value, there was immediate and justifiable concern about the solvency of many of those banks.  At the end of 2008, these two fundamental factors culminated in the worst financial crisis in history. In the six months after Lehman Brothers collapsed world trade fell by nearly 20% – a faster decline than in the Great Depression. Around the world, the same telling phrase was repeated: economic activity was “falling off a cliff”. In its statement to the London G20 summit in April 2009, the international trade union movement argued that “The first priority for G20 leaders must be to restore confidence by halting the freefall in world growth”. That has been achieved. World output grew by 4% over the past year. And in the United Kingdom, growth has been somewhat faster than anticipated a year ago. Nevertheless, total UK output remains around 10% below where it would have been had the crisis not occurred.  So how do we prevent this happening again? If we are to prevent another crisis, action is required on both of the fundamental causes. First, we need to resolve the problems caused by massive capital flows from poor to rich countries. Yet the imbalances are growing again. This problem can be tackled only by international cooperation – most obviously through the G20 – and I hope that the trade union movement will continue to engage with that process.  Second, our financial system needs radical reform. Slowly but surely, we must move towards a banking system that does not put both the economy and your members’ livelihoods at risk. In the long run, banks will have to hold much more capital and be much less highly leveraged. Part of the answer is improving the way we regulate banks, and devising policy tools to control the risks taken by the financial system as a whole. The aim should not be to prevent all bank failures. Just as with every other company in the economy, banks that get it wrong must be allowed to fail, without risk to ordinary depositors or taxpayers. In 2008, banks were bailed out not to protect them but to protect the rest of the economy from the banks. That may not seem fair – and it isn’t – when other companies, such as Jaguar, had to stand on their own feet or go to the wall. So banks too must face market discipline.  But we need to do more than reform our banking system. If the world economy needs rebalancing, so does our own. The substantial trade deficit over a number of years means that national spending exceeded production. We need a higher national saving rate, a shift in spending and production away from consumption and towards exports. And a key part of that is a reduction in our budget deficit. There is a perfectly reasonable debate about the precise speed at which to reduce the deficit. Indeed, I supported the extra fiscal stimulus to the economy provided in the immediate wake of the crisis. And there is a further question about how the deficit should be reduced – the balance between raising taxes and cutting spending. That is not for me to say; that is for you and the politicians to debate. But it is indisputable that, because of the crisis, national income is 10% lower than was expected with a damaging impact on tax revenues. As a result, this country has the largest peacetime budget deficit in its history – over 11% of GDP in the fiscal year to 2010. Although a large budget deficit is inevitable for a period after a crisis, it is also clearly unsustainable – our national debt, even relative to GDP, is rising sharply and will continue to do so for several years. It is vital for any government to set out 
 BIS Review 117/2010 3 and commit to a clear and credible plan for reducing the deficit. I would be shirking my responsibilities if I did not explain to you the risks of failing to do so.  Vague promises would not have been enough. Market reaction to rising sovereign debt can turn quickly from benign to malign, as we saw in the euro area earlier this year. It is not sensible to risk a damaging rise in long-term interest rates that would make investment and the cost of mortgages more expensive. The current plan is to reduce the deficit steadily over five years – a more gradual fiscal tightening than in some other countries. As a result of a failure to put such a plan in place sooner, some euro-area countries have found – to their cost – a much more rapid adjustment being forced upon them.  Of course, no one can forecast the gusts – or indeed storms – the economy may face looking ahead. But if the recovery is slower than expected then the automatic fiscal stabilisers – the lower tax receipts and higher spending that result from weaker growth – will act to stimulate demand. And monetary policy can react too, especially when there is a credible plan to reduce the deficit.  In the wake of the worst financial crisis ever, the amount of money in our economy – broad money – is now barely growing at all. It was the failure in the 1930s to halt a marked contraction in the money supply that led to the Great Depression. So the Bank of England has taken extraordinary measures – described as “quantitative easing” – to boost the supply of money in order to support a recovery in the economy and keep inflation on track to meet our target. And because monetary policy is a flexible instrument that can be changed in either direction each month, it is the best tool for managing the economy in the short run.  Nevertheless, the road ahead is unlikely to be straight. There is considerable uncertainty about the prospects for both the United States and the euro area – our most important export markets. Business and consumer confidence at home has weakened recently, and it will be some time before our banking sector is able to finance a recovery on the usual terms. The transition to a better balanced economy will be difficult. But we are already seeing encouraging signs of expansion in manufacturing and UK exports.  This morning’s figures show a small rise in the claimant count and a small fall in the Labour Force Survey measures of unemployment. But the big picture is that unemployment is higher than before the crisis but lower than many had feared a year ago. In July, on one of my regular visits to different parts of the country, I met with the Scottish TUC in Glasgow to learn more about the labour market there. Our contacts with experienced union officials in touch with a range of companies and sectors are the best source of intelligence on labour markets. With your help, we are determined to understand what is happening in every region and country of our economy so that we can set the right monetary policy. I want to assure you that the Bank of England is there to serve the whole economy, right across the length and breadth of this country. The costs of this crisis will be with us for a generation. And we owe it to the next generation to seize this opportunity to put in place the reforms that will make another crisis much less likely and much less damaging. We at the Bank of England and you in the trade union movement should work together. That is why I am pleased to be with you today. It will require patience and determination on all our parts, including your members. But the prize of restoring and maintaining economic stability – and a return to sustained rises in employment and living standards – will be worth the effort. 
 BIS Review 117/2010 1 Axel A Weber: 7th Bundesbank Lecture 2010 – introductory remarks Introductory remarks by Professor Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank,  at the 7th Bundesbank Lecture 2010, Berlin, 14 September 2010. *      *      * 1. Introduction Ladies and gentlemen I am very pleased to welcome you to this year’s Bundesbank Lecture, which is being held at the Old Town Hall in the very heart of Berlin. The Old Town Hall was built between 1902 and 1911 as an extension of the “Red Town Hall”, which is just a stone’s throw from here. From 1949 to 1990, the Old Town Hall was the seat of the Council of Ministers of the then GDR, and, in 1990, the Unification Treaty between the two German States was negotiated in this very building. Today, it serves as the seat of the Senator for the Interior of the federal state of Berlin. The room we are in is the “Bear Hall”, named after the statue of a bronze bear in the middle of the hall. This statue – the bear is Berlin’s heraldic symbol – had been exiled to East Berlin’s zoo for four decades before it returned in 2001. It is in these historic surroundings that we have gathered for the 7th Bundesbank Lecture. I am particularly grateful that Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, will be our speaker today. Mark, my special welcome to you and thanks a lot for accepting our invitation. It is an honour to have you here. Let me say a few brief words about both this event and our speaker for today. 2. On the event When we established the Bundesbank Lecture in 2004 we had two objectives in mind: The first objective was to raise the Bundesbank’s profile further in the German capital. The second aim was to provide a high-level forum for public debate on economic and monetary policy issues. Especially this second objective seems to have gained in importance given our turbulent times and the intellectual uncertainty they have provoked. Consequently, we are happy to look back on a long line of very distinguished speakers – including, of course, Mark Carney, but also Alan Greenspan, Jean-Claude Trichet, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Ben Bernanke, Mario Draghi and Dominique Strauss-Kahn. 3. On the subject It is no surprise that the financial crisis has dominated this event during the recent past. We have just entered the fourth year of the crisis and it still seems too early to announce its end. However, we certainly are in a phase where the lessons learnt are being turned into political reality. This is especially true for the reform of financial regulation. Great effort has been put into addressing the shortcomings in the regulatory framework that were revealed by the crisis. At the global level, a comprehensive reform agenda was set in train by the G20 summits in Washington, London and Pittsburgh. The envisaged reforms aim at creating a strong regulatory framework that ensures financial stability and supports steady and sustainable economic growth. The major step towards that end will be the reform of the Basel II framework for capital regulation. Relevant proposals were put forward in December 2009 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The proposed measures have since been calibrated and have been decided as a package last weekend in Basel by the meeting of Governors and Heads of Supervision. In November, the G20 will take the final decision on the implementation of this package. 
 2 BIS Review 117/2010 The new rules will shape the financial system for years to come. There is some concern in the financial industry regarding the possible negative impacts of financial reform on the real economy. It is argued that, by placing additional burdens on banks, their capacity to hand out loans is constrained to a degree that might reduce economic performance. However, recent studies by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and others show that the impact of financial reforms on economic performance is likely to be rather small. Nevertheless, this is an important issue and I am glad that Mark will be covering it in more detail. The title of his speech is “the economic consequences of the reforms” and he is indeed the right man to provide the necessary insights. 4. On the speaker During his career, Mark Carney has been working on all sides of the financial system, so to speak. With a sound academic background from Harvard and Oxford, he joined the investment bank Goldman Sachs in 1990. For the next 13 years, he worked in the banks’ offices in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto. In 2003, he became Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada. A year later, he left the bank and assumed the post of Senior Associate Deputy Minister of Finance. In this function, he represented Canada in various international forums, including the Financial Stability Forum which is now the Financial Stability Board. In 2008, he returned as Governor to the Bank of Canada. It is this blend of different viewpoints and experiences that makes Mark Carney the perfect speaker for today’s subject. Mark, I am looking forward to hearing your insights. The floor is yours. 
Sanusi Lamido Sanusi: Evolving financial landscape – strategies for economic resilience Keynote address by Mr Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, at the 4th Annual Banking and Finance Conference of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN), Abuja, 23 September 2010. *      *      * Protocol 1.  Let me begin by appreciating the opportunity and the honour given to me to be part of this important occasion, which is meant to chart a course for sustainable economic development of our dear country, Nigeria. The theme of this conference “Evolving Financial landscape: Strategies for economic Resilience” is indeed very apt and topical, and could not have come at a more opportune time than now, considering not only the needs of country, but the rapid changes that are taking place in the financial sector and the role it is expected to play in the evolving economic landscape. It is my expectation, therefore, that the issues that will be discussed during this conference will further assist in laying a solid foundation for the much needed economic transformation of the Nigerian economy. It is usual at this conference for the Governor, if delivering the keynote address, to update the industry on his stewardship in the past year, and the expected duration of policy. 2.  As you are aware, since the commercial banking business commenced in 1892 in Nigeria, the financial system has experienced several episodes of banking crisis. The first of such crisis took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, mainly as a result of lack of appropriate regulation, leading to the collapse of about 21 of the 25 indigenous banks which had been established by 1954. While these failures were resolved mainly through self-liquidation, the outcome was a bitter experience, especially for depositors who lost their money. 3.  Systemic crises re-appeared in the Nigerian banking industry between 1989 and 1998, which many attributed to the withdrawal of public sector deposits from the banks, and as a consequence exposed the weak financial condition of most financial institutions whose financial fragility had been concealed by a combination of factors, including public subsidy and improper accounting systems. The deregulation of the banking system in the mid-1980s facilitated a dramatic increase in the number of financial institutions and also exposed the banks to intense competition for which many of them were ill-prepared for. Some of the banks attracted a significant market share through improved customer services at competitive prices. In contrast, many banks appeared to have been set up largely to take advantage of the arbitrage opportunities in the foreign exchange market, rather than undertake more conventional/traditional banking business. The consequence was a mass distress that laid the foundations for the bank consolidation exercise in 2004, which induced a breath of life to our banks, enhanced their capital position and increased their involvement in business activities. 4.  The recent global financial crisis, however, strained the gains that had been achieved post-consolidation in the sector. The immediate impact of the global financial turbulence on the Nigerian financial system, particularly the banking system, mirrored global trends but was largely contained because of the limited integration with the global financial system. While offshore funding of the domestic banking system was growing before the crisis, its scale was manageable and the Central Bank was able to accommodate commercial banks foreign exchange needs in the depth of the global crisis. Coupled with major internal management problems in some of the banks, the crises impacted the economy through various channels – significant decline in oil revenue leading to revenue attrition for all tiers of government; reduced capital inflows into the economy; significant BIS Review 124/2010 1 
drawdown of external/foreign reserves; demand pressure in the foreign exchange market; substantial decline in stock market capitalization and share prices; huge bank losses on margin loans and share-backed facilities as well as loans to the downstream oil and gas sector; low valuation with many banks trading below book value; declining asset values; and declining credit growth. 5.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, it became clear that the CBN had to act decisively when it became evident that some of the banks had more deep-rooted problems that were not discernable from the regular reports rendered to the regulatory authorities. Some of these actions included replacing the chief executives/executive directors of the banks identified as the source of instability in the industry and injection of the sum of N620.0 billion into the banks in an effort to prevent a systemic banking crisis. The injection of this fund (Tier II capital) into these banks then was considered sufficient to resolve and stabilize them to enable them to continue normal business operations, with arrangements made to recover non-performing loans from the banks’ debtors while guaranteeing all foreign credits and correspondent banking commitments. 6.  As an additional measure to strengthen the reform process, the CBN commenced the process of creating an Asset Management Company, as an important vehicle for dealing with Non Performing Loans of the banks. As you are all aware, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) has already been established by law and its Board is awaiting Senate confirmation for it to formally take-off. As a resolution vehicle, AMCON is expected to soak in the toxic assets of the CBN-intervened banks and provide liquidity to them while facilitating their eventual re-capitalization.  7.  While efforts are being made to stabilize the Banking system and, indeed, the financial system and restore public confidence, the CBN is also focusing attention on ensuring that the financial system, in general, and the banking system, in particular, begin to serve the needs of the Nigerian economy so as to make the Nigerian economy to be resilient. This, the Bank has been doing through ensuring the availability of long-term funds at an affordable interest rate to drive industrial activities and infrastructural developments in the country, having identified low industrial basis and huge infrastructural deficit as binding constraints on achieving Nigeria’s economic development objectives. In a bid to address the problem of infrastructure deficit and enhance credit to the real sector, a total of N500.0 billion Fund was set up by the CBN made up of N300.0 billion for Power/Infrastructure projects and for intervention in the Aviation sector and N200.0 billion for the Refinancing/Restructuring of banks’ existing loan portfolios to manufacturers and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A N200.0 billion Credit Guarantee Scheme for SMEs and N200.0 billion Commercial Agricultural Fund for the agricultural sector were also established. In addition, the CBN had recently released N150.0 billion credit facility to the manufacturers at a fixed rate of 7% through the Bank of Industry (BOI) and deposit money banks. Pencom to unlock pension assets for private sector – AGRA-UNIDO – Fund plan chain.  8.  In addition, the Bank has also collaborated with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), FPLS and Ministry of Finance to reduce the cost of transactions, particularly bond issues so as to diversify funding sources away from banks as well as attract more long term foreign investors into the sector. Efforts are also being intensified towards strengthening regulatory and supervisory framework and enhancing monitoring of the operations of the Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) to ensure that they remain safe, sound and healthy. These efforts are expected to ensure the sustenance of public confidence through the enforcement of appropriate disclosures and reinvigorating the policy of zero tolerance on all unprofessional and unethical banking practice, and greater emphasis on enforcement of Code of Corporate Governance. FSRCC revamped, joint CBN/SEC examinations. 9.  Standby teams of target examiners are being deployed to any bank at any time to ensure timely regulatory actions, if it is deemed necessary. In addition, to further engender 2 BIS Review 124/2010 
public confidence in the banking system and enhance customer protection, the CBN established the Consumer and Financial Protection Division to provide a platform through which consumers could seek redress, and directive has been given to banks to establish Customer Help Desks at their head offices and branches. Also, a comprehensive review of the Guide to Bank Charges has commenced with a view to making the charges realistic and consumer-friendly. Furthermore, the Consumer and Financial Protection Division is expected to commence a programme of consumer education and enlightenment and is also collaborating with the Consumer Protection Council on the review of the Consumer Protection Council Act No. 66 of 1992 to enforce discipline in the market. 10.  The CBN has taken steps to integrate the banking system into the global best practices in financial reporting and disclosure through the partial adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the Nigerian Banking Sector by end 2010. This is expected to enhance market discipline, and reduce uncertainties which limit the risk of unwarranted contagion. The CBN is also, closely collaborating with other stakeholders like the Nigerian Accounting Standard Board (NASB), Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF), NDIC, SEC, and NAICOM; PENCOM, Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), and Institute of Chartered Accountant of Nigeria (ICAN), among others, towards ensuring a seamless full adoption of IFRS in the Nigerian banking sector by 2012. These efforts are being pursued under the aegis of the Roadmap Committee of Stakeholders on the Adoption of IFRS in Nigeria inaugurated by the NASB and facilitated by the World Bank. 11.  The universal banking (UB) model adopted in 2001, allowed banks to diversify into non-bank financial businesses. Following the consolidation programme in 2004, banks became awash with capital, which was deployed into various high-risk areas. The system was abused by operators with banks engaging in non-banking practices to the detriment of core banking practices. Banks took unnecessary speculation provisions and bets on asset prices. To address the observed challenges, the CBN has reviewed the UB Model with a view to steering the banks towards core banking businesses. Under the new model, banks would not be allowed to invest in non-bank subsidiaries, while banks currently with such investments would be required to either divest or spin-off the businesses to holding companies that will be licensed by the CBN as other financial institutions. Depositors’ funds can no longer be used for insurance, stock broking and other non-banking activities. This will pave the way for the orderly development of the capital market. 12.  Other measures that have been taken to drive the evolving financial landscape include: the strengthening of the institutional coordination through the Financial Services Regulation Coordinating Committee (FSRCC), adoption of a common accounting year end for all banks, aimed at improving data integrity and comparability; conducting own-risk assessments and relying less on classifications by rating agencies; limiting the tenor of Chief Executives/Directors of Banks to 10 years and non-Executive Directors to 12 years; limiting the tenor of a bank’s auditing firm to 10 years; sound and timely regulation and supervision of the financial sector; stringent demand for transparency in the financial sector; and improved transparency in structured credit instruments for easy assessment of associated risk. 13.  Activities at the Central Bank of Nigeria are being guided by the Bank’s blue print, christened “The Alpha Project (A4) Initiatives of the CBN”, which is built on 4 pillars, of enhancing the quality of banks, establishing financial stability, enabling healthy financial sector evolution and ensuring that financial sector contributes to the real economy. 14.  Furthermore, leveraging on the CBN Governor’s role as Adviser to the President on Economic Matters to ensure that the financial sector contributes to the real economy, the CBN is taking the lead in measuring more accurately the relationship between the real economy and financial sector, as well as cooperating with state governments to run pilot programmes in directing the financial sector’s contribution to social and economic development within the states. Priority is being given to Power, Agriculture, Transportation infrastructures. The Bank has continued to fine-tune its monetary policy instruments against BIS Review 124/2010 3 
the backdrop of developments in the economy to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy. As adviser to the government, the CBN has played a critical catalytic role in kickstarting the power programme and reopening the debate on deregulating the sector, we are now engaging actively in the funding of agricultural and industrial policy to ensure that banks’ lending goes into the real economy.  15.  The Microfinance Policy, Regulatory and Supervisory framework for Nigeria was launched in December 2005 with the main objective of making financial services accessible to the active poor, promoting synergy and mainstreaming of the informal sector in the national financial system and contributing to rural transformation. Since the launch, quite a number of microfinance institutions have been licensed while the policy is being reviewed to address key challenges such as capital base, skill gaps, operational manual, geographical spread and self regulation in the sub-sector. An audit exercise of all microfinance banks has just been launched and the CBN is determined to clean up the sector and “sanitize” it as thoroughly as it is sanitizing Deposit Money Banks. 16.  Ladies and gentlemen, in order to remain relevant as financial intermediaries, financial institutions in the country would need to be sensitive to customer needs for greater efficiency and convenience. Customers’ expectations have taken a quantum leap in the new global financial landscape. Financial services no longer involve providing only standard products to customers. The need for financial products to be personalized and customized to the individual needs of corporate and retail clients is the order of the day. Financial institutions would, therefore, need to be more proactive and innovative in packaging and marketing their products. Furthermore, in the new financial environment, the need to ensure adequate and effective consumer education and protection has also become even more compelling and challenging so as to prevent any disruption in the level or reliability of services to customers and their protection from potential unfair practices. Given the criticality of … efficiency to cost of funds, the Central Bank has recently started a shared services project in collaboration with banks aimed at centralizing back offices and the industrialization of common processes. In the next three years, we will reduce overhead costs in the banking industry by 30%. We are also working towards establishing an IPP for independent power supply for all banks operating in Lagos as a pilot cluster. 17.  The intense competition among financial institutions call for the management of the country’s banks to re-examine their existing business models to see where their strengths lie and to what opportunities these strengths could be applied to enhance returns. There may be the need to move towards strategic differentiation among the financial institutions in order to better serve the relevant market segment or niches. This may involve market or functional specialization as institutions decide which functional areas or combinations of risk management, customer services, product innovations, to exploit and maximize to their advantage thereby buttressing the new blueprint of the CBN (specialized banking) for the banking sector. The different levels of authorization introduced also allow banks to be international, national or regional players. 18.  One big lesson learned from the recent crisis is the need to review the existing rules and laws relevant to the financial industry in Nigeria in line with the new financial environment and international best practice. In the wake of growth in the volume and complexity of financial transactions involving both local and foreign investors in the post-reform era, the challenge is to ensure the cooperation of both the legislature and the judiciary to work closely in the enforcement of the existing laws relating to the financial system in order to engender confidence in the system. There is a compelling need to reform the laws that pertain to the mortgage sector particularly the Land Use Act. This requires the strengthening of the primary mortgage institutions and the review of the relevant laws such as the Land Use Act. With respect to loan recovery within the framework of the financial services industry, there is need to establish special courts that will handle cases of loan defaults, credit fraud and insider abuse-related cases promptly. The CBN is scaling through 4 BIS Review 124/2010 
BIS Review 124/2010 5 on a number of legislative reforms aimed at unlocking the bottlenecks to the smooth flow of credit to the real sector and especially to Small and Medium Enterprises. 19.  A major challenge in the liquidation of the failed financial institutions in the country is the prompt disposal of their assets for the settlement of the depositors. This calls for expedited action on the operationalization of the Assets Management Corporation (AMCON) as well as the revision of the necessary laws that will make it possible for both the CBN and NDIC to liquidate failed institution(s) without prolonged litigation by the institution(s).  20.  Maintaining a safe and sound banking sector is essential, given the key role that banks play in facilitating economic growth and financing developmental projects, particularly key infrastructure, agriculture and industry. Most emerging market economies have been known to use the domestic financial institutions to execute real sector big ticket projects and financial institutions in Nigeria should not be an exception if we hope to achieve our developmental objectives. 21.  Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by noting that the evolving financial landscape, with benefit of hindsight, is capable of providing the platform for sustainable economic growth and development and economic resilience if all stakeholders in the Nigerian economic commit to all the various reforms and initiatives being implemented as well as commit to good governance and transparency in their respective areas of operation. I have no doubt in my mind that Nigeria is destined to be an economic power and a force to be reckoned with in the global economic arena if we consistently do the right things at the right time. But we have to end the past practice of seeking quick fixes and easy solution. A resilient economy requires hard work, intelligence, consistency and time. We will go through difficulties in the short term. Tough decisions have been taken and we will continue to take them. Market condition must improve. We have made the point, and will continue to make the point that there are lines in this country that cannot be crossed. And that no one can be so rich or so powerful as to get away with putting an entire system at risk to feed personal greed. 22.  As a final thought, there is no uniform effect, neither is there a single remedy to every crisis. Each brings its own surprises and risks. Clearly, we should not assume that past remedies will fully solve the current and next set of problems or address all future crises. The key is to take lessons from the past and tailor them appropriately to address future situations of potential crisis. Thank you for listening. 
Guy Quaden: Basel III and beyond Speech by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Brussels, 28 September 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the Brussels Eurofi conference and to share some thoughts with you at this opening session. It is now just about 3 years after the US subprime crisis triggered world-wide financial turbulence and 2 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers dramatically escalated the crisis.  The crisis has seriously dented belief in the ability of the markets to regulate themselves. There are currently a lot of items on the agenda of international fora waiting to be dealt with. The Financial Stability Board at the G20 level as well as Ecofin at the EU level have drawn up detailed roadmaps to pave the way for extensive reforms.  The crisis has indeed given rise to a unique momentum for profound reforms of the financial system.  We should not let this momentum slip away. Unfortunately the general public sometimes gets that impression.  Of course many complicated technical issues have had to be resolved. And I admit that it will be important to introduce the new regulations in a timely manner so as not to hamper the smooth flow of credit which will be required to support the nascent recovery. In fact, while there is much discussion as to the design of the exit strategy from the public support measures, in the monetary and financial fields, we should be equally aware of the need for an entry strategy for moving over to more comprehensive regulatory requirements.  From this point of view the recent proposal coming from Basel represents a very important contribution.  Two weeks ago, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, endorsed a broad proposal to strengthen the quality and quantity of regulatory capital held by banks and to institute a global liquidity standard. This proposal, the heart of the new Basel III framework, will be submitted to the approval of the leaders of the G20 countries at their November summit in Seoul.  The proposal represents a major reform of banking regulations, which should substantially improve the resilience of banks to stress conditions, thus reinforcing financial stability and reducing the occurrence of a new crisis with injection of public money. Key elements include not only an increase in the minimum regulatory capital requirement but also an increase in the amount of capital that must be held in the form of common equity, which offers the greatest capacity for loss absorption.  I will not discuss the various proposed ratios in detail, as by now I am sure you know them quite well. Many in the banking industry complained and argued that these reforms will make lending more expensive and imply a decline in the quantity of credit and, therefore, of GDP. We in the regulatory community believe that the length of the transition periods provided for the implementation of the new rules will significantly diminish the costs, to banks and the economy alike. Consequently, the economic cost of the transition towards the new requirements should be very small in relation to the magnitude of the long-term benefits, derived from reducing the probability of financial crises and the severe loss in GDP and growth that would ensue.  BIS Review 124/2010 1 
Moreover the banks can use different avenues to reach, if needed, higher capital ratios: raising new funds, retaining a larger part of their profit, reducing some activities that are more risky.  While the current proposal addresses a large part of the G20 global financial reform agenda, work on some crucial, additional elements will have to be completed in the coming months, in particular concerning the modalities of the introduction of a countercyclical buffer and new liquidity ratios.  But I would like to insist in this short statement on a very critical macroprudential issue not yet really addressed: the potential impact of failure of systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, and the moral hazard associated with the belief that these institutions are too big to fail, a curiosity and, if I may say so, an extravagance in a market economy.  The Basel Committee is currently working together with the Financial Stability Board to develop a comprehensive, global approach to SIFIs that could involve a potential mix of policies such as capital or liquidity surcharges, large exposure limits, contingent capital, and bail-in debt. The goal is for each jurisdiction to have in place a SIFI policy. Effective resolution regimes, will constitute the basis of the approach, upon which other policies would build. A cornerstone of this foundation should, I think, consist of recovery and resolution plans, or “living wills”, formulated by the largest financial institutions. These plans will require institutions to specify the measures they will take in the event of severe stress and will also allow authorities to assess the potential orderly resolvability of these institutions without having recourse to public funds.  The rapid spread of the financial crisis has been a lesson not only to market participants but also to supervisors. It has shown that the root of the problems was the gradual build-up of common risks within the system. It is now widely acknowledged that such crystallisation of risk, linked to major shifts in the correlation between financial products and markets, requires more systemically-focused oversight and regulation. To use the professional jargon, microprudential control, the preserve of the supervisory authorities, must be complemented by macroprudential oversight, resorting to the expertise of central banks. In order to improve the symbiosis between these two approaches, a growing number of countries are adopting the so-called “twin peaks model” where the central bank is in charge of the full range of prudential supervision, in both its micro and macro-dimension, leaving the oversight of market integrity and investor protection to a separate institution. This “twin peaks model” will also be introduced in Belgium next year.  Needless to say, I am well aware that the macro-dimension does not stop at our country’s frontiers, while the micro-supervision of cross-border groups also requires close multinational coordination. So, I strongly support the recent decision to set up, at the EU level, a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS), which are called on to cooperate closely in order to bring more comprehensiveness and consistency to national and international supervision.  Macroprudential analysis must rely on rapid, direct and comprehensive access to data on individual developments liable to affect global financial stability while, in turn, this analysis must feed into the microprudential supervision. It would be a pity if our efforts to improve this flow of information in our respective countries were to be impeded by hurdles at the international level.  In conclusion, the global nature of the crisis has highlighted the necessity of a holistic, internationally coordinated approach to achieve fundamental reforms in financial regulation. These reforms are under way. It is important that this approach result in consistent, international adherence to measures aimed to raise the capacity of individual institutions to absorb losses, reduce the impact of systemically important institutions on the financial system and the whole economy, limit the buildup of systemic risk, and foster international cooperation in macro-prudential supervision.  2 BIS Review 124/2010 
BIS Review 124/2010 3 Ladies and gentlemen, this week the Eurofi conference will provide ample opportunity to discuss and reflect on the topics and challenges the financial sector and the authorities are facing. I hope you will all have a very successful and rewarding conference and a very pleasant stay in Brussels.  Thank you for your attention.  
Ben S Bernanke: Implications of the financial crisis for economics Speech by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the conference co-sponsored by the Center for Economic Policy Studies and the Bendheim Center for Finance, Princeton, New Jersey, 24 September 2010. *      *      * Thank you for giving me this opportunity to return to Princeton. It is good to be able to catch up with old friends and colleagues and to see both the changes and the continuities on campus. I am particularly pleased to see that the Bendheim Center for Finance is thriving. When my colleagues and I founded the center a decade ago, we intended it to be a place where students would learn about not only the technicalities of modern financial theory and practice but also about the broader economic context of financial activities. Recent events have made clear that understanding the role of financial markets and institutions in the economy, and of the effects of economic developments on finance, is more important than ever.  The financial crisis that began more than three years ago has indeed proved to be among the most difficult challenges for economic policymakers since the Great Depression. The policy response to this challenge has included important successes, most notably the concerted international effort to stabilize the global financial system after the crisis reached its worst point in the fall of 2008. For its part, the Federal Reserve worked closely with other policymakers, both domestically and internationally, to help develop the collective response to the crisis, and it played a key role in that response by providing backstop liquidity to a range of financial institutions as needed to stem the panic. The Fed also developed special lending facilities that helped to restore normal functioning to critical financial markets, including the commercial paper market and the market for asset-backed securities; led the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009 that significantly improved confidence in the U.S. banking system; and, in the area of monetary policy, took aggressive and innovative actions that helped to stabilize the economy and lay the groundwork for recovery.  Despite these and other policy successes, the episode as a whole has not been kind to the reputation of economic and economists, and understandably so. Almost universally, economists failed to predict the nature, timing, or severity of the crisis; and those few who issued early warnings generally identified only isolated weaknesses in the system, not anything approaching the full set of complex linkages and mechanisms that amplified the initial shocks and ultimately resulted in a devastating global crisis and recession. Moreover, although financial markets are for the most part functioning normally now, a concerted policy effort has so far not produced an economic recovery of sufficient vigor to significantly reduce the high level of unemployment. As a result of these developments, some observers have suggested the need for an overhaul of economics as a discipline, arguing that much of the research in macroeconomics and finance in recent decades has been of little value or even counterproductive.  Although economists have much to learn from this crisis, as I will discuss, I think that calls for a radical reworking of the field go too far. In particular, it seems to me that current critiques of economics sometimes conflate three overlapping yet separate enterprises, which, for the purposes of my remarks today, I will call economic science, economic engineering, and economic management. Economic science concerns itself primarily with theoretical and empirical generalizations about the behavior of individuals, institutions, markets, and national economies. Most academic research falls in this category. Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks for achieving specific economic objectives. Examples of such frameworks are the risk-management systems of financial institutions and the financial regulatory systems of the United States and other countries. Economic management involves the operation of economic frameworks in real time – for example, in BIS Review 123/2010 1 
the private sector, the management of complex financial institutions or, in the public sector, the day-to-day supervision of those institutions.  As you may have already guessed, my terminology is intended to invoke a loose analogy with science and engineering. Underpinning any practical scientific or engineering endeavor, such as a moon shot, a heart transplant, or the construction of a skyscraper are: first, fundamental scientific knowledge; second, principles of design and engineering, derived from experience and the application of fundamental knowledge; and third, the management of the particular endeavor, often including the coordination of the efforts of many people in a complex enterprise while dealing with myriad uncertainties. Success in any practical undertaking requires all three components. For example, the fight to control AIDS requires scientific knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of the disease (the scientific component), the development of medical technologies and public health strategies (the engineering applications), and the implementation of those technologies and strategies in specific communities and for individual patients (the management aspect). Twenty years ago, AIDS mortality rates mostly reflected gaps in scientific understanding and in the design of drugs and treatment technologies; today, the problem is more likely to be a lack of funding or trained personnel to carry out programs or to apply treatments.  With that taxonomy in hand, I would argue that the recent financial crisis was more a failure of economic engineering and economic management than of what I have called economic science. The economic engineering problems were reflected in a number of structural weaknesses in our financial system. In the private sector, these weaknesses included inadequate risk-measurement and risk-management systems at many financial firms as well as shortcomings in some firms’ business models, such as overreliance on unstable short-term funding and excessive leverage. In the public sector, gaps and blind spots in the financial regulatory structures of the United States and most other countries proved particularly damaging. These regulatory structures were designed for earlier eras and did not adequately adapt to rapid change and innovation in the financial sector, such as the increasing financial intermediation taking place outside of regulated depository institutions through the so-called shadow banking system. In the realm of economic management, the leaders of financial firms, market participants, and government policymakers either did not recognize important structural problems and emerging risks or, when they identified them, did not respond sufficiently quickly or forcefully to address them. Shortcomings of what I have called economic science, in contrast, were for the most part less central to the crisis; indeed, although the great majority of economists did not foresee the near-collapse of the financial system, economic analysis has proven and will continue to prove critical in understanding the crisis, in developing policies to contain it, and in designing longer-term solutions to prevent its recurrence.  I don’t want to push this analogy too far. Economics as a discipline differs in important ways from science and engineering; the latter, dealing as they do with inanimate objects rather than willful human beings, can often be far more precise in their predictions. Also, the distinction between economic science and economic engineering can be less sharp than my analogy may suggest, as much economic research has direct policy implications. And although I don’t think the crisis by any means requires us to rethink economics and finance from the ground up, it did reveal important shortcomings in our understanding of certain aspects of the interaction of financial markets, institutions, and the economy as a whole, as I will discuss. Certainly, the crisis should lead – indeed, it is already leading – to a greater focus on research related to financial instability and its implications for the broader economy.  In the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the implications of the crisis for what I have been calling economic science, that is, basic economic research and analysis. I will first provide a few examples of how economic principles and economic research, rather than having misled us, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the crisis and are informing the regulatory response. However, the crisis did reveal some gaps in economists’ knowledge that should be remedied. I will discuss some of these gaps and suggest possible 2 BIS Review 123/2010 
directions for future research that could ultimately help us achieve greater financial and macroeconomic stability.  How economics helped us understand and respond to the crisis The financial crisis represented an enormously complex set of interactions – indeed, a discussion of the triggers that touched off the crisis and the vulnerabilities in the financial system and in financial regulation that allowed the crisis to have such devastating effects could more than fill my time this afternoon.1 The complexity of our financial system, and the resulting difficulty of predicting how developments in one financial market or institution may affect the system as a whole, presented formidable challenges. But, at least in retrospect, economic principles and research were quite useful for understanding key aspects of the crisis and for designing appropriate policy responses.  For example, the excessive dependence of some financial firms on unstable short-term funding led to runs on key institutions, with highly adverse implications for the functioning of the system as a whole. The fact that dependence on unstable short-term funding could lead to runs is hardly news to economists; it has been a central issue in monetary economics since Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot wrote about the question in the 19th century.2 Indeed, the recent crisis bore a striking resemblance to the bank runs that figured so prominently in Thornton’s and Bagehot’s eras; but in this case, the run occurred outside the traditional banking system, in the shadow banking system – consisting of financial institutions other than regulated depository institutions, such as securitization vehicles, money market funds, and investment banks. Prior to the crisis, these institutions had become increasingly dependent on various forms of short-term wholesale funding, as had some globally active commercial banks. Examples of such funding include commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos), and securities lending. In the years immediately before the crisis, some of these forms of funding grew especially rapidly; for example, repo liabilities of U.S. broker-dealers increased by a factor of 2–1/2 in the four years before the crisis, and a good deal of this expansion reportedly funded holdings of relatively less liquid securities.  In the historically familiar bank run during the era before deposit insurance, retail depositors who heard rumors about the health of their bank – whether true or untrue – would line up to withdraw their funds. If the run continued, then, absent intervention by the central bank or some other provider of liquidity, the bank would run out of the cash necessary to pay off depositors and then fail as a result. Often, the panic would spread as other banks with similar characteristics to, or having a financial relationship with, the one that had failed came under suspicion. In the recent crisis, money market mutual funds and their investors, as well as other providers of short-term funding, were the economic equivalent of early-1930s retail depositors. Shadow banks relied on these providers to fund longer-term credit instruments, including securities backed by subprime mortgages. After house prices began to decline, concerns began to build about the quality of subprime mortgage loans and, consequently,                                                  1  For a more comprehensive discussion of vulnerabilities and triggers during the financial crisis, see Ben S. Bernanke (2010), “Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis,” testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, September 2. 2  See Henry Thornton ([1802] 1962), An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain (New York: A. M. Kelley); and Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons). A discussion relating the Federal Reserve’s policy actions during the financial crisis to the ideas of Bagehot is contained in Brian F. Madigan (2009), “Bagehot’s Dictum in Practice: Formulating and Implementing Policies to Combat the Financial Crisis,” speech delivered at “Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 20–22.

about the quality of the securities into which these and other forms of credit had been packaged. Although many shadow banks had limited exposure to subprime loans and other questionable credits, the complexity of the securities involved and the opaqueness of many of the financial arrangements made it difficult for investors to distinguish relative risks. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, many investors concluded that simply withdrawing funds was the easier and more prudent alternative. In turn, financial institutions, knowing the risks posed by a run, began to hoard cash, which dried up liquidity and significantly limited their willingness to extend new credit.3  Because the runs on the shadow banking system occurred in a historically unfamiliar context, outside the commercial banking system, both the private sector and the regulators insufficiently anticipated the risk that such runs might occur. However, once the threat became apparent, two centuries of economic thinking on runs and panics were available to inform the diagnosis and the policy response. In particular, in the recent episode, central banks around the world followed the dictum set forth by Bagehot in 1873: To avert or contain panics, central banks should lend freely to solvent institutions, against good collateral.4 The Federal Reserve indeed acted quickly to provide liquidity to the banking system, for example, by easing lending terms at the discount window and establishing regular auctions in which banks could bid for term central bank credit. Invoking emergency powers not used since the 1930s, the Federal Reserve also found ways to provide liquidity to critical parts of the shadow banking system, including securities dealers, the commercial paper market, money market mutual funds, and the asset-backed securities market. For today’s purposes, my point is not to review this history but instead to point out that, in its policy response, the Fed was relying on well-developed economic ideas that have deep historical roots.5 The problem in this case was not a lack of professional understanding of how runs come about or how central banks and other authorities should respond to them. Rather, the problem was the failure of both private- and public-sector actors to recognize the potential for runs in an institutional context quite different than the circumstances that had given rise to such events in the past. These failures in turn were partly the result of a regulatory structure that had not adapted adequately to the rise of shadow banking and that placed insufficient emphasis on the detection of systemic risks, as opposed to risks to individual institutions and markets.  Economic research and analysis have proved useful in understanding many other aspects of the crisis as well. For example, one of the most important developments in economics over recent decades has been the flowering of information economics, which studies how incomplete information or differences in information among economic agents affect market                                                  3  See Gary B. Gorton (2008), “The Panic of 2007,”  paper presented at “Maintaining Stability in a Changing Financial System,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 21–23. Also see Markus K. Brunnermeier (2009), “Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007–2008,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 23 (Winter), pp. 77–100. 4  Bagehot also suggested that “these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest” (Lombard Street, p. 99; see note 2). Some modern commentators have rationalized Bagehot’s dictum to lend at a high or “penalty” rate as a way to mitigate moral hazard – that is, to help maintain incentives for private-sector banks to provide for adequate liquidity in advance of any crisis. However, the risk of moral hazard did not appear to be Bagehot’s principal motivation for recommending a high rate; rather, he saw it as a tool to dissuade unnecessary borrowing and thus help protect the Bank of England’s own finite store of liquid assets. See Bernanke, “Liquidity Provision,” in note 2 for further documentation. Today, potential limitations on the central bank’s lending capacity are not nearly so pressing an issue as in Bagehot’s time, when the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity was far more tenuous. Generally, the Federal Reserve lent at rates above the “normal” rate for the market but lower than the rate prevailing in distressed and illiquid markets. This strategy provided needed liquidity while encouraging borrowers to return to private markets when conditions normalized. 5  A substantial modern literature has updated and formalized many of the insights of Bagehot and Thornton. A classic example is Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401–19. 4 BIS Review 123/2010 
outcomes.6 An important branch of information economics, principal-agent theory, considers the implications of differences in information between the principals in a relationship (say, the shareholders of a firm) and the agents who work for the principals (say, the firm’s managers). Because the agent typically has more information than the principal – managers tend to know more about the firm’s opportunities and problems than do the shareholders, for example – and because the financial interests of the principal and the agent are not perfectly aligned, much depends on the contract (whether explicit or implicit) between the principal and the agent, and, in particular, on the incentives that the contract provides the agent.  Poorly structured incentives were pervasive in the crisis. For example, compensation practices at financial institutions, which often tied bonuses to short-term results and made insufficient adjustments for risk, contributed to an environment in which both top managers and lower-level employees, such as traders and loan officers, took excessive risks. Serious problems with the structure of incentives also emerged in the application of the so-called originate-to-distribute model to subprime mortgages. To satisfy the strong demand for securitized products, both mortgage lenders and those who packaged the loans for sale to investors were compensated primarily on the quantity of “product” they moved through the system. As a result, they paid less attention to credit quality and many loans were made without sufficient documentation or care in underwriting. Conflicts of interest at credit agencies, which were supposed to serve investors but had incentives to help issuers of securities obtain high credit ratings, are another example.  Consistent with key aspects of research in information economics, the public policy responses to these problems have focused on improving market participants’ incentives. For example, to address problems with compensation practices, the Federal Reserve, in conjunction with other supervisory agencies, has subjected compensation practices of banking institutions to supervisory review. The interagency supervisory guidance supports compensation practices that induce employees to take a longer-term perspective, such as paying part of employees’ compensation in stock that vests based on sustained strong performance. To ameliorate the problems with the originate-to-distribute model, recent legislation requires regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve, to develop new standards applicable to securitization activities that would better align the incentives faced by market participants involved in the various stages of the securitization process.7 And the Securities and Exchange Commission has been charged with developing new rules to reduce conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies.                                                   6  George Akerlof, A. Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics for their leadership in the development of information economics. 7  The requirements related to credit risk were contained in section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111–203 (July 2010); with regard to compensation practices, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Issues Proposed Guidance on Incentive Compensation,” press release, October 22; also see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC Issue Final Guidance on Incentive Compensation,” joint press release, June 21.  Why might government intervention be needed to improve private-sector incentives, when incentives presumably exist for the private-sector principals and agents to work out the best incentive structure for themselves? The possibility of problems arising regarding collective action when a firm has many shareholders is one rationale. The standard reason for intervening in banks’ risk-taking practices is the existence of deposit insurance, which itself distorts private risk-taking incentives by eliminating any incentive of depositors to monitor the activities of their bank; for an early discussion, see John Kareken and Neil Wallace (1978), “Deposit Insurance and Bank Regulation: A Partial-Equilibrium Exposition,” Journal of Business, vol. 51 (July), pp. 413–38. Indeed, the Federal Reserve invoked a “safety and soundness” rationale for its guidance on incentive compensation practices. More generally, as the crisis revealed, bad incentives can lead to problems that affect not just the individuals involved but the broader financial system as well; such spillovers suggest that regulation can help improve outcomes. BIS Review 123/2010 5 
Information economics and principal-agent theory are also essential to understanding the problems created by so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Prior to the crisis, market participants believed that large, complex, and interconnected financial firms would not be allowed to fail during a financial crisis. And, as you know, authorities both in the United States and abroad did in fact intervene on a number of occasions to prevent the failure of such firms – not out of any special consideration for the owners, managers, or creditors of these firms, but because of legitimate concerns about potential damage to the financial system and the broader economy. However, although the instability caused by the failure or near-failure of some large firms did indeed prove very costly, in some sense the real damage was done before the crisis. If creditors in good times believe that certain firms will not be allowed to fail, they will demand relatively little compensation for risk, thus weakening market discipline; in addition, creditors will not have much incentive to monitor the firms’ risk-taking. As a result, as predicted by principal-agent theory, firms thought to be too big to fail tended to take on more risk, as they faced little pressure from investors and expected to receive assistance if their bets went bad. This problem is an example of what economists refer to as moral hazard. The resulting buildup of risk in too-big-to-fail firms increased the likelihood that a financial crisis would occur and worsened the crisis when it did occur.  One response to excessive risk-taking is stronger oversight by regulators, and the recent legislation and the rules and procedures being developed by the Federal Reserve and other agencies will subject systemically critical firms to tougher regulatory requirements and stricter supervision. The Federal Reserve has also been involved in international negotiations to raise the capital and liquidity that banks are required to hold. However, the problem of too-big-to-fail can only be eliminated when market participants believe authorities’ statements that they will not intervene to prevent failures. If creditors believe that the government will not rescue firms when their bets go bad, then creditors will have more-appropriate incentives to price, monitor, and limit the risk-taking of the firms to which they lend. The best way to achieve such credibility is to create institutional arrangements under which a failure can be allowed to occur without widespread collateral damage; if failures can take place more safely, the authorities will no longer have an incentive to try to avoid them. The financial reform legislation took an important step in this direction by creating a resolution regime under which large, complex financial firms can be placed in receivership, but which also gives the government the flexibility to take the actions needed to safeguard systemic stability. This new regime should help restore market discipline by putting a greater burden on creditors and counterparties to monitor the risk-taking of large financial firms.  The insights of economists proved valuable to policymakers in many other contexts as well: in the setting and oversight of bank capital standards, in the decision to provide the market with extensive information gleaned during the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009, in the design of the Fed’s liquidity facilities for nondepository institutions, in the analysis of the collapse of the securitization market, and in the measures taken to protect consumers from deceptive or inappropriate lending, to name a few. Many of the key ideas, like those of Thornton and Bagehot, were quite old, but some reflected relatively recent research. For example, recent work on monetary policy helped the Federal Reserve provide further policy accommodation despite the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound on interest rates.8                                                   8  The Federal Reserve did so by, for example, (1) acting rapidly when confronted with the zero lower bound, as discussed in David Reifschneider and John C. Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936–66; (2) providing forward guidance regarding short-term interest rates, as discussed in Gauti Eggertsson and Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest-Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2003 (1), pp. 139–211; and (3) expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet through purchases of longer-term securities, as discussed in Ben S. Bernanke, Vincent R. Reinhart, and Brian P. Sack (2004), “Monetary Policy Alternatives at the Zero Bound: An Empirical Assessment,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2004 (2), pp. 1–78. 6 BIS Review 123/2010 
Economics and economic research in the wake of the crisis Economic principles and research have been central to understanding and reacting to the crisis. That said, the crisis and its lead up also challenged some important economic principles and research agendas. I will briefly indicate some areas that, I believe, would benefit from more attention from the economics profession.  Most fundamentally, and perhaps most challenging for researchers, the crisis should motivate economists to think further about their modeling of human behavior. Most economic researchers continue to work within the classical paradigm that assumes rational, self-interested behavior and the maximization of “expected utility” – a framework based on a formal description of risky situations and a theory of individual choice that has been very useful through its integration of economics, statistics, and decision theory.9 An important assumption of that framework is that, in making decisions under uncertainty, economic agents can assign meaningful probabilities to alternative outcomes. However, during the worst phase of the financial crisis, many economic actors – including investors, employers, and consumers – metaphorically threw up their hands and admitted that, given the extreme and, in some ways, unprecedented nature of the crisis, they did not know what they did not know. Or, as Donald Rumsfeld might have put it, there were too many “unknown unknowns.” The profound uncertainty associated with the “unknown unknowns” during the crisis resulted in panicky selling by investors, sharp cuts in payrolls by employers, and significant increases in households’ precautionary saving.  The idea that, at certain times, decisionmakers simply cannot assign meaningful probabilities to alternative outcomes – indeed, cannot even think of all the possible outcomes – is known as Knightian uncertainty, after the economist Frank Knight who discussed the idea in the 1920s. Although economists and psychologists have long recognized the challenges such ambiguity presents and have analyzed the distinction between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion, much of this work has been abstract and relatively little progress has been made in describing and predicting the behavior of human beings under circumstances in which their knowledge and experience provide little useful information.10 Research in this area could aid our understanding of crises and other extreme situations. I suspect that progress will require careful empirical research with attention to psychological as well as economic factors.  Another issue that clearly needs more attention is the formation and propagation of asset price bubbles. Scholars did a great deal of work on bubbles after the collapse of the dot-com bubble a decade ago, much of it quite interesting, but the profession seems still quite far from consensus and from being able to provide useful advice to policymakers. Much of the literature at this point addresses how bubbles persist and expand in circumstances where we would generally think they should not, such as when all agents know of the existence of a bubble or when sophisticated arbitrageurs operate in a market. As it was put by my former colleague, Markus Brunnermeier, a scholar affiliated with the Bendheim center who has done                                                  9  Herein I use the extension of Von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility, which focused on objective probabilities over risks, to situations in which individuals assign subjective probabilities over risks. For a review of some classic contributions in this area, see Jacques H. Drèze (1974), “Axiomatic Theories of Choice, Cardinal Utility and Subjective Probability: A Review,” in Jacques H. Drèze, ed., Allocation under Uncertainty: Equilibrium and Optimality (London: Macmillan), pp. 3–23. Some authors have used risk to refer to a situation of objective probabilities and uncertainty to refer to a situation of subjective probabilities (see, for example, David M. Kreps (1990), A Course in Microeconomic Theory (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press)). As highlighted below, others refer to uncertainty as a situation in which subjective probabilities cannot be assessed. As this discussion makes clear, it is probably best to focus on the context in which the terms risk and uncertainty are used. 10  The classic reference on ambiguity aversion is due to Daniel Ellsberg (1961), “Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 75 (4), pp. 643–69; for a more recent, and abstract, theoretical treatment, see Larry G. Epstein (1999), “A Definition of Uncertainty Aversion,” Review of Economic Studies, vol. 66 (July), pp. 579–608. BIS Review 123/2010 7 
important research on bubbles, “We do not have many convincing models that explain when and why bubbles start.”11 I would add that we also don’t know very much about how bubbles stop either, and better understanding this process – and its implications for the household, business, and financial sectors – would be very helpful in the design of monetary and regulatory policies.  Another issue brought to the fore by the crisis is the need to better understand the determinants of liquidity in financial markets. The notion that financial assets can always be sold at prices close to their fundamental values is built into most economic analysis, and before the crisis, the liquidity of major markets was often taken for granted by financial market participants and regulators alike. The crisis showed, however, that risk aversion, imperfect information, and market dynamics can scare away buyers and badly impair price discovery. Market illiquidity also interacted with financial panic in dangerous ways. Notably, a vicious circle sometimes developed in which investor concerns about the solvency of financial firms led to runs: To obtain critically needed liquidity, firms were forced to sell assets quickly, but these “fire sales” drove down asset prices and reinforced investor concerns about the solvency of the firms. Importantly, this dynamic contributed to the profound blurring of the distinction between illiquidity and insolvency during the crisis. Studying liquidity and illiquidity is difficult because it requires going beyond standard models of market clearing to examine the motivations and interactions of buyers and sellers over time.12 However, with regulators prepared to impose new liquidity requirements on financial institutions and to require changes in the operations of key markets to ensure normal functioning in times of stress, new policy-relevant research in this area would be most welcome.  I have been discussing needed research in microeconomics and financial economics but have not yet touched on macroeconomics. Standard macroeconomic models, such as the workhorse new-Keynesian model, did not predict the crisis, nor did they incorporate very easily the effects of financial instability. Do these failures of standard macroeconomic models mean that they are irrelevant or at least significantly flawed? I think the answer is a qualified no. Economic models are useful only in the context for which they are designed. Most of the time, including during recessions, serious financial instability is not an issue. The standard models were designed for these non-crisis periods, and they have proven quite useful in that context. Notably, they were part of the intellectual framework that helped deliver low inflation and macroeconomic stability in most industrial countries during the two decades that began in the mid-1980s.  That said, understanding the relationship between financial and economic stability in a macroeconomic context is a critical unfinished task for researchers. Earlier work that attempted to incorporate credit and financial intermediation into the study of economic fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy represents one possible starting point. To give an example that I know particularly well, much of my own research as an academic (with coauthors such as Mark Gertler and Simon Gilchrist) focused on the role of financial factors in propagating and amplifying business cycles. Gertler and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki have further developed that basic framework to look at the macroeconomic effects of financial crises.13 More generally, I am encouraged to see the large number of recent studies that have incorporated banking and credit creation in standard macroeconomic models, though most of this work is still some distance from capturing the complex interactions of risk-taking,                                                  11  See Markus K. Brunnermeier (2008), “Bubbles,” in Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume, eds., The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd ed. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan). 12  Good work has been done in this area; see, for example, Franklin Allen, Elena Carletti, Jan P. Krahnen, and Marcel Tyrell, eds.

liquidity, and capital in our financial system and the implications of these factors for economic growth and stability.14  It would also be fruitful, I think, if “closed-economy” macroeconomists would look more carefully at the work of international economists on financial crises. Drawing on the substantial experience in emerging market economies, international economists have examined the origins and economic effects of banking and currency crises in some detail. They have also devoted considerable research to the international contagion of financial crises, a related topic that is of obvious relevance to our recent experience.  Finally, macroeconomic modeling must accommodate the possibility of unconventional monetary policies, a number of which have been used during the crisis. Earlier work on this topic relied primarily on the example of Japan; now, a number of data points can be used. For example, the experience of the United States and the United Kingdom with large-scale asset purchases could be explored to improve our understanding of the effects of such transactions on longer-term yields and how such effects can be incorporated into modern models of the term structure of interest rates.15  Conclusion I began my remarks by drawing the distinction between the scientific, engineering, and management aspects of economics. For the most part, in my view, the financial crisis reflected problems in what I referred to as economic engineering and economic management. Both private-sector arrangements (for example, for risk management and funding) and the financial regulatory framework were flawed in design and execution, and these weaknesses were the primary reasons that the financial crisis and its economic effects were so severe.  Disasters require urgent action to prevent repetition. Engineers seek to enhance the reliability of a complex machine through improvements in basic design; more-rigorous testing and quality assurance; and increases in the resilience of the machine through means such as stronger materials, greater redundancy, and better backup systems. Economic policymakers’ efforts to avoid, or at least mitigate, future financial crises are proceeding along analogous lines. First, the recent reform legislation has improved the design of the regulatory framework, closing important gaps such as the lack of oversight of the shadow banking system. Likewise, in the private sector, firms have taken significant steps to improve their systems for managing risk and liquidity. Second, to reduce the probability and severity of future crises, policymakers will monitor the system more intensively. For example, the recent legislation creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of the financial regulatory agencies, which will assess potential risks to the financial system, identify regulatory gaps, and coordinate the efforts of the various agencies. Enhanced market                                                  14  See, for example, Marvin Goodfriend and Bennett T. McCallum (2007), “Banking and Interest Rates in Monetary Policy Analysis: A Quantitative Exploration,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (5),  pp.1480–1507; and Lawrence J.

10 BIS Review 123/2010 discipline, the result of a new resolution regime for systemically critical firms and a number of measures to increase transparency, will complement regulatory oversight. Finally, numerous steps, both prescribed in the legislation and taken independently by regulators, will work to make our financial system more resilient to shocks. Examples include rules that will strengthen key financial utilities, toughen bank capital and liquidity standards, and require that more derivatives instruments be standardized and traded on exchanges rather than over the counter.  Economic engineering is effective only in combination with good economic management. For its part, the Federal Reserve has revamped its supervisory operations to provide more effective and comprehensive oversight. In particular, we are taking an approach that is both more multi-disciplinary – making greater use of the Federal Reserve’s wide expertise in macroeconomics, finance, and other fields to complement the work of bank supervisors; and more macroprudential – that is, focused on risks to the system as a whole as well as those to individual institutions. Together, better design of private- and public-sector frameworks for managing risk, better monitoring and supervision, and a more resilient financial system do not by any means guarantee that financial crises will not recur, but they should both reduce the risk of crises and mitigate the effects of any that do happen.  In short, the financial crisis did not discredit the usefulness of economic research and analysis by any means; indeed, both older and more recent ideas drawn from economic research have proved invaluable to policymakers attempting to diagnose and respond to the financial crisis. However, the crisis has raised some important questions that are already occupying researchers and should continue to do so. As I have discussed today, more work is needed on the behavior of economic agents in times of profound uncertainty; on asset price bubbles and the determinants of market liquidity; and on the implications of financial factors, including financial instability, for macroeconomics and monetary policy. Much of that work is already under way at the Bendheim center and in the Department of Economics here at Princeton. 
Svein Gjedrem: Business cycles, crises and public finances –  will governments be able to honour their debts? Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration, Bergen, 24 September 2010. The text below may differ from the actual presentation. This speech does not contain assessments of the economic situation or current interest rate setting. *      *      * 1. Imbalances and financial crisis The financial crisis had its origins in an abundant supply of credit, market participants who took steadily higher risk and a lack of oversight on the part of banks, companies and authorities.  The global economy entered a severe downturn. The acute crisis in financial markets has been succeeded by substantial labour market and fiscal imbalances in countries around us. Severe shortcomings in the management of public finances in several advanced economies have also been revealed. How public finances are managed in these countries will also be important to Norway.  In the period from 1993 to 2008, global output expanded by more than 60 per cent, or an annual rate of just under 4 per cent. At the same time, inflation remained low.  This period in the Norwegian economy could be described as two golden decades. But imbalances were building up in Europe and North America. With strong income growth and easy access to loans, the number and size of homes purchased by households grew. House prices surged in many countries. The building industry and the financial sector expanded more than other segments of the economy.  Many governments allowed their expenditure to rise in pace with higher tax revenues. Like the banks, many governments also moved some expenditure off the balance sheet, through public private partnership (PPP) agreements, for example.  The bubble was allowed to expand. Households borrowed too much, house prices were too high, banks and the building industry were too big and government expenditure and debt grew too rapidly. The imbalances gradually surfaced. The problems arose initially in the US housing market and spread in earnest when money and capital markets abruptly dried up in September 2008.  Once the crisis had become a reality, the authorities responded rapidly. To begin with, they provided support where the financial markets had failed, by providing guarantees, offering liquidity and funding and purchasing securities. Central bank key rates were aggressively cut. The crisis in the 1930s had shown that the cost of failing to implement such measures was very high. (See Chart: Sovereign debt to GDP in the G7.) The rescue packages moved private debt onto government and central bank balance sheets. In addition, tax revenues declined and social security expenditure increased. In the next phase, governments had to counteract falling corporate and household demand for goods and services by increasing public consumption and investment. Many countries entered the crisis with deficits and a relatively high level of debt. Public debt in the major advanced economies is now as high, as a share of GDP, as it was after the Second World War, when high military spending had been financed by borrowing. (See Chart: Government bond yields.) In late autumn 2009, fears arose in financial markets that some countries would be unable to pay their debts. The unrest was triggered when Greece announced that its public finances BIS Review 123/2010 1 
were in poor shape. Government bond yields rose markedly in Greece, Spain, Portugal and subsequently Ireland compared with German bond yields. Sovereign credit ratings were downgraded and the price of insurance against sovereign debt default soared. (See Chart: Credit risk on sovereign debt.) Sovereign debt has been regarded as the safest form of investment in advanced economies since the Second World War. Until recently, sovereign risk premium differentials in Europe have been small. This has changed. It now costs more to insure against a sovereign debt default by Spain and Italy than to insure against default by Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico. (See Chart: Bond yields.) States in southern Europe also have to pay higher interest rates than sound private borrowers in the euro area. There are also examples of states paying higher interest rates than the soundest of private borrowers in the same country. In spring 2010, Greece encountered acute payment problems. On 2 May, agreement was reached between Greece, the IMF and the other euro area countries on a three-year loan package with a maximum limit of EUR 110 billion. The agreement included a comprehensive IMF adjustment program. Greece has borrowed approximately EUR 30 billion from the IMF and the euro area countries since May. Other European countries with weak public finances were also being scrutinised and there was a risk of contagion to the banking system in Europe, which was behind many of the loans. On 10 May the EU and the European Central Bank announced extensive support measures for EU countries, including the European Financial Stability Facility, which can provide loans to countries in difficulty up to a total limit of EUR 500 billion, with additional loans of up to EUR 250 billion made available by the IMF through its program facilities. Countries may draw on these loan facilities provided that taxes are increased and expenditure cut so as to enable the country to gradually become self-supporting. At the same time, the European Central Bank began to buy government bonds, which had become difficult to trade on the market, enabling markets and monetary policy to function more effectively.  Economic history shows that periods of surging corporate and household debt and sharply rising property prices often precede banking crises. The fates of banks and states are inextricably linked. Banking crises usually lead to fiscal crises. Similarly, weak government finances will undermine banks’ financial position.1  Crises are costly. A historical study of financial crises shows that annual economic growth has been about 1 per cent lower in the decade following a crisis than in the decade preceding it.2 Unemployment also typically remains higher throughout the decade following the crisis.  We should perhaps not be surprised by these results. Since the activity level is usually high and unemployment low just before a crisis, we cannot expect economic growth to be as strong after the crisis as it was in the preceding period. Crises can have their advantages. In Norway, and in the other Nordic countries, the crisis years around 1990 brought changes in regulation, more open markets and the restructuring of public and private enterprises. In the crisis, the foundations were laid for the two golden decades that followed for the Norwegian economy.                                                   1  Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S.

2. Why should governments repay debt? Governments borrow and save in order to smooth income and expenditure over time. Sovereign debt can be denominated in domestic or foreign currency, and can be issued domestically or abroad. The Norwegian government relied on foreign funding in the 1970s to develop Norway’s oil industry and welfare state. Since that time, North Sea oil revenues have been substantial, and today the Norwegian government invests its large surpluses in equities and bonds in other countries.  Sovereign debt differs from private debt. Private debt is protected by the law in the country where the loan is contracted. The creditor can recover debt by legal means in the event of default.  Similar mechanisms do not in principle exist for sovereign debt. There is no supranational body that can recover government debt when a government defaults.3 If a government does not consider itself to be legally obliged to repay its creditor, it might be tempting to default. In the economic literature the question has therefore been raised: Why should a government repay debt? This question begs another: If governments can turn their backs on commitments, why do investors lend them money? We observe that most countries choose to repay debt. This must mean that there are costs associated with default.  Even if the creditor has no legal recourse for collecting debt, there are forms of costs that can be imposed on the debtor.  First, creditors can refrain from providing new loans to a government in default. When a government is in debt negotiations, it is naturally difficult to raise new capital. But recent history shows that it does not take long before creditors are again willing to provide loans.  Second, borrowing costs may increase. Funding rates rise when fears of sovereign default spread through the markets. For 30 countries that have defaulted on sovereign debt in recent decades, the interest rate on government bonds was 4 percentage points higher than normal one year after default and 2.5 percentage points higher the second year.4 Thereafter, interest rates fell rapidly to more normal levels.  Third, a creditor can impose sanctions, such as trade blockades, seizure of foreign assets or choose even more severe measures.  At the end of the 19th century, England took control of Egypt’s government finances because of the country’s payment problems. Egypt had raised a number of loans to finance the construction of the Suez Canal. The administration established by the British government restored order to Egypt’s government finances and remained in the country for 40 years.  It is likely that economic incentives also play a part in today’s armed conflicts, but such instruments are not used to recover sovereign debt. The most effective weapon available to a creditor today is probably to take legal action to seize the debtor’s foreign assets. In the past 30 years, creditors have won several such cases.  Several studies of sovereign debt crises over the past century have shown that creditors’ actions have not resulted in particularly high costs for the debtor state. A state soon regains access to capital markets after default and borrowing costs fall back fairly rapidly.  If the costs of default are transient, defaulting could be a profitable proposition. When a loan matures, it may therefore be tempting for a government to renege on its promise to repay the                                                  3  See Carl August Fleischer (2005): Folkerett (International law). 4  Eduardo Borensztein and Ugo Panizza (2009): “The Costs of Sovereign Default”, IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 56, No. 4.

debt. In economic policy this is known as a time-inconsistency problem. It can be profitable to make lofty promises, but turn your back on them once you have cashed in the benefits. Why do countries not renege on commitments in stable times? We observe that they do honour their commitments, but the economic literature does not provide us with a good explanation for why this is the case. Countries want to preserve a good reputation. Governments that default do so in adverse times, but only after sharp fiscal retrenchment to avoid that fate. 3. Countries default more frequently than we believe It is no new phenomenon that some countries live beyond their means and fail to settle the bill. History shows that many countries have defaulted on sovereign debts. This has occurred during emerging phases. From 1500 to 1900, Spain defaulted on its sovereign debt 14 times.5 France defaulted nine times in the same period, while the states that later became Germany defaulted six times. England also defaulted once, but as far back as in 1594. (See Chart: Sovereign debt default.) The Norwegian government has not always managed to settle its debts, but by little fault of its own as Norway was left with considerable government debt after the secession from Denmark in 1814. The government had no Treasury or liquid assets. Attempts to increase tax revenues failed. Moreover, Norway had little creditworthiness. At the beginning of 1816 the government was not in a position to service its debt. After more than four years, the debt was negotiated down from 6 to 3 million speciedaler. The entire principal was to be repaid over a ten-year period. In January 1820, Norway concluded a loan contract with the finance company Benecke Brothers in Berlin.6 It was positive for a young nation to be able to borrow, but the terms of the loan were generally perceived as being poor, and the loan was popularly referred to as “tyvelånet” (highway robbery). All government property and current customs revenues were required as collateral. After a period, the “tyvelån” was replaced by a loan on more favourable terms.  After the Great Depression in the 1930s, many European states struggled with debt problems. Government debt was written down in Austria, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Turkey in the 1930s and 1940s. Germany was not able to pay war reparations after World War I.  Since World War II sovereign defaults have only occurred in developing countries and emerging economies, particularly in the period between 1980 and 2000. Many of the countries pursued a policy that resulted in high inflation. It became increasingly difficult for these countries to raise loans in domestic currency, particularly loans with long maturities. Attempts were made to keep inflation and the magnitude of foreign debt in check by pegging the domestic currency to the US dollar. But fiscal mismanagement often triggered currency crises, a fall in the value of domestic currency and a surge in foreign debt. This is when the government gave up and stopped servicing debt.  The degree of losses incurred by creditors in connection with sovereign default has varied. The most recent default episodes have left creditors with losses ranging between an estimated 30 and 75 per cent.7 These experiences will probably influence interest rates on sovereign loans when a country’s debt-servicing capacity is in question.                                                   5  Carmen M.

A forum was established, the Paris Club, which meets regularly to find solutions to bilateral debt problems. The Paris Club consists of 19 creditor governments, including Norway. A solution is contingent on the implementation of reforms in the debtor country as part of an adjustment program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1956, the Paris Club has negotiated 417 debt reduction agreements with 87 countries. The Paris Club primarily negotiates debt relief with countries – often poor countries – that do not have access to traditional international funding markets.  There is no supranational body for debt negotiations for countries that have borrowed in international capital markets. Some years ago, the IMF attempted to draw up a regulatory framework for governments and creditors, but did not receive the necessary support from member countries. The IMF’s work has, however, led to more frequent inclusion of clauses in international loan agreements that facilitate constructive debt negotiations.8  In our economic system, the bankruptcy system is a useful instrument. It enables businesses to put earlier mistakes behind them and reemploy real capital and labour. Debt arrangements for governments can play a similar role and counteract downward spirals. (See Chart: Inflation.) There are two forms of debt default. Breach of contract is one form where the borrower fails to honour the contractual obligations, as illustrated in the example here. For debt denominated in domestic currency, the state can also default by pursuing an inflationary economic policy, reducing the real value of the loan. Over the past 100 years inflation in Norway surged during the two world wars and during the Korean War. The last period of soaring inflation was in the 1970s and 1980s, which resulted in a sharp fall in the real value of the bonds issued in the 1950s and 1960s.  I would also like to cite a curious example from our own monetary history9: The Norwegian state took advantage of a fall in the value of money when it was to redeem government bonds issued between 1896 and 1909. France was one of the primary bondholders. The bonds were issued during the gold standard period when the value of the krone was directly linked to the value of gold. The lenders were promised repayment in “monnaie d’or” (gold coins). When the bonds fell due, the Norwegian government insisted on repaying the debt using banknotes that had lost a substantial share of their value. France took legal action. The case was brought before the Norwegian Supreme Court in 1962, and the Court invoked a law from 1923 stipulating that the gold clause, i.e. repayment in gold coins, did not apply when the redemption obligation was suspended, which it was definitively in 1931. The Supreme Court also invoked “society’s vital interests” in its argumentation behind the decision. The cost of repaying the gold coins that were borrowed 60 years earlier would have been excessively high for Norwegian state.  The ruling is probably an example of the limited benefit to be gained by a creditor when such a case is tried by the debtor country’s legal apparatus.  For Nicolai Rygg, governor of Norges Bank from 1920 to 1946, the value of money was a moral issue. The aim of the policy of gold parity in the 1920s was to bring the krone back to the value prevailing before World War I: “Our monetary regime is enshrined in law. (…) The regime is anchored in our legal system, which we cannot break down. Inherent therein is a moral obligation to restore the monetary                                                  8  For more discussion of the IMF proposal, see Pål Winje (2002): “Gjeldsordning for land (Sovereign debt restructuring)”, Penger og Kreditt 4/2002, Norges Bank. 9  Henrik Bahr (1962): “ Høyesteretts dom i gullklausulsaken (The Supreme Court’s ruling in the gold clause case)”, Lov og Rett, Norsk Juridisk Tidsskrift, No. 5.

system to its previous condition. (…) This is a question of fundamental importance to the nation through time. The difficulties that arise in connection with the transition to normal, legal conditions are transient. No one can close his eyes to the fact they are very serious. But the life of the people is eternal and this involves a decision of significance across generations.”10  4. What is a sustainable sovereign debt load? A debt level that is high in one country can be sustainable for another. When Norway experienced payment difficulties in 1816, government debt stood at 6 million speciedaler, or about NOK 700 million at today’s value of the krone, and was probably considerably smaller than annual GDP in the country at that time.  Germany met its tolerance threshold after World War I. The Treaty of Versailles obliged Germany to pay war reparations to the allies after the war. The total sum of reparations was estimated at twice Germany’s national income at the time. The annual payments, which were linked to export revenues, came to 5–6 per cent of Germany’s national product. The economist John Maynard Keynes argued that it was impossible for the country to make these payments and that the reparations demanded would have fatal consequences, not only for Germany, but for all of Europe.  “I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.”11  The countries that have defaulted on debt in the past two decades have systematically experienced problems when debt has reached around 50 per cent of GDP. Today, average sovereign debt for advanced economies is around 80 per cent of GDP. Japan’s gross public debt – one of the world’s wealthiest nations – is almost 220 per cent of GDP, but given its considerable assets net debt is about 110 per cent of GDP.12  Sustainability of government debt is to a large extent determined by a country’s governance system, tax system and growth capacity. Developed democracies with sound public financial management and solid institutions have a considerable capacity to collect taxes to service debt. In developing countries and emerging economies, where tax collection and institutions are weaker, debt tolerance is lower. In addition, borrowing costs tend to be higher. On the other hand, they have greater scope for growing out of high debt. (See Chart: Debt at the time of default.) When the euro area was established, the Growth and Stability Pact stipulated that a country’s budget deficit should not exceed 3 per cent of GDP and that debt should not exceed 60 per cent of GDP. When France and Germany were among the first countries to breech the criteria in 2003, the rules of the game were changed. This influenced the discipline of the other member states. It would almost seem that several countries viewed the limits as a floor rather than a ceiling.                                                    10  Sejersted, Francis (1973): Ideal, teori og virkelighet.

The crisis set in motion a dangerous debt dynamic, which can be illustrated by the following simple formula13:     where changes in public debt (on the left) are determined by the variables on the right: the interest rate on the debt, nominal economic growth in the country and the budget surplus or deficit excluding interest expenses, referred to as the primary balance. If the changes in debt (left side) are set at zero, the right side of the formula yields various conditions that must be met to achieve stable sovereign debt. If the interest rate is equal to GDP growth, the debt will be stable when the government budget excluding interest expenses is in balance. If the interest rate is higher than the rate of growth, the debt burden will be heavier and the government budget will have to be settled in surplus before interest payments. If GDP growth is higher than the interest rate, the country’s economy can grow out of its problems and sovereign debt will remain stable even with some degree of fiscal deficit.  The formula also provides an answer to the question of why sovereign debt rose so rapidly in many countries. The term indicated by the circle is known as the snowball effect and depends on the difference between the interest rate level and GDP growth. Low growth or a fall in GDP results in a rising debt burden. When debt approaches an unsustainable level, investors will demand higher compensation for new loans and interest rates on loans will rise, hence the snowball effect. (See Chart: Fiscal deficit and Public debt.) Large deficits have a direct impact on sovereign debt. From 2007 to 2010, fiscal deficits in euro area countries rose from 0.6 per cent of GDP to 6.6 per cent. In the same period, public debt rose from 66 per cent of GDP to 85 per cent, and there are prospects that debt will approach 100 per cent of GDP in the next few years. Fiscal deficits in the UK and the US will reach 11–12 per cent this year and public debt is rising rapidly to high levels. In order to rein in this development, fiscal tightening must be implemented and government budgets must be brought into surplus. This can be particularly costly in downturns. Several European countries have recently announced tax increases and cuts in expenditure. This typically involves raising the retirement age, broad-based wage reductions and lower welfare spending. These sharp measures may well boost growth capacity in these countries in the long term, but in the short run they will result in lower demand for goods and services and probably lower activity. Since several countries are tightening fiscal policy at the same time, export markets may also shrink. However, reduced fiscal deficits will hopefully restore confidence in economic policy so that growth in household and corporate consumption and investment resumes. (See Chart: Sweden and Finland in the 1990s.) There are examples of heavily indebted countries that have stopped the snowballing process before it led to default. The banking crisis in the early 1990s left Sweden with a substantial fiscal deficit. Lower tax revenues, increased social security expenditure and rescue measures for banks brought the deficit close to 11 per cent of GDP in 1993. Sweden’s public debt rose to 80 per cent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation continued for several years and resulted in stabilisation of government debt and provided room for its eventual reduction. The                                                  13  See Michael Hoel and Jan F. Qvigstad (1986): “Statsgjelden – et problem når veksten er lav og renten er høy (Public debt – a problem when growth is low and interest rates high)”, Sosialøkonomen, and Unni Larsen and Bente Støholen (2010): “Public finances – the difficult path back to sustainable levels”, Economic Commentaries 2/2010, Norges Bank. BIS Review 123/2010 7 
UK and Finland conducted a similar process in the 1990s. The Nordic countries in crisis at that time learned their lesson and have kept public finances in order during this crisis. The euro area countries are in a special position. They have a common currency and a common monetary policy. Governments raise loans in the area’s single currency. Monetary policy – management of the euro’s value – is a common policy, conducted by the European Central Bank with a view to maintaining price stability. The countries have common guidelines for fiscal policy, but as mentioned earlier, these have not been followed. On the contrary, lack of discipline has been inherent in the system.  Confidence in monetary policy and general economic policy has been strong in the area and thanks to this confidence – and as free riders –  countries have been able to raise loans at low interest rates. A committee headed by Herman Van Rompuey, President of the European Council, is assessing how coordination and monitoring of EU economic policy in the various countries can be improved. The goal is to reduce deficits and at the same time ensure that conditions are favourable for future economic growth.  Without stretching the comparison too far, management of public finances in euro area countries can perhaps be compared to the management of Norwegian counties and municipalities. Under the law, they cannot go bankrupt. The government stands behind them. They have access to funding markets and can make use of the Norwegian central government’s creditworthiness. There is an obvious temptation here to borrow too much – to act as free riders – that is reminiscent of the temptation faced by the euro area states. But the Norwegian system is balanced. If local government administrations in Norway borrow too much, the central government intervenes.  Municipalities and counties with a budget imbalance must apply to the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development for approval when decisions are made on borrowing or long-term leasing agreements. The county governor, as representative of the state, supervises the municipalities. About 10 per cent of Norwegian municipalities are currently in this position and are on the Norwegian ROBEK list.14  A firm hand such as this is lacking in the euro area.  5. The Norwegian government’s long-term obligations The Norwegian government’s financial position contrasts sharply with developments abroad. While government debt in Europe is approaching 100 per cent of GDP, the Norwegian government has net financial assets exceeding 100 per cent of GDP. We have been lucky because we discovered oil and gas. The Norwegian state with its large territory – or should we say territorial waters – has been adept at reaping the economic rent from petroleum activities and managed to set aside a large portion of our petroleum revenues. Although the Norwegian government is not in a net debt position, it does have obligations under welfare schemes. These are not liabilities in the same legal sense as debt, but nor are they schemes that can easily be changed. The Supreme Court has established that future national insurance entitlements are protected, in principle, by Article 97 of the Norwegian Constitution prohibiting legislation with retroactive effect, but that changes to national insurance entitlements will only be in contravention of the Constitution if they are “clearly unreasonable or unjust”.15 This gives the political authorities the freedom to adjust their obligations. Public occupational pension schemes seem to enjoy slightly stronger constitutional protection than national insurance pensions, but the Supreme Court has                                                  14  ROBEK – register of all municipal and county authorities subject to approval pursuant to Section 60 of the Local Government Act. 15  See discussion in Appendix 5 to the Report of the Pension Commission (NOU 2004:1). 8 BIS Review 123/2010 
repeatedly stressed the authorities’ need for freedom of action when it comes to making changes to pension schemes.  The Norwegian national insurance scheme is a pay-as-you-go system. This means that a given year’s pension payments from the scheme are covered by government budget revenues that year. When the national insurance scheme was introduced in 1967, a fund was established to provide for an expected reduction in private saving. However, pensions were still included in the central government budget at an early stage and financed by current tax revenues. Transfers to the National Insurance Fund were soon discontinued.  Nevertheless, confidence in the pension system has actually remained intact, reflected in a low level of household saving, primarily through home investment. Perhaps there is some element of miscalculation here. A fall in value may occur if many homeowners free up housing capital to cushion old age. (See Chart: Government Pension Fund Global.) It was only when transfers to the Petroleum Fund were introduced in 1996 that funds were accumulated that could also be used to cover future pension payments. The Fund, which has since changed its name to the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), has grown to almost NOK 3 000 billion. Its rapid growth was neither expected nor planned and was due to the sharp improvement in government finances during the economic upturn from the late 1990s. After the turn of the millennium, the rise in oil prices also provided a boost.  The size of the Fund is now equivalent to approximately 18 months’ mainland GDP and may double in the next five to ten years. Total public expenditure is equivalent to less than half of total GDP. If the government spends 4 per cent of the Fund annually – the expected real return – this will finance close to 20 per cent of public expenditure ten years ahead. The return on the Fund will by then have become such an important source of funding that it is difficult to imagine that the government authorities would find any sound arguments for drawing on the accumulated capital. It is also a flow of revenues that does not have an adverse effect on private sector production capacity, unlike taxes. (See Chart: Pension obligations and the Government Pension Fund.) However, only a share of future pension payments will be matched by revenues from the Government Pension Fund. The Government Pension Fund is estimated to cover around half of the national insurance scheme’s retirement and disability pension obligations.16 (See Chart: Pension costs and expected fund returns.) Over the next few years, the return on the Pension Fund is expected to rise roughly in line with government expenditure on retirement pensions through the national insurance scheme. Revenues from petroleum activities will nonetheless gradually decline, pulling down growth in the Fund. Over time, therefore, the national insurance scheme’s retirement pensions will grow considerably faster than the expected real return on the Fund. (See Chart: Generational account.) However, it is wrong simply to compare the Pension Fund and obligations under the national insurance scheme. The government has the option of taxing households and businesses, and this naturally also has a considerable net present value. Generational accounts allow for this. These accounts show whether there is a need to raise taxes or lower expenditure for the government budget to balance in the long term, based on forecasts for benefit and pension payments and oil revenues. The generational accounts reveal that there is currently a need for fiscal tightening equivalent to 10 per cent of GDP or of the order of NOK 200 billion. Long-term forecasts from the Ministry of Finance, that also take the pension reform into account, show a shortfall of around 6 per cent of mainland GDP. Calculations by professors Alf Erling Risa and Erling Vårdal here in Bergen paint a similar picture. The need for fiscal tightening roughly corresponds to current spending of oil revenues. Estimates of this kind are highly                                                  16  Revised National Budget 2010. BIS Review 123/2010 9 
uncertain by their very nature and, as we can see, have varied over time. Although Norway is in a stronger starting position than other industrialised countries, with considerable wealth at the government’s disposal, these calculations show that there are certainly clouds on the horizon.  Increases in oil revenue spending cannot be sustained for much longer. Production of oil and gas will decline. At the same time, we have been through a period where the need for welfare services has been relatively stable. The dependency ratio has shown little change. Demographic developments will not be as favourable in the coming decades. Although we have built sound institutions for the management of our petroleum wealth, it is too early to say whether Norway is managing its wealth soundly. It could easily slip. And although there has now been considerable pressure to increase oil revenue spending, there is good reason to believe that future generations will feel that we could have set aside even more.  Thank you for your attention. 10 BIS Review 123/2010

Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell: The interplay of banking, financial intermediation and regulation Speech by Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the 13th Conference of the European Central Bank–Center for Financial Studies (ECB–CFS) Research Network on “Macro-prudential Regulation as an Approach to Contain Systemic Risk: Economic Foundations, Diagnostic Tools and Policy Instruments”, Frankfurt am Main, 27 September 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a real pleasure for me to speak today at the 13th Conference of the ECB–CFS Research Network on “Macro-prudential Regulation as an Approach to Contain Systemic Risk”. The Roman senator and historian Tacitus tells us that in 33 A.D. the Roman Empire suffered a major financial crisis. The trigger was a re-establishment of laws that Julius Caesar had introduced as a war measure in 49 B.C. to prevent the flight of capital abroad and the fall of land values. After having been disregarded for a long time the re-introduction of the laws, which forced lenders to invest a large share of their capital in domestic real estate, triggered a scramble for money as many loans were called in. The disastrous effect was a postponement of investment and a fall in real estate values, compounded by investors withholding funding in view of the prospect of finding better bargains in a falling market. The crisis was eventually ended when Emperor Tiberius arranged for three-year interest free loans to investors.  Although the global crisis of the last few years had little to do with drastic measures of war financing of the Roman kind, the involvement of real estate, elements of the transmission and aspects of the resolution still sound familiar. These analogies are not isolated examples. The long list of financial crises in human history and their parallels over time have been extensively documented.1 One of the key issues – today and in history – has been that there were limited means to contain the systemic dimension of crises. Hence, the recent focus on macro-prudential supervision and the topic chosen for this conference. The regulation of systemic risk is very topical.  In my remarks today, I would like to look a bit more at the issue how financial regulation should react to instances of widespread or systemic instability. I shall do that from two angles: First, I want to look back at regulatory reactions in the past, namely the Glass-Steagall Act in the United States and the establishment of the Basel Committee and its standards at the international level, and, second, I want to consider the particular challenges we are facing for the current regulatory reforms. How has regulatory policy reacted to the occurrence of financial instabilities in the past?  One prominent example is the regulatory reaction to the stock market crash in 1929, which resulted in the establishment of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Act was to a large extent motivated by concerns about the role of banks in the run up to the Great Depression and in particular about conflicts of interest between the lending, underwriting and proprietary trading                                                  1  See, for example, Kindleberger (1978), Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, New York: Basic Books, Garber (2000), Famous First Bubbles: The Fundamentals of Early Manias, Cambridge: MIT Press, or Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly, Princeton: Princeton University Press.

functions. Therefore, the Glass Steagall Act banned commercial banks from underwriting, holding or dealing in corporate securities, hence essentially separating investment from commercial banks. The Act not only had a major impact on the evolution of banking in the US, but also worldwide. For instance, the emergence of large US investment banks, also with dependencies in Europe, is a direct consequence from the implementation of this Act. The Act also affected the supervision of banks worldwide. Owing to their funding structure based on deposits by many small and relatively uninformed agents, hence the possibility of a bank run and their involvement in the payment system, commercial banks were regulated relatively heavily. In contrast, investment banks were regarded to need less close public monitoring and regulation, as they were seen to be less important from an overall financial stability perspective and mostly the domain of sophisticated investors. However, the crisis has shown that all actors in the financial system contributed to the build up of systemic risk.  Research on the pre-Glass-Steagall-era in the United States provides evidence that securities underwritten by commercial banks’ subsidiaries did not have a higher probability of default than those underwritten by investment banks.2 However, whether the Glass Steagall Act has contributed or not to financial stability is an open question. Nonetheless, in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the Glass Steagall Act on the grounds that this would allow banks to become more competitive, attain favorable economies of scope and diversify their sources of income. However, the recent regulatory reform in the US under the Frank-Dodd Bill has re-introduced some restrictions on proprietary trading by deposit taking institutions.  A regulatory response with a worldwide impact on regulatory standards and banks’ business was the creation of the Basel Committee. The failure of the German Herstatt bank led to serious spill-overs to the US banking sector. In late 1974, central bankers from Canada, Japan, the US and 9 European countries founded a new body at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, which became later known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  This new organization was founded on the understanding that the increasing cross-border activities of banks and the associated risk that financial instability would be transmitted across borders required improvements in the quality of supervision and regulation globally as well as greater international cooperation in this field. Over the years it has increasingly developed into a standard-setting body and although its standards – such as Basel I and Basel II – are not legally enforceable they have in fact become the worldwide benchmark.  The list of factors that contributed to the financial crisis is long. However, irrespective of the multiplicity of factors, we had to realize that the provisions put in place by Basel I and Basel II were not sufficient to ensure the necessary resilience of the banking sector needed to withstand a situation like the one we are currently facing. In my view, the major lessons from the current crisis for any future regulatory policy are the following:  First, Basel II rested on the principle that the purpose of regulation is to ensure the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions against the risk of loss on their assets. However ensuring the soundness of each individual institution does not necessarily ensure the soundness of the financial system as a whole.                                                  2  Puri, M.

Second, the crisis has highlighted that the main types of risk, notably credit, market and liquidity risk are ultimately linked, and that funding liquidity of banks is an essential element of determining their resilience. Awareness about the importance of regulating liquidity risk was limited until the crisis brought it to the fore. And third, part of banks’ risk taking activities were left to other, non-bank entities of the financial system and, thus, these activities were able to escape the regulatory web that had been built for banks.  Already from these three points we see how the lessons learnt lead us to the systemic dimension of supervision and regulation. The current regulatory challenge So let me turn to the challenges of the current regulatory reform to discuss what is needed to prevent or contain financial instabilities and systemic crises in the future. These challenges concern three major fields: (i) classic bank regulation, (ii) market and infrastructure regulation, and (iii) systemic risk regulation. Regulating banks  Concerning the bank regulation, major progress has been made. The Basel Committee has just published the regulatory reform package known as Basel III. It addresses the weaknesses brought to the fore by the crisis. The aim of the Basel III reform is to enhance capital regulation and to introduce liquidity regulation. In particular the Basel Committee proposes: first, to improve the quality and quantity of capital, especially Tier-1 capital to improve loss-absorption on a going concern basis; second, to introduce a non-risk-based leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk control framework; third, to introduce capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning to ensure that the financial system absorbs the shocks and thus lowers the volatility of the financial and real economic cycles; finally, to elevate resilience of financial institutions to liquidity stresses by introducing a liquidity risk framework, improving liquidity risk management and harmonising liquidity risk supervision.  The significance of internationally coordinated oversight and the cross-border web of dependencies in the financial system are exemplified by systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) that often operate internationally. These played a major role in both the impact and the transmission of the crisis. In order to increase long term financial stability there is the need to reduce the moral hazard they exhibit. To address this, policy recommendations are being developed that include: (i) a framework for measuring an institution’s systemic importance, (ii) resolution tools and frameworks for the effective resolution of financial failures without taxpayers ultimately bearing the burden, as well as (iii) prudential and structural policy tools to reduce the probability and impact of SIFI’s failure. Looking further ahead, important challenges remain to improve banking sector stability:  First, banks’ business models need to become more sustainable. In my view, banks’ business strategy should not be directed towards increasing short-term profits by way of taking on extensive risks to the detriment of the long term viability of their business. In fact, the level of announced profit targets and their impact on peer banks has also to be seen from the perspective that higher profits mean higher risk taking and, hence, do not necessarily originate from efficiency gains alone.  Second, I believe that it is crucial for banks to undergo a serious reform of their corporate governance and compensation schemes. In particular, the incentives of traders, CEOs and creditors of the bank should adequately reflect the risks involved so as to internalize the costs of their risk taking and potential failure. This can be achieved through BIS Review 123/2010 3 
appropriate compensation schemes, more transparency vis-à-vis creditors and shareholders and generally improved oversight of banks’ business. Overall, the managing board of a bank has to shift the focus away from short-term objectives towards a longer term corporate strategy. This also includes being more accountable for the risk taking of the overall business of the bank, which brings me to the next challenge. Third, risk management practises need to be improved. Most risk management techniques – not just used by banks but also by rating agencies – neglected the correlations of risks across securities and did not sufficiently internalize the growing systemic (credit, market and liquidity) risks.3 Moreover, banks underestimated tail risk. The existing risk management techniques worked well at predicting small day-to-day losses under normal circumstances but failed to predict severe losses that are very infrequent. However, it is exactly those severe losses that matter the most. Therefore, banks need to devote greater attention to their risk management. This means in particular that the risk management function needs to receive a more prominent role in the organizational structure, specifically with respect to authority and independence.  Regulating markets and infrastructures Concerning the regulation of financial markets, the crisis has clearly shown that turbulences in one segment of financial markets can create spill-overs and contagion to other segments. Moreover, we have seen that both banks and other types of financial intermediaries had been seriously affected by the financial crisis. Therefore, I welcome the recent agreement to establish three pan-European micro-prudential supervisory authorities – the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). They are expected to become operational at the beginning of next year.  With regard to the regulation of market infrastructures, let me first say that I see it as a great achievement that market infrastructures have fared very well. They were able to withstand the shock-waves of the current crisis and continued to ensure the clearing and settlement of financial transactions. Thus, they contributed critically to containing the spreading of financial instability. This resilience, however, was not a “dues ex machine”. It was the outcome of well designed international standards for market infrastructures. Still, we need to closely analyse the lessons from the crisis also in this area – e.g. in terms of market infrastructure risk management and transparency and the arrangements for cross-border cooperation among authorities. These lessons will be incorporated in the global CPSS-IOSCO recommendations for financial market infrastructures to be issued early next year. Despite the good performance of market infrastructures, there is a need to further develop highly resilient market infrastructures, particularly in the field of OTC derivatives. The crisis showed that legislation, supervision and oversight of global derivatives market arrangements need to be improved – and that this needs to be done in a consistent way globally. Following agreement by the G20 on high-level objectives, new legislation has recently been introduced in the US and is in an advanced stage in the European Union. Such legislation stipulates, inter alia, that all OTC derivatives trades will need to be reported to trade repositories and to the extent possible be subject to central clearing via a central counterparty (CCP).  Overall, also with regard to regulating markets and infrastructures, important challenges remain:                                                  3  Danielsson, Jon, Paul Embrechts, Charles Goodhart, Con Keating, Felix Muennich, Olivier Renault and Hyun Song Shin (2001) “An Academic Response to Basel II’’ Financial Market Group special paper 130, London School of Economics. 4 BIS Review 123/2010 
First, striving for more transparency in financial markets. The activities in the shadow banking sector and the over-the-counter business have contributed tremendously to the creation of uncertainties and opaque transmission channels for risks. Therefore, a central goal for any future regulatory action should the improvement of market transparency. Clearing of OTC derivatives via CCPs, the reporting of derivative trade data to trade repositories and the recent proposal by the European Commission to increase transparency for shortselling activities are important steps in the right direction.  Second, dealing with financial innovation. Independently of the doubtless benefits of financial innovation, it poses a constant challenge to regulators, supervisors and overseers of financial markets and infrastructures. The banking business is in a constant state of flux with new financial instruments constantly being developed and traded. New techniques and instruments have been developed, particularly to diversify and trade credit risk, making markets more complex and sometimes less transparent. For example, the risks involved in the so-called “Originate to Distribute” model – an intermediation approach in which banks originate, repackage and then sell their loans (or other assets such as bonds or credit risk exposures) on to the financial market – was insufficiently recognized by market participants and supervisory authorities. Therefore, financial innovation and growing complexity mean that market participants and authorities need to constantly build up in-depth knowledge of financial innovations and broaden their analysis across the whole spectrum of financial market actions.  Third, minimization of risk transmission between institutions and markets. Given the resilience of market infrastructures in the current crisis, we need to further strengthen and encourage their use. Moreover, the crisis has shown that the exclusive focus on banks has proven insufficient as contagion has also occurred across different types of financial intermediaries, such as insurance companies and money market funds. Therefore, looking forward it will be crucial that the cross border cooperation between authorities be further strengthened. In this respect the work of the newly created European Supervisory Authorities will be key. Looking more into the interrelation between markets from a systemic perspective will be another key task, which brings me to the third major field of regulatory challenge, namely regulating systemic risk. Regulating systemic risk As indicated, traditional banking regulation was designed to limit each individual institution’s risk seen in isolation. It did not sufficiently focus on systemic risk, put simply, the risk of a simultaneous collapse of institutions. Institutionally, significant progress has been made in the strengthening of macro- and micro-prudential supervision. In Europe, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and – as mentioned – three pan-European micro Supervisors will be established.  The ESRB will provide a thorough analysis of systemic risks to the financial system in the European Union and will issue warnings if significant risks are identified. It will also provide policy recommendations to address these risks and prevent a renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole. With its involvement in the ESRB, the ECB will continue to play an active role in safeguarding financial stability in Europe. The ECB Vice President will go into greater detail at tonight’s conference dinner on how we are preparing for that task.  The main challenges that I see ahead in the area of regulating systemic risk are as follows: First, determining the perimeter of regulation. It is important that the regulatory web is cast wide enough to ensure that all systemically important institutions, markets and products are captured. Caution is also necessary to avoid that tighter regulation simply shifts activities to unregulated market segments or entities. Therefore, the steps taken towards more harmonised banking supervision as well as the progress made in Europe towards a Directive BIS Review 123/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 123/2010                                                 on alternative investment fund managers, which affect financial markets through their tight web of interlinkages with the financial sector, are appreciated.  Second, ensuring the availability of information and data. The detection and the early warning on systemic risk crucially depends on the quality and the availability of relevant data as well as on the adequate assessment of the risk bearing capacity of the system. Therefore it is important that information is made available that can feed into future assessments of systemic risk, especially in view of this being a key input into the working of the newly founded ESRB. In this regard, it will be equally important that the use of qualitative data and market information is strengthened and that this information will be fed into the regular analysis of systemic risk in a more systematic way. And third, measuring systemic risk. A basic difficulty in regulating system risk relate to the difficulty in measuring the contribution of individual institutions to systemic risk. The importance of an institution for systemic risk is a function of its size, interconnectedness and substitutability. One way for regulators and private markets to be able to monitor financial institutions and to assess their systemic reach, is to assess the risk of multiple defaults. Measuring such risk is difficult, as measures may be too backward looking or face data limitations. I am happy that after the break we will have the chance to hear about the latest advances on how to measure systemic risk in the keynote speech by Professor Robert Engle from New York University. He has developed a measure of systemic risk capturing the systemic impact of an individual institution’s shortfall and which is published in the so-called NYU Stern Systemic Risk Ranking.  The keynote speech will be followed by two outstanding papers on measuring systemic risk. Kim and Giesecke will present a paper estimating systemic risk on the basis of actual defaults and the timing of their occurrence. The paper by Yang and Zhou goes beyond the usual focus on the existence of contagion and will present an analysis of the pattern of propagation across financial institutions.  For an illustration showing how big the challenge to identify systemic risk is, one does not need to go back very far in history. In 2003, a young analyst in New York stated the following:  “You just have to watch for the level at which a nearly unlimited or unprecedented credit growth can no longer drive housing markets higher. I am extremely bearish and feel the consequence could be a 50% drop in residential real estate in the US. A large portion of the current [housing] demand at current prices would disappear if only people were convinced that prices were not rising. The collateral damage is likely to be of orders of magnitude worse than anyone now considers”.4 It took another 4 years that these risks and, particularly, the systemic impact and costs materialized. Analyzing systemic risk means, therefore, mainly going beyond mainstream thinking and challenging widespread beliefs. We are in need of the type of analyst I just quoted. I am very much looking forward to hearing this conference’s analysis on the containment of such systemic risk, the future challenges and the possible policy options we have going forward.   4  Quote from M.

BIS Review 122/2010 1 Guy Quaden: Modernising IMF surveillance Intervention by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, at the International Monetary Fund–Monetary Authority of Singapore (IMF–MAS) Conference  “The IMF and the international financial system: the post crisis agenda”, Singapore, 24 September 2010. *      *      * First of all, I would like to thank the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the IMF for inviting me to contribute to this high-level conference.  The world economy has changed in important ways. Capital flows now dwarf trade flows. Many economies are now integrated into world capital markets. Financial sectors have become more interconnected and a channel for rapid transmission of crises across regions and at a global level. This requires Fund surveillance (in other words its crisis prevention role) to adapt both in substance (what surveillance should do) and modalities (how to do it). I would like to focus on three major topics: 1. the analysis of financial sector stability must be strengthened both at global and country level; 2. bilateral surveillance must be complemented with multilateral surveillance; 3. the so-called traction of Fund surveillance – the ability and willingness of countries to heed Fund advise – must be improved. Let me elaborate. Financial sector stability issues The international community has drawn many important lessons from the recent financial crisis. Implementing the needed changes has only just begun. The Basel III Agreement, reached only recently, is a major step to make the banking sector more stable and better equipped to absorb losses. It is only a first step. Improving capital adequacy primarily focuses on the stability of individual banks. It is foremost an instrument of micro-prudential regulation. Compliance of individual banks with prudential regulations does not assure the stability of the system as a whole. Macro-financial stability concerns must be kept under constant review and addressed by national institutions – the central banks – with a clear mandate. In the European Union, the European Systemic Risk Board will be established next year and assume an important role at EU-wide-level. However, the implementation of its recommendations will remain largely the responsibility of national authorities. I see an evident parallelism and potential for synergy between the surveillance mandate of the ESRB and IMF surveillance, the latter remaining broader in scope. After a series of national and regional crises (Mexico, Asia, Russia, ...) the IMF Board adopted in 2000 a Financial Sector Assessment Program. The Fund would at regular intervals (of 3 to 5 years) conduct an in depth evaluation of the vulnerabilities of a country’s financial sector and the adequacy of prudential regulation and surveillance. However, the membership could not agree, in a straightforward manner, that financial sector stability was an integral part of Fund surveillance, and therefore mandatory. The technical assistance nature of FSAPs was used by some countries to argue that the Fund should prioritise its resources to countries less equipped to conduct sound financial sector policies. As a consequence, some major systemically important financial sectors that proved very vulnerable did not undergo a timely and sufficiently in-depth scrutiny. 
2 BIS Review 122/2010 Last Tuesday, the IMF Board decided that the 25 countries with a systemically important financial sector will undergo at least every 5 years an in-depth assessment of their financial sector. Moreover, the Board has stressed that financial sector policies are important in all cases of bilateral surveillance. This is a significant progress.  Multilateral surveillance Bilateral surveillance, understandably, focuses on how national policies must be conducted in the country’s best interest. The premise is simple: if each country achieves internal stability and a sustainable external position without manipulating exchange rates, the system as a whole will function satisfactorily. While this remains largely valid, trade and financial integration and economic interdependence are now so far advanced that national economic interests must be pursued in a shared framework of collective stability. National policies pursued in the country’s own best (short term) interest might not be collectively consistent. The problem of the persistent global imbalances is an important example. To complement bilateral surveillance, the Fund must formulate policy-oriented advice on how to improve the coherence of national policies toward improved collective stability and sustainable global growth.  A promising proposal that has been floated recently is the production of spillover reports. It is to be welcomed that the Fund plans to prepare, on a trial basis over the next year, at least three spillover reports for the US, the euro area and China. These reports will focus on outward spillovers of domestic policies of these economies and would involve not only the authorities of these economies (akin to the contact for the regular Article IV consultations) but also the authorities of the economies affected by the policies.  The launch of the first Mutual Assessment Process (MAP) by the G20, in collaboration with the IMF, is a new attempt at multilateral cooperation and coordination. Given the potential benefits, this objective should be pursued with determination. However, the effectiveness of the G20 process still needs to be demonstrated going forward. Moreover, many special topics affecting groups of countries that may include non-G20 members or only a few of the G20 members will remain uncovered in that G20 process. The IMFC could provide a forum for addressing these issues. Prioritization and collaboration The improvement of surveillance will require adequate resources and Fund members should not withhold them. But it is obvious that choices will have to be made among a very wide range of ideas; and priorities will have to be set. This should happen taking into account in particular the effectiveness and cost of each proposal and the work done by other international institutions. When considering the creation of IMF surveillance products, sufficient attention should be devoted to the integration of these products in the overall IMF surveillance framework in order to maximise the effectiveness of and the synergy among all these products. The Fund has indeed already a large array of surveillance instruments (at bilateral, regional and multilateral level: Article IV, FSAPs, WEO, GFSR, REO, EWE, Vulnerability Exercises in EMs, Multilateral Consultations ...) which are the result of its efforts to keep its relevance in a changing world. At the same time, close cooperation with other international institutions and fora is essential, taking due account of comparative advantages and expertise, and avoiding duplication of efforts. Regarding, for instance, financial stability surveillance, the IMF and the FSB work together on the Early Warning Exercise and on systemically important financial institutions. Nevertheless, there remains probably room to improve further the coordination of their activities. In retrospect, we have to admit that the record of both the FSF and the IMF was less than perfect. The Fund has also to collaborate efficiently with the Basel institutions: with 
BIS Review 122/2010 3 the BIS, that produces high-quality macrofinancial research, and with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, given that it has much responsibility for micro-financial issues. Another proposal which is gaining attention is to tailor further the content and frequency of the surveillance process according to the specific circumstances of each member country, and thus also according to the systemic importance of the country concerned. While I can certainly see merit in this proposal, it should be kept in mind that surveillance is important for all countries and that all members have the right to receive adequate policy advice during regular Article IV consultations. Tailoring consultations to specific circumstances should not lead to diverging surveillance quality for different categories of members. Traction of Fund surveillance I come to my last topic: the so-called traction of Fund surveillance. With highly competent economic analysts in central banks and governments in most countries, some have questioned the usefulness of Fund surveillance. Such is not my view. The added value of Fund surveillance rests on the political independence of the Fund opinion. Like independent central banks, Fund experts put longer term considerations above short term political calculus. In doing so, the Fund steers policy makers toward more honesty and boosts the government’s ability to implement often politically difficult reforms. There is a debate about how transparency can help improve traction of Fund surveillance. Prior to the Mexican crisis in 1994, IMF surveillance reports were highly confidential. Today, all Article IV reports, with a few exceptions, are available on the Fund’s website. For the Fund, the challenge in this context, is to be perceived as an impartial advisor and monitor, not too tied by its structure to the official view in which problems are downplayed1. Let’s be frank. The IMF must indeed avoid public clashes about short term emergencies. On this, candid analysis is only acceptable if treated with the needed degree of confidentiality. Full and unfettered transparency could on the contrary induce complacency and a loss of credibility for the Fund. However, at the same time, the IMF must become more pro-active in persuading public opinion, social partners, and NGOs of the long-term costs of unadjusted policies and of the long-term gains that will outweigh short-term pain. Explanation by a credible international institution that promotes a global common good, might find more support from the public for long-term objectives than politicians believe there is.2  Much has been said and written on improving the governance of the IMF and enhance ministerial involvement. Many observers conclude that nothing really happens at the international meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. This perception is not entirely unfounded. As I see it, the central task of ministers and governors meeting in the IMF is to seriously discuss policy-oriented multilateral surveillance reports. This is a task that the IMF Executive Board can only prepare. In the end, it is up to the policymakers at the highest level to agree on how consistency among their policies can be promoted, and policy coordination improved. Pursuing these objectives will elevate the level of ambition of Fund surveillance and the cooperation of its members to a higher level than that exists now. Today’s conference should advance our ambition.                                                  1  Cfr. for instance the interview of Professor Reinhart published for the attention of the IMF staff in November 2009. 2  Cfr. for instance Raghuram Rajan, Fault lines, page 215. 
BIS Review 122/2010 1 Sada Reddy: Promoting microfinance in Fiji Opening speech by Mr Sada Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the third Microfinance Expo, Labasa, 24 September 2010. *      *      * The Commissioner Northern, Lieutenant Colonel Inia Seruiratu Labasa Town Administrator Mr. Vijay Chand Microfinance clients and entrepreneurs Representatives of banks and financial institutions Government agencies and NGOs People of Labasa Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen Introductory remarks Bula si’a and a very good morning to you all.  It is a real pleasure for me to be here today in Labasa on this occasion. The reception we received since arriving yesterday has been overwhelming. Indeed the people of this region live up to your reputation as “the Friendly North”.  I am sure that the Macuata Province is still celebrating its rugby team’s successful challenge and promotion to play amongst the big boys in the 2011 Digicel Cup, after the win over the Namosi rugby team last weekend. Congratulations and well done!  We have been monitoring with much anticipation the developments that have been taking place here in the North. We want to be part of it and this is the reason we are here today. I wish to acknowledge the tremendous support we have received from the Commissioner Northern’s Office and all the stakeholders here today in organizing this event. Thank you very much!  This is the third Microfinance Expo organized by the Reserve Bank this year. The support and co-ordination that we have received in all three have been fantastic. Our partners are here again today – the banks, financial institutions, the non-bank financial institutions, investment agencies, government agencies, mobile network operators, NGOs, MFIs, the NCSMED and the micro enterprises. All combine their efforts to promote greater awareness about financial inclusion and microfinance. It is a good example of the public, private sectors and civil society partnership towards common goals. Results are produced through such coordination and understanding. At the end of the day, it is the general population that will benefit from such collaboration.  Why promote microfinance? Some of you may be wondering why the Reserve Bank of Fiji is so keen on promoting microfinance. Various studies on microfinance around the world have shown the significant improvement in the lives of people through the outreach of microfinance. It has:  contributed significantly in tackling poverty;  seen improvements in housing, health & sanitation;  resulted in better access to education; and   more particularly the empowerment & participation of women in social and economic activities.  
2 BIS Review 122/2010 So you see, we are interested for the simple reason that microfinance can play a key role in the economic development and wellbeing of our people and country. We believe that through microfinance, many of the poor and unbaked in our communities will have the opportunity to access financial services to improve their living standards. Ladies and gentlemen, microfinance is not only about loans. It also includes savings, payments, micro insurance services and capacity building of clients. I hope that at the end of our Expo, the people of Labasa would be better informed about these financial services. Not only that, but we would like to see new micro business initiatives spring up, resulting in improved living standards. The theme for this third microfinance expo is “Inspiring Growth through Microfinance”. When we look at statistics, the informal sector, which includes small and micro-entrepreneurs, contributes around 17percent of our GDP.1 In some Asian countries, this particular sector form around 60–80 percent of GDP. You can see then that there is a lot that can be done to develop the microfinance and small business sector to become a major contributor to the development and growth of our country.  The North can contribute to this objective. Labasa, as well as the entire Northern Division has become a national priority in Government’s current development focus. There is availability of vast untapped resources in the Northern Division.  With proper policies and support in place, these resources can be harnessed to produce business opportunities and source of living for the people in this region. The Government is keen on realizing this. We intend to visit some projects under the Northern Development initiatives today. We have heard some encouraging developments and will see them whilst we are here. RBF policies to support and promote microfinance In the last 17 months, you may have noticed that the Reserve Bank has implemented a number of new initiatives to promote microfinance and greater financial inclusion in Fiji.  In April 2009 a new department was established in the Bank, the Financial Systems Development and Compliance Group. This Group has been tasked with spearheading developments in the areas of microfinance, financial literacy, remittances, complaints management, capital markets and payments systems. To develop microfinance in Fiji, the Reserve Bank issued a policy in December last year to all commercial banks to establish microfinance units at all their branches by January this year. These banks are all participating at this Expo and you can talk to their staff to find out more on the services and products they offer. In February this year the RBF facilitated the establishment of the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce – an apex body of stakeholders from the public, private sectors and civil society in implementing targeted strategies to promote greater financial inclusion, and has taken on the leadership role.  The goal of this Taskforce is “to reach 150,000 unbanked clients by 2014 through a nationally coordinated effort, supported by a variety of financial service providers, offering a broad range of relevant, accessible, affordable and cost effective financial services.”  I am pleased to say that good progress has been made on this front. Both the mobile phone network operators in Fiji, Vodafone and Digicel have complemented the microfinance initiatives by recently launching their mobile money financial services, with the approval of                                                  1 Source: Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics (2009 GDP Release as at September 2010). 
BIS Review 122/2010 3 the Reserve Bank. New services and products are available and more are expected in the market. New innovations, vision and new technology have enabled this.  In June this year, the Reserve Bank, in partnership with stakeholders, hosted the first microfinance expo in Ba. The second Expo was in Suva during the 2010 Hibiscus Festival. We had set-up a Microfinance Village during the Festival to promote microfinance and financial literacy. A green ribbon campaign was launched that same week to promote financial literacy. As usual, our partners were with us during the occasion. It is pleasing to see that the commercial banks, are now actively participating in microfinance programs. We hope that these new services and products will make financial services more accessible and affordable. Another area that the Reserve Bank has been actively promoting is local value adding and import substitution, especially with fruits and vegetables. We hope that this is an area that many of our rural farmers here in the North can actively engage in. I believe the Department of Agriculture officials will be available over the next two days to assist those of you who may have questions and need assistance. We also sponsored a Chef this year for a two month attachment in Malaysia at a five star hotel to study the use of local produce in hotel menus. He returned in August and we have collaborated with TPAF to organize a two day commercial cooking workshop at the Takia Hotel, where this Chef will conduct training. Training is open to school leavers, professional chefs, or budding home based caterers.  To support local value adding and small business development we have also collaborated with the Ministry of Women and the Indonesian Government in facilitating a training workshop for women on making handcrafts utilizing batik, bamboo and coconuts.  We hope that the two workshops today will enable participants to learn about creating income generating activities that could be used to start a small business. We also have on hand commercial banks and microfinance institutions that offer free financial literacy trainings and advice on their products and services. Of course, we have also invited the micro entrepreneurs to come and sell their wares at this expo. You can extend your support to these entrepreneurs.  Conclusion We hope that you will invite and encourage as many of your friends and families to come down and enjoy the wide variety of goods and services available from the different stakeholders.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a rare opportunity; we have brought microfinance and financial literacy to your door-step. I hope you will grab this opportunity. This occasion is also meant to be educational and fun. Apart from the abundance of useful information and products by the institutions represented, there are also lots giveaways for the children and the entire family. With these words I declare the Labasa 2010 Microfinance open. Thank you. 
BIS Review 121/2010 1 Subir Gokarn: Perspectives on financial sector strategy Keynote address by Dr Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the High Level Panel on Opportunities and Challenges for Financial Services in India and Europe, New Delhi, 20 September 2010. *      *      * The inputs of B.M. Misra, Pallavi Chavan and Rakhe P.B. in preparation of this address are gratefully acknowledged. I welcome this initiative by the Asia-Europe Business Forum to organize a discussion on opportunities and challenges for financial services in our respective regions. Virtually all significant debate that is taking place today on financial sector regulation and development, whether in advanced or emerging economies, is placed in the context of the crisis and the role that the financial sector played in it. However, there is a significant asymmetry in that debate, as is evidenced, for example, in the discussions on post-crisis financial regulatory strategies in the G20 process. It is by now fairly clear that significant differences in regulatory frameworks across countries contributed to very different outcomes in terms of both the role of national financial sectors in the crisis and, in turn, the impact of the crisis on the financial sectors themselves. Within the G20 process, this has resulted in concerns about a “one-size-fits-all” regulatory response to the crisis. However, on a more constructive note, it has also contributed to the emergence of a collective view on balancing the role of the financial sector in the development process with the need for global co-ordination on regulation in the face of increasing global integration of both financial systems and economies as a whole. This “emerging market perspective” was the subject of a seminar organized in Seoul as a prelude to the recent G20 Finance Deputies meeting in Gwangju, Korea, earlier this month. I believe that this perspective provides an important foundation for sustaining a meaningful dialogue between advanced and emerging economies, of which this forum is an example.  In this brief keynote address, I would like to put forward some thoughts on the broad principles that guide our thinking on financial sector development and which have shaped our contributions to the “emerging market perspective” that I referred to earlier. On previous occasions, I have articulated four basic principles: efficiency, stability, transparency and inclusion. An effective strategy would need to balance the objectives implicit in the four principles by, first, exploiting the complementarities between them and second, recognizing the tradeoffs and, wherever they arise, prioritizing between objectives. Let me elaborate on the “opportunities” and “challenges” provided by each set of objectives.  As regards efficiency, there is little doubt that the financial system needs to meet the expanding and increasingly complex requirements of a rapidly growing economy; more so, it needs to meet them in as cost-effective a manner as possible. Given the imperatives of speed, a number of factors can be brought to bear on this. New capacity combined with greater competition is clearly one way to achieve this objective. New ways of addressing specific needs, for example, through the development of new markets and new products is another. However, it is important to recognize that the efficiency of the financial system cannot be viewed in isolation. There must be a concrete link between the development of the economy and the capacity and the capability of the financial system.  Clearly, as we think about rapid increases in both capacity and capability, the role of foreign institutions needs to be considered with reference to their ability to bring both capital and knowledge to the table. However, the benefits that greater foreign participation may generate have to be balanced against their potential to increase risks. This brings us directly to the second principle, stability. Financial stability, explicitly or implicitly, has always been an objective of both governments and central banks and this was quite vividly demonstrated in the response to the crisis on 2008. Since then, what was perhaps more implicit than explicit is now sought to be formalized and institutionalized in many countries, including India. The 
2 BIS Review 121/2010 mechanisms needed to both pre-empt and deal with systemic risks and their materialization are being seriously debated. From a broad emerging market perspective, the question of how the significant presence of large foreign players contributes to systemic risk is a critical one as regulatory and prudential strategies are designed in the post-crisis environment. How do we exploit the benefits that they offer with respect to the broad developmental objectives without making our own systems vulnerable to shocks that emanate outside and over whose transmission we have little or no control? A balance needs to be maintained between ownership, governance and prudential norms that satisfy reasonable systemic safety requirements and commercial viability, which will make it worthwhile for these institutions to expand or set up business.  I would like to emphasize that the stability principle is not confined exclusively to foreign presence. Systemic risks can originate in domestic financial players as well. An effective safeguard mechanism must identify all possible sources of such risks and put in place appropriate measures.  Transparency is a critical requirement of a globally integrating financial system. Standardizing and harmonizing reporting norms will help to bring about global comparability, which, in turn, will help national regulators identify the vulnerabilities of their systems and take necessary steps to prevent the precipitation of a crisis. However, while this is a desirable objective, the process of convergence is itself resource and knowledge intensive. Cross-border comparability will remain a problem as different countries converge gradually to the global standards. Even after it happens, mechanisms that ensure the full dissemination of information need to be instituted or strengthened to derive the full benefits of comparability.  Finally, on the issue of inclusion, this is clearly an objective at the core of the larger development agenda. It is not easy, even for people within the system, to appreciate the sheer scale of the challenge. It is not just a question of numbers. The imperative is to provide financial access to several hundred million people in widely differing local environments in terms of levels of affluence, economic structures and means of livelihood, risks emanating from both natural and man-made sources and infrastructure conditions. This requires a deep understanding of the local terrain and the organizational ability to find cost-effective ways to cater to the requirements of financial services in each terrain.  There are, of course, some universal or replicable components, which are either already in play or will become so shortly. Saturation coverage by the telecommunication network allows the use of low-cost wireless handheld devices to actually play the role of a bank branch, significantly reducing the cost of expansion. The impending introduction of the Unique Identification Number will significantly improve the efficiency of the KYC process as well as allowing full mobility across the networks of individual banks. But, given the overall scale of the challenge, as well as its regional diversity, properly visualizing the role of different participants and coordinating their activities will be of critical importance. And all this will have to be done with full consideration of cost-effectiveness, commercial viability and, of course, the implications of any strategy for financial stability. In short, robust development of our financial sector in a manner consistent with the larger goals of economic development needs to balance these four principles. It needs to exploit complementarities and manage tradeoffs. Let me list three current areas of activity, which reflect this overall approach.  First, the process of issuing new banking licenses has begun, with the articulation of core issues and the pros and cons associated with ownership and capital criteria. A public debate and consultation process is now under way. Second, an effort to co-ordinate action on the remaining barriers to the development of the bond market is in motion. A very important motivation for this is the sharp rise in infrastructure spending and the need to ensure that this is not hindered by financial constraints. Third, a process of consultation with individual banks with the objective of developing realistic financial inclusion plans is going on.  I will conclude by highlighting three balancing acts that our financial sector development strategy needs to perform:  
BIS Review 121/2010 3 1. Between the drivers of financial sector growth and the requirements of the larger growth and development agenda  2. Between the benefits and risks of greater global integration  3. Between the advantages of scale and the compulsions of diversity  I trust that these thoughts will be a useful input into the discussions that follow and I thank the organizers of this Panel for the opportunity to share them with you. 
BIS Review 121/2010 1 Andrew Bailey: Financial reform Remarks by Mr Andrew Bailey, Executive Director for Banking Services and Chief Cashier of the Bank of England, at the Lord Mayor’s City Banquet, London, 21 September 2010. *      *      * My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. Can I thank you Lord Mayor on behalf of the Bank of England for inviting us to contribute to your regulatory Banquet. Adair and I first met in our current roles when he was literally I think in his first day on the job, which was incidentally the weekend of the resolution of Bradford and Bingley. It is a great relief that the experience of that weekend did not cause him to have second thoughts, because we have all benefited from the leadership that he has provided since then. On the subject of the time of year, I should add that being here in September, enjoying your hospitality Lord Mayor is a distinct improvement on some recent Septembers when we were recovering banks. An evening at Mansion House beats the pizza and all night session at the Bank of England by a very long way.  I am going to speak tonight about why the public interest in the stability of the financial system matters to all of us. Calmer times are the necessary environment for the task of re-building financial stability. It is a task that belongs to all of us, and it is certainly not just the task of regulators, central banks, or the authorities more generally. We cannot achieve and maintain financial stability on our own. Above all, it requires recognition of the public interest in financial stability.  Thirteen years ago, at the annual banquet for the Bankers and Merchants of the City, in June 1997, just over a month after the Election of that year, commenting on the new regulatory arrangements, the then Governor of the Bank, Eddie George, said that the direction of financial services regulation was driven in part “by a rising tide of public expectations in terms of both the prudential and the behavioural standards required of financial intermediaries”. Eddie George was undoubtedly correct that the public will and should expect more in terms of the standard of business of firms. But history now tells us – painfully – that on the way to higher standards there was a terrible lapse in which too many people in our industry forgot that preserving financial stability is the duty that we all owe to the public. The fact of the matter is that the public has every right to expect us to act in their interest.  This means that we cannot have attitudes which put short-term gain first on the basis that the stability of the financial system can be tomorrow’s objective, for the next person. But in order to achieve this, we need to be very clear on the benefits of financial stability. One of the questions I get asked most frequently is how we will ensure that the lessons of the crisis stick. We can only achieve this if the case for financial stability is well understood. There is a very clear parallel here with monetary policy. The success of monetary policy is founded on public acceptance of the benefits of sustained low inflation. That did not come easily, as the experiences of the 1970s taught. But once that public acceptance and interest started to become embedded, the task of monetary policy became easier – not easy, but easier. In this important sense, no such policy making apparatus can be independent of the will and interest of the public. And nor is the task of ensuring public acceptance ever finished. Monetary policy has demonstrated that a firmly established and lasting institutional framework for policy making is a necessity.  But exactly what is the public interest in financial stability? This can be a harder question to answer than for monetary policy, because financial stability cannot be so readily summarised in a statistical series. There is a temptation to generalise that you certainly know it when it isn’t there. I think there are at least four things that the public should want as part of the overall stability of the financial system. First, that they can have confidence in the safety and soundness of the institutions that hold their money and savings and write policies to protect 
2 BIS Review 121/2010 them against risks. Second, that those institutions have the capacity to undertake the stable and sound provision of financial services to the economy, including of course lending. Third, that the system does not do business and exist on the basis of an implicit commitment that the State will have to use public money, the public’s money, to bail out firms that get into trouble. And fourth, that the public can place trust in firms and markets based on their reputations and the transparency of their dealings. Regulation is important and it can help to foster that trust, but it cannot substitute for the trust that the public needs to have, in firms and markets. The State is not there to support the industry, and regulators are not there to substitute for trust in and the reputation of firms and markets.  Some important principles follow from the identification of the public interest in financial stability. First, a competitive financial system can only exist if it is rooted in stability: competition and stability cannot be traded off in a binary sense. Second, the public should not define financial stability as preventing all financial firms from failing. In other sectors of the economy firms fail without putting at risk the funds of the public or taxpayers’ money. We will not truly have solved the too big or important to fail problem and thus the public money problem until we have tools at our disposal which enable us to resolve large institutions if they get into trouble. This will create the right incentives for risk management. And third, regulators must use their judgement to mount a robust challenge to stop dangerous business models and investment practices. This last point is vital. Financial services is an industry where arbitraging rules and regulations is habitual, even addictive. Money is made this way. We have no desire unduly to suppress enterprise and innovation, but doing the right thing and preserving financial stability means accepting the spirit of the rules. This is not a small change. Let me give you one important example. The new Basel agreement emphasises loss-bearing capital – capital that can bear losses outside insolvency. It must stay that way, and not be chipped away under the banner of arbitrage masquerading as innovation. I have been asked a number of times in the last week whether I think that the new Basel agreement sets capital requirements high enough. My answer is that if the capital buffers are in future genuinely loss bearing capital with no tricky wrinkles, and we keep to this outcome, we have taken a good step forward. Sadly, that was not the case with Basel 1 in the late 1980s when I started out as a banking supervisor.  The consultation document on regulatory reform in the UK published by the Government at the end of July emphasised the need for a judgement-focused approach by regulators “so that business models can be challenged, risks identified and actions taken to preserve stability”. What does this mean?  A primary focus of the new Prudential Regulation Authority will be on determining whether the business models, governance and systems and controls of firms will enable them to satisfy the public interest in financial stability in future states of the world. That requires both a macro and micro prudential view, and for the two to come together to reach forward-looking judgements on whether financial stability is likely to be preserved in a range of plausible future outcomes. This range of outcomes is important, and it also underlines the need to build up the role of stress testing. Such testing is an important mechanism for describing the forward-looking view though it should continue to evolve from a binary pass-fail world into one where it is a toolkit to test a range of possible future states of the world and thereby judge the wider resilience of firms.  The PRA will exercise judgement in the supervisory actions it takes, so that firms are likely to be able to meet its objectives, policies and rules over the medium term horizon. Firms will need to demonstrate to the PRA that they are robust to a variety of states of the world, including unanticipated stress scenarios. However, since it is not possible for any forecast to cover all possible outcomes, there will always be some probability of firms failing. Working with the Bank of England’s Resolution team, the PRA will need closely to integrate recovery and resolution planning within its supervision; and in my view should embed a proactive intervention framework akin to the US Prompt Corrective Action within its supervisory approach to deal with the inevitable situations where firms get into the danger zone. Above 
BIS Review 121/2010 3 all, these tools should support competition in the industry, by accepting that there will be winners and losers.  In two years’ time, we will have a new system of financial regulation in the UK. Those of us involved can assure you that the transition is not a small task, but I can also assure you that the Bank is fully committed to working with the FSA to ensure a smooth transition.  There is a great deal to be done to implement the new system of regulation, to articulate and build the public interest in financial stability, and thereby to improve the stability of the system itself. Basel III, macroprudential tools, countercyclical buffers, are all things that Adair and I get excited about. They are important foundations of good policy. But on their own they don’t win the public interest argument for financial stability. To do that, we have to build the case that the industry will serve the needs and interest of the public. The authorities cannot do this alone. Building confidence in the financial system takes effort and time. It is a common goal and in the interest of everyone.  Lord Mayor, the government of the City of London is an important part of the fabric of financial services, and we appreciate all that you do to support the industry and the objective of stability in the financial system. It is therefore my great pleasure to propose a toast to the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress. 
BIS Review 120/2010 1 Jean-Claude Trichet: The entry of Estonia into the euro area Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Euro Conference at the Bank of Estonia, Tallinn, 20 September 2010. *      *      * Distinguished guests,  Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here today, in Tallinn, to participate in the Euro Conference. On 1 January 2011 the euro will become legal tender in Estonia, and Estonia will become the 17th country to join the euro area. Let me first congratulate all parties involved in this outstanding achievement on their efforts and determination to prepare Estonia for the adoption of the euro. The creation of the single currency has been a very important step forward in the achievement of the historical endeavour of creating a single market for the Europeans, which was what the founding fathers had in mind more than fifty years ago. Its inception has been, at the same time, a powerful symbol of the will of the European countries to pursue actively their strategic road towards unification. We were eleven countries when we started the euro on 1 January 1999. We will be seventeen on 1 January 2011. There is no better way to demonstrate that the euro area is not a “closed shop” but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner. 1 January 2011 will become a landmark in the history of Estonia, reflecting the long and challenging process of economic and monetary integration that has enabled Estonia to join the euro area. After regaining independence in 1991, Estonia embarked on a rapid and far-reaching programme of social and economic reform. In addition to being a determined reformer, it became a model for stable multi-party democracy. Estonia transformed itself into a dynamic economy, gaining recognition for its sound fiscal record, economic freedom and capacity to develop new technologies. For several years, Estonia was also one the world’s fastest growing economies, but its growth was far from balanced. Notwithstanding some very difficult years following its regaining of independence, Estonia’s real GDP grew at an average rate of 7.2% per annum over the period from 1995 to 2007. However, this growth rate came to a halt in 2008. Real output declined sharply in 2008 and 2009, and, after Latvia, Estonia became the second most severely affected EU Member State in terms of output decline. The severity of the adjustment revealed that the period of rapid output growth was, to some extent, also a period of imbalanced growth and economic overheating. During the years of economic expansion, strong domestic demand was the main driving force behind economic growth, with domestic demand itself being fuelled by, among other things, rapid increases in real disposable income, and overly optimistic expectations about future income. The significant financial inflows into Estonia fuelled credit growth and increases in asset prices, notably in housing markets, with the resulting imbalances then being unwound in the context of a severe recession. In addition, the very rapid growth of real GDP in the Estonian economy until 2008 resulted in the accumulation of sizeable, double-digit current and capital account deficit to GDP ratios. Booming domestic demand and capacity constraints supported an unsustainable rise in unit labour costs, with a cumulative increase of over 50% during the period from 2000 to 2007. The strong increase in wages outpaced productivity gains and had a negative impact on the competitiveness of the economy.  Today, as we look forward to the introduction of the euro in Estonia, I would like to point out two key aspects of the country’s experience on its road to adopting the euro. The Estonian experience may encourage some euro area countries to tackle the pressing need for 
2 BIS Review 120/2010 adjustment that they currently face and inspire Estonia, as well as current and other prospective euro area countries, to contribute to a sustainable functioning of Economic and Monetary Union in the years ahead.  The first key aspect refers to the importance of maintaining a sound fiscal record. Even during exceptional times, Estonia has demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining sound national fiscal policies, which are a crucial element of the policy framework for Economic and Monetary Union. There has been a clear consensus in Estonia that fiscal consolidation should never be compromised. Indeed, despite the significant degree of uncertainty about the recovery of both external and domestic demand, the Estonian authorities implemented significant fiscal consolidation measures in 2009. This was a strong advantage for Estonia in its efforts to join the euro area. Indeed, the country’s fiscal policy record since 1992 supports the view that prudence is a key element of its fiscal policy.  The second key aspect of Estonia’s experience refers to the importance of both the effective prevention and, if necessary, decisive correction of economic imbalances. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Estonia’s overall policy stance should have been tighter in order to contain demand pressures and the emergence of significant macroeconomic imbalances during the time of very fast growth. This is particularly true over the period from 2005 to 2007, when the overheating pressures became most apparent. Efforts to reduce wage growth and contain rapid credit growth during that period also proved largely ineffective. In the end, the macroeconomic imbalances accumulated by the Estonian economy were quite significant, and the magnitude and speed of the adjustment that followed were indeed dramatic. However, the Estonian economy, and the citizens that support it, adapted rather quickly to the new economic environment, proving a remarkable capacity for adjustment. This speaks for the flexibility of Estonia’s economy and the “alertness” of its people. The new economic environment required prompt, determined action and the adoption of difficult policy measures. The implementation of such measures contributed to Estonia’s prudent fiscal record and the rapid unwinding of the external and internal imbalances that had built up during the boom years. Competitiveness is gradually being restored and the current and capital account balance has recorded a surplus since the beginning of 2009. The adjustment of nominal wages has been, and will continue to be, an essential element of the gradual correction of competitiveness losses and the return to sustainable output growth. Developments in the public sector, where nominal wages declined by around 10% in 2009, contributed to the adjustment of wages in the economy as a whole. Sustainable wage dynamics, with increases in line with productivity progress, will continue to be crucial to restoring competitiveness and maintaining a low inflation environment. Encouragingly, Estonia’s economic recession appears to be over, but as you know, this is no time for complacency. With this in mind, it will be particularly important for Estonia and other euro area countries to support the reallocation of domestic resources to export-oriented, high value added sectors in order to ensure a return to sustainable external positions. To encourage sustainable job creation, it is important to ensure that wages remain sufficiently flexible. Finally – but crucially from the ECB’s perspective – the Estonian authorities must remain alert, and take forceful action if necessary, to ensure that the low inflation environment that has been achieved in the recent past is sustained over the years to come.  The experiences of Estonia and various euro area countries over the past few years highlight the importance of rigorous and effective surveillance inside the single currency area. In line with the Treaty, the ECB attaches great importance to the notion of sustainability. A country must only be eligible to adopt the euro when it has achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence and its economy is in a position to fully reap the benefits of joining the euro area. A lack of sustainability would inevitably result in serious economic challenges for the newcomer and would possibly also have negative consequences for other euro area countries, or even for the euro area as a whole. That is why a thorough and diligent approach 
BIS Review 120/2010 3 to ensuring adherence to the convergence criteria on a sustainable basis is in the interests of all current and prospective euro area countries.  In order to fully reap the benefits of the euro and to allow adjustment mechanisms to operate efficiently within the enlarged euro area, it is essential that Estonia adopt appropriate policies, thereby contributing to robust economic growth on a sustainable basis. The success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers. Against this background, we, at the ECB, welcome the commitment by the Estonian authorities to ensure, after the introduction of the euro, an economic environment conducive to sustainable output and employment growth, with balanced macroeconomic conditions, including price stability.  I am also confident that Estonia, as the newest member of the “euro area family”, will make an important contribution to a strong and effective governance framework at the EU and euro area levels, thus helping to ensure that the implementation of sound economic policies is closely scrutinised. Recently, the ECB has set out a number of proposals for reinforcing economic governance in the euro area1. These proposals, which are to be followed up by the Task Force chaired by President Van Rompuy, identify what is needed to strengthen governance and enforcement structures in the economic policy framework for the euro area. They require a “quantum leap” in terms of progress towards strengthening the institutional foundations of Economic and Monetary Union. It should contribute to a deeper economic union that is commensurate with the degree of economic integration and interdependency already achieved through monetary union. The introduction of a new currency also represents a logistical challenge which requires careful preparation. Great efforts have been, and will continue to be, made to ensure that the people of Estonia are well-informed about the euro banknotes and coins, and in particular the banknotes’ security features. I am confident that the very close cooperation between the ECB and Eesti Pank that has been achieved over the last few years under the leadership of Governor Lipstok, and the cooperation that will continue into the future, will make a significant contribution to the smooth and successful introduction of the euro in Estonia.  We look forward to welcoming Estonia into the euro area! Thank you very much for your attention.                                                  1 See “Reinforcing economic governance in the euro area”, available on the ECB’s website (www.ecb.europa.eu). 
BIS Review 120/2010 1 Umayya Toukan: The international monetary system – too big to fail Speech by Mr Umayya Toukan, Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan, at the 34th Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on “Macroeconomic policy: post-crisis”, Session 6, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 28 August 2010. *      *      * The international monetary system: too big to fail I am extremely honored to be asked to speak on such an important topic and before such a distinguished audience and I wish to thank Tom Hoenig for giving me this opportunity. I am also very proud to be on this panel. Some years back, and throughout my dissertation work which was under the able guidance of Frederic Mishkin, Maurice Obstfeld went beyond the call of duty to respond to my many inquiries. I wish, once again, to express to Professor Obstfeld my feelings of gratitude. John Lipsky has been giving me valuable advice on matters of monetary policy and bank supervision in my country and I wish to thank him and his team at the International Monetary Fund. There is no shortage of justifications to the call for the reform of the International Monetary System (IMS). The justifications referred to can be sorted out under two categories: the macro policies of member countries and the imperfections of the Bretton Woods system. Macro policies of member countries include such policies as running massive deficits or intervening in foreign exchange markets. On the other hand, commentators agree that the Bretton Woods system did not function as originally planned. After 1973, the IMS seem to have reverted to a more market oriented, hybrid and voluntary system as opposed to a system characterized by IMF surveillance and supported by IMF facilities. In my remarks today, I will attempt to relate the above mentioned issues to three sets of interrelated but at times conflicting considerations: (i) national vs. international considerations (ii) political vs. economic considerations. (iii) Public policy vs. market considerations. Given that seven countries are currently dollarized or have currency boards using the dollar, and 89 countries have pegged exchange rates using the dollar as an anchor1, it is clear that the macro policies of the main reserve currency country have a huge impact not only on the countries just mentioned but also on the rest of the developed world. It is equally important to appreciate the perception of vulnerability by the countries whose currencies are pegged to a major reserve currency and the consequent need to accumulate reserves as self insurance2. The global current account imbalances and the resulting volatility of capital inflows did have several serious consequences, some of which, were blamed for the recent global economic and financial crisis3. Considerable volatility in capital flows, and the associated “liquidity shocks” can create strong need to accumulate reserves. Commentators generally agree that, in the case of oil exporters and China, reserves holdings exceed conceivable precautionary needs, and reflect more the state of the still developing financial markets in those countries as well as the desire to boost policy credibility4. The move to a flexible exchange rate regime by advanced economies was expected to help clear global imbalances. That expectation has not been fully met for several reasons. First, public policy choices for some countries continue to put off important structural adjustments.                                                  1 Reinhart and Rogoff 2004. 2 Aizenman and Sun 2009. 3 Kohn, 2010. 4 Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor, 2009. 
2 BIS Review 120/2010 Furthermore, a number of emerging economies did not allow their currencies to float freely, and continued to defend their peg at an undervalued exchange rate. Those modes of behavior beg in the issue of how to deal with protectionist sentiments. We have a light hearted question in our region which asks: why did God choose to send the prophets of all three religions to the Middle East? And the answer is: it was impossible to get them a Schengen visa. Divine wisdom aside, protectionism, in its broadest sense, continues to be a major challenge to global coordination. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, last year alone, 450 “low intensity” protectionist measures were taken by the G20 members5. With fiscal consolidation in many countries and an almost jobless growth, countries may continue to resort to increasing exports to create jobs. Consequently, the risk of competitive devaluations, through intervention or otherwise, may be growing. The plausible assumption for the persistence of protectionist sentiments is that countries who take protectionist measures do so to protect their “national interest ”. Similarly, one may also assume that the competitive devaluations of the 1930s were intended to protect the national interests of the countries concerned. The outcome of the events of the 1930s and their aftermath clearly do not support the fine objective of this line of reasoning neither do the present imbalances and the present market volatility. And it is not only public policy that tends to overvalue national interest and undervalue international interests but also the market mechanism seems to produce a similar outcome. An interesting argument in support of this view was presented in the Per Jacobson lecture last June in Basle6 and I quote “...there is a nationalist bias in the pro-market revolution...” unquote. Given the dominance of globalization and the interdependence of financial markets, it may seem paradoxical that there is still that much difficulty in reconciling national and international interests. To sum up on this point: I think the Bretton Woods institutions and indeed the United Nations system were designed to reconcile national interest with global interests and to ensure the mutual consistency of national policies7. The fixed but adjustable peg and later on the floating or managed exchange rates regime were supposed to take care of imbalances in the current account. The prevailing hybrid system of exchange rates could not clear the current account and imbalances continue to persist. The good news is that IMF surveillance proved to be invaluable in the case of deficit developing countries. Since the late 1980s, we have introduced several key structural reforms in Jordan based on IMF surveillance and IMF consultations. More recently, the FSAP reviews helped us introduce several key reforms in the financial sector. Other developing countries may have gone through the same exercise. In this regard, the IMF can play an important role in the ongoing regulatory and financial reform efforts on both sides of the Atlantic. Furthermore, the call for more legitimacy in representation or quotas may enhance the multilateral role of the IMF and meet the concerns regarding IMF governance. More importantly, I suggest that enabling the IMF to provide international liquidity when needed with schemes that establish a “Global Financial Safety Net” and expanding its mandate in the light of the recent global crisis to include macrofinancial surveillance and spillover analysis should be seriously considered. In general, I would suggest that strengthening the IMF with some enforcement mechanism, such as Keynes original idea of a global clearing bank, would restore to the international monetary system some needed ownership and credibility. I believe it was the late Charles Kindleberger8 who said that the international financial system will not work unless somebody should take responsibility for it. Finally on this point, it is also essential for the IMF to                                                  5 Saccomanni, 2010. 6 Tommaso, 2010. 7 Carney, 2009. 8 Landau, 2010. 
BIS Review 120/2010 3 enhance its collaboration with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). A major criticism against the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944 is that it separated economics and politics in “water tight ” compartments according to Richard Gardner in his very interesting book “Sterling Dollar Diplomacy9”. In this regard, political policy choices can continue to put off adjustment in surplus countries. How any reformed international monetary system can bring about the needed consistency between economic and political considerations will be a major challenge for the global community in the coming years. The global crisis and the fact that it started in the US may have led some to believe that the current IMS model of using the dollar as the global key currency has been undermined. Moreover, recent sovereign debt problems in Europe raised doubts about the Euro and whether a single currency, with limited political integration, and little fiscal coordination among member countries, could be sustainable. In this regard, I suggest that most of the concerns are not totally justified. The dollar is backed by trust in the US political and economic system, the liquidity and depth of the US financial markets and the outstanding infrastructure for payments’ settlement. Moreover, and although the Euro has been around for only ten years, it is today associated with price stability. In this regard, I think major credit should go to the European Central Bank (ECB) and to President Trichet also for his consistent stand on the independence and integrity of the ECB. By definition, only currencies that can be freely convertible for trade or investment purposes have the potential to achieve the status of an international currency. Furthermore, the international use of currencies is a market-driven process which is determined by independent decisions of private agents and public policy. The criteria for Central Banks’ decisions on their foreign currency portfolios often differs from the considerations of private savings which may be more related to standard portfolio choice criteria. When the present international monetary system in its original form was agreed upon in 1944, it was expected that the dollar would be the main reserve currency. Over sixty years on, the dollar is still the main reserve currency. Any shift by central banks from holding dollar reserve assets risks large accounting loses. Structural reforms, in particular, in the area of medical care and entitlements as well as addressing what is often described as a savings glut or investment drought, are essential to restore balance to the global economy. Major reserve currency governments are responding to the calls for fiscal balance, higher savings, and more balanced investment spending at home. Other countries could also introduce more flexibility to the exchange rate of their currencies and allow relative prices to change. Fiscal policy in some emerging markets can also stimulate domestic demand away from exports and toward more consumption at home. This is all well known but I think it bears repetition. Before I conclude, I would like to present a quotation from a book about the history of the Bank for International Settlements in Basle10, when during one cold snowy December night in North Carolina, the author woke up on a power failure which, in his words, took him back to the 19th century and he realized that we take for granted so many things in life and I quote: “…the payments system is yet another example of a highly complex network technology. We take it for granted that our checks clear, ATMs instantly provide cash anywhere in the world, imports are paid for in the required currency, and the desired amount of liquidity is available to us any time at the lowest cost. In fact, we should marvel at the ordinarily smooth working of the international payments system rather than be surprised at its occasional malfunction...” unquote.                                                  9 Gardner, 1980. 10 Toniolo, 2005. 
4 BIS Review 120/2010 Clearly, the global crisis of the past two years is hardly an occasional malfunction. However, I would like to suggest that the Bretton Woods agreement and subsequent reforms did serve the global economy well since World War II. Furthermore, markets do work and even when they become dysfunctional, as we saw during the past 18 months or so, markets were sending a clear message for corrective action. Of course the coordinated non-conventional measures taken by major central banks, in particular the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the ECB, as well as action taken by governments, did save the global economy from a meltdown. The managing director of the IMF suggested last spring that 1/3 of the effectiveness of stimulus measures was due to global coordination. Those same measures taken individually may not have produced the same result. A quick review of all statements by ministers at the IMF meetings last spring would reveal that the terms “multilateralism”, “coordination” and “surveillance” were the most frequently used terms. At least one minister called for “compulsory multilateral coordinated surveillance”. The Ministers’ remarks were reflected in the “G-20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth” which emphasized the mutual assessment of members’ monetary, exchange rate, fiscal and financial policies with the assistance of the IMF and other international financial institutions. I started my remarks by referring to several inconsistencies which need to be reconciled by the global community and I would like to end my remarks by going back to basics. Central banks should continue to adhere to their medium term objective of price stability and governments should adhere to fiscal consolidation or the unwinding of fiscal deficits. Furthermore, an international agreement on a framework for financial sector reform should be arrived at. Maintaining central bank credibility as well as fiscal and regulatory credibility are essential to restore confidence to the IMS. However, it is still not clear how any reform mechanism can impose adjustment on surplus countries. Furthermore, it is not clear either, under any reformed system, how an international body can impose fiscal discipline on member countries. I would therefore fully subscribe to the view that “achieving a better balance will require lasting shifts in spending, production, saving and borrowing around the world11”. It would be ideal if the political-economic mix in public policy, especially in major economies, would be consistent in allowing the market to produce those shifts and for the countries concerned to conceive those shifts as being in their national interest. After all, if anything is too big to fail, it should be the International Monetary System. I thank you for your attention.

BIS Review 120/2010 1 Jean-Pierre Landau: International monetary arrangements Speech by Mr Jean-Pierre Landau, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, before the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee, Beijing, 6 September 2010. *      *      * Opinions expressed are solely mine and do not represent the views of Banque de France or the Eurosystem.  International financial and monetary arrangements are currently extensively debated. For many countries, both advanced and emerging, the crisis has shown that there is a close link between internal and international financial stability. In addition, rebalancing of the world economy stands at the forefront of the G20 policy agenda and there is a perception it may be difficult to achieve under current arrangements.  According to an apt definition, an international monetary system consists of (i) exchange rate arrangements; (ii) capital flows; and (iii) a collection of institutions, rules, and conventions that govern its operation (Carney, 2009). Explicit or implicit “rules of the games” form the backbone of such a system.  This is an ambitious approach and it may seem too normative to some. But it has a long history, starting with the gold standard, from which the phrase “rules of the games” originated. The Bretton Woods system itself was built around an elaborate framework of rules, disciplines and support mechanisms aimed at ensuring convertibility for the current account – but, crucially, not the capital account –, together with fixed but adjustable exchange rates.  With the generalisation of flexible exchange rate regimes, the normative approach to the international monetary system was somehow weakened. Capital account liberalisation led to entrust international financial markets with the “disciplining” function. When it became apparent that the discipline could often lead to abrupt capital flows reversal and crisis, the international community attempted to strengthen the IMF surveillance and develop its facilities so as to pre-empt such shocks and make them more manageable. That is, basically, where we are today.  Everything must be done to ensure that IMF surveillance works. But, like any “disciplinary” approach, it meets with three essential difficulties: first, diverging interests between countries; second, enforcement problems (the IMF has naturally more leverage on countries that need its help than on others). Finally there is a perception of asymmetry in IMF surveillance; it may be compounded by a more fundamental and natural asymmetry between surplus and deficit countries, when it comes to implementing adjustment measures. And, some would say, there might also be a de facto asymmetry between reserve and non reserve currencies, although, as I shall mention later, the situation is more subtle.  These difficulties were apparent during the last part of the 20th century. But what makes the “disciplinary” approach almost impracticable today are the changes that have occurred in the world at the turn of the 21st century. The world today stands in stark contrast with both the Bretton Woods era and the period that followed immediately:   The first – and most obvious – difference is the number of countries that are active participants to the system and have a stake in its functioning. The monetary and financial world is becoming increasingly “multipolar”. While the current system comprises three currency blocs, at least one (the Chinese RMB) and may be other additional systemic currencies will emerge in the future.   Second, those participants are more diverse from the point of view of their economic structure, their demography, their level of development, and, more importantly, their social choices and preferences. For instance, different saving rates may be seen as resulting from divergent time preferences. Likewise, asymmetries in financial 
2 BIS Review 120/2010 development may, to some extent, reflect different choices and tradeoffs between efficiency and stability in the organisation of capital markets and the architecture of financial systems.   Finally, linkages between economies, whether through trade, capital or more intangible “confidence” channels are continuously getting stronger as witnessed by the speed and amplitude of contagion of economic and financial shocks during the last eighteen months, which took everybody by surprise.  Pending some economic catastrophe, these characteristics will persist over time. A large number of different countries, with different preferences, will permanently be linked and interdependent through active, but imperfect capital markets. Any future international architecture must be compatible with those basic features of today’s world which, prima facie, create the potential for more complexity and, maybe, instability.  Therefore, when discussing international monetary arrangements, one must try and take a different view, encompassing all aspects of the financial interrelationships between nations. To a large extent, international monetary arrangements, as well as current account imbalances, are the by-products of policy choices made by countries on their capital account regimes and financial development. Here, I will focus on three topics: global imbalances, the provision of international liquidity and the newly emerging question of an international store of value. These are issues of joint and common interest for all countries, Getting to a common understanding on those matters would help in making progress on other, more contentious questions, such as exchange rates regimes.  Global imbalances and the policy agenda  Current account imbalances have increased both in amplitude and durability during the last decade. In fact, they have become a permanent characteristic of our economic environment.  Contemporary analysis point to “structural” causes behind the pattern of capital flows and global imbalances:  According to the “Bretton Woods II” approach (Dooley et al. 2003, 2008, 2009), the pattern of capital flows results from a mutually beneficial equilibrium between two groups of countries. On the one hand, emerging economies which follow an export-led development strategy and seek to prevent appreciation of their real exchange rates by constant foreign exchange intervention (together with capital controls). As a consequence, they accept to accumulate increasing stocks of liquid assets denominated in dollars. On the other hand, the US is happy to get both reserve inflows to finance their deficits and cheap imports to fuel their demand for consumption goods. Such equilibrium is stable by virtue of the mutual benefits it brings to both groups. Moreover, the more it lasts, the more it is impossible to change since both group become mutually dependant through the stock of claims and debts they have reciprocally accumulated. Any significant break, for instance, in the allocation of reserves by surplus countries, would both trigger major exchange and interest rate volatility in deficit countries and lead to significant valuation losses in surplus countries. This “financial balance of terror” is supposed to keep the system in place for a long period of time. Implicit behind this doctrine, however, is the assumption that the creditor country can live with the risk of losses on its reserves and accept that possibility as a price to pay for the success of its growth strategy.   A more recent explanation is provided by the “asset shortage” theory (Caballero, 2006), which helps and explains why asymmetries in financial developments generate both payment imbalances and asset bubbles. According to the theory, the world has a shortage of liquid and riskless assets. Moreover, the supply of those 
BIS Review 120/2010 3 assets is asymmetrically distributed between regions, with the US providing a large chunk of the total. Hence, there is a structural excess demand for dollar denominated securities, which sustains permanent capital inflows in the US. To the extent that the US financial system does not generate enough “pure” safe assets, this creates an incentive for the financial sector to manufacture such assets from the securitization of lower quality ones, but at the cost of greatly increased financial fragility (Caballero, 2009).  The policy consequences are important.  1. First, current account imbalances will likely prove more resilient than expected to exchange rate movements or inflexions in macro policies. If the causes are "structural”, significant shifts in demand and relative prices between countries may well lead to suboptimal growth and excess volatility. In the immediate future, “financing “ those imbalances should take precedence over their “adjustment”.  2. Second, global imbalances reflect a mix of different national preferences and inflexions caused by public interventions. One important focus in the policy debate should be to disentangle those two types of structural causes, and eliminate pure policy induced distortions. Obviously, this is no easy task, but, in the end, a crucial one if imbalances are to be addressed and reduced.  3. Finally, financial development matters. This is one area where preferences differ between nations and public policies have a huge impact. This is also a source of major uncertainty for the future. In a more diverse, multipolar world, interactions between countries with different financial systems will become more complex and, as the crisis has shown, very destabilizing.  Will there be a move towards liberalisation of capital accounts or will existing restrictions and controls be maintained in some parts of the world? Opening the capital account exposes countries to increased financial volatility. The impact, however, is different for capital importers and exporters. Capital importers face the possibility that flows would abruptly dry up, thus inflicting damaging shocks to their financial systems and national economies. Capital exporters accumulate claims on the outside world and, therefore, run the risk of valuation losses (through exposure to country and exchange rate risk). Ideally, an international open capital account regime would protect both capital importers towards sudden liquidity shocks and capital exporters toward abrupt changes in the value of their assets. These are potential avenues for progress and debate.  International liquidity  The crisis is a powerful reminder that liquidity – both domestic and international – can never be taken for granted. The provision of international liquidity has been severely disrupted. How will it be provided in the future, and by whom?  These are not new questions. In the recent period, Governor Zhu, from the People Bank of China has raised the issue of reserve currencies. According to Governor Zhu, current arrangements for liquidity provision are a source of instability and have played a role in causing the crisis. Governor Zhu has mentioned, in particular, the intrinsic contradiction embodied in the famous “Triffin dilemma”. Because the dollar is the major reserve currency, international liquidity supply depends on the US running a sufficiently large current account deficit which, by itself, aggravates global imbalances and creates instability. Governor Zhu suggested that the role and status of the SDR be enhanced, with the long term objective of creating a “super reserve” currency.  However, the Triffin dilemma goes back to a period when international capital markets were poorly developed. By then, international liquidity was limited to instruments used to settle payments between official monetary authorities. It was represented by claims on such official 
4 BIS Review 120/2010 entities. By contrast, in today’s world, most international liquidity is privately provided and represented by claims on private institutions. Interbank markets play a crucial role in this process. The more capital markets become integrated at the short end, the more international liquidity is provided by the private sector.  As a consequence, there is a strong continuity and complementarities between domestic and international liquidity. Both depend on the willingness of counterparties to extend credit to each other. Both are subject to aggregate supply and demand shocks with sudden shifts in risk aversion or liquidity preference. Both result from leveraging and deleveraging by private institutions (Adrian and Shin, 2008). When markets seize, counterparty risk is perceived as excessive, uncertainty settles in, financial institutions deleverage their positions towards non residents, and then international liquidity dries up and disappears.  When a shock occurs, public provision of liquidity has to substitute to private provision. In a domestic context, this is the function of the lender of last resort. But when the shortage is about foreign currency liquidity, this role has to be played by foreign exchange reserves.  Foreign exchange reserves In the last decade, emerging countries have constantly sought to expand their foreign exchange reserves. The emerging markets’ average reserve ratio has more than quintupled from 4 percent to over 20 percent of GDP since 1990 (Obstfeld et al. 2009, Matteo y Lagos et al., 2009).  One cannot assume, however, that equilibrium has been reached and that the demand for reserves will stabilize. On the contrary, there are strong indications that this trend will persist, or even be amplified, following the crisis.  How much reserves are enough? Theoretical reasoning would balance the benefits of holding reserves against their cost, with some notion that there is an optimum.  On the benefit side, reserves can be detained or accumulated for a variety of motives:   to smooth out the impact on consumption of shocks on the current account, which is the most basic and traditional motive, even in the absence of international capital flows   as a result or by-product of foreign market intervention to prevent exchange rate appreciation. This is usually defined as a “mercantilist” motive.   as precaution against possible abrupt capital outflows (the “sudden stop” syndrome)  The costs of holding reserves are also well identified:   there is a direct opportunity cost because foreign exchange reserves’ risk / return profile may be lower than for other, alternative, investments.   finally, as reserves accumulate, countries are getting increasingly exposed to exchange rate risk and face the possibility of significant valuation losses.  This traditional cost / benefit analysis seems less and less able, however, to account for the true behavior of reserve holders. During the crisis, foreign exchange reserves were used as a tool for internal – as well as external – financial stability. National Central Banks, especially in Latin America, acted as dollar lenders of last resort to their domestic banks. (Obstfeld et al. 2009).  This function will develop in the future. Financial openness and integration means that domestic banks will engage more and more into foreign currency operations. In turn, the expansion of their international balance sheets will increase the potential demand for liquidity support in case of shocks. This trend should be accepted as a normal consequence of open 
BIS Review 120/2010 5 capital markets and international banking, together with the predominance of a very limited number of currencies in international finance.  It is bound to impact the demand for reserves and increase the need for self insurance. One characteristic of liquidity shocks is that the net demand for liquidity may become almost infinite. Ex ante, no buffer is ever big enough. No amount of reserves will fully protect a financially open economy against a systemic shock. It is noticeable that countries, such as Korea, which possessed very important amounts of reserves prior to the crisis and has a flexible exchange rate regime, nevertheless felt the need to enter into currency swaps with the Federal Reserve.  In a sense, countries face the same dilemma as private institutions. They need liquidity in times of stress but it is costly to hold in normal times. Their reactions, however, are opposite. Private institutions tend to underestimate their liquidity needs because, in case of shock, the Central Bank can step in as a lender of last resort. For countries, the bias goes in the other direction. Provision of international liquidity, whether private or official, is contingent, conditional and uncertain. With no international lender of last resort, financial stability motives could lead to unlimited accumulation of liquidity. Internationalisation of finance has created a fundamental indeterminacy in the demand for reserves. As a consequence, past benchmarks used to assess the adequacy of reserves are no longer valid. Current research (Obstfeld et al. 2009 ) shows that broad domestic money aggregates may be the best explanatory factors for the amount of reserves. Multilateral provision of international liquidity: the search for financial safety nets  The rationale for a multilateral source of liquidity provision is straightforward: stabilizing the demand for international reserves would bring huge benefits in terms of world welfare.  At the moment, reserve accumulation can only occur through a conjunction of balance of payment surplus and some degree of exchange rate intervention and creates externalities for other countries.  Now, suppose there is “ex ante” an existing pool of reserve assets which countries could tap into under specific circumstances. If access to this pool is credible and predictable, there would be no need for getting those reserves from the market. This would reduce the incentive for countries to conduct a whole set of policies such as:   generating current account surpluses through active exchange rate management   ring fencing pools of liquidity and capital in local subsidiaries, therefore creating a potential segmentation of international financial markets.   implementing “soft” capital controls to limit the impact of shocks and diminish the need for reserves  All countries, therefore have a common interest in finding ways to disconnect reserve accumulation from exchange rate management and, more generally, from balance of payment situations and monetary policies. The need for national reserves could be reduced if credible mechanisms exist to provide for the supply of official liquidity on a multilateral basis. Significant progress has been achieved in this direction during the recent period. A dense network of forex swaps has been put into place between major Central Banks in the midst of the crisis. Other recent official initiatives include: the creation by the IMF of a new facility – the Flexible Credit Line – aimed at easing liquidity pressures on countries with no fundamental balance of payments difficulties; a new SDR allocation, the biggest ever, for the equivalent of 250 bn USD, which has been enacted by the IMF Executive Board.  These are, however, revocable and limited sources of liquidity provision. Swap agreements can be (and have been) terminated. Out of the total, only a small part of the SDR allocation 
6 BIS Review 120/2010 will benefit countries which may effectively need to use them. More may be needed to substitute for national foreign exchange reserves as a permanent insurance mechanism.  Contingent liquidity  The search for new liquidity sources meets with an inescapable moral hazard problem. On the one hand, to be equivalent to reserves going forward, multilateral liquidity must be available ex ante and without condition. On the other, there is a danger that fully unconditional liquidity be used to deal with fundamental “solvency” imbalances. In real life, this is not an easy distinction to make. The dilemma is solved, at the domestic level, by the provision of eligible collateral. This may prove very uneasy for international liquidity: transferring ownership of substantial amounts of sovereign assets between countries or to international institutions would meet with huge legal and political difficulties.  This is the rationale for conditionality. But, of course, conditionality creates an uncertainty which is incompatible with the purpose of instant supply of liquidity. A conditional facility will never be a perfect substitute for reserves. Many countries fully eligible to the Flexible Credit Line (FCL) have used foreign swaps instead. Anecdotal evidence suggests that swaps are often perceived as carrying less of a stigma effect.  One way to deal with moral hazard would be to distinguish explicitly between two different risks facing each country: on the one hand idiosyncratic risk, created by national policies and country specific shocks; on the other hand, “systemic” risk stemming from aggregate liquidity shocks occurring on a broader – global or regional – scale. Countries would self insure against idiosyncratic risk by holding a sufficient amount of reserves. Protection against systemic risk would come from a multilateral mechanism for international liquidity provision.  Of course, the distinction between idiosyncratic and systemic risk may be difficult and involves a broad degree of judgment. But two basic rules should be guiding future work on a multilateral safety net: (1) conditions for access should be specified ex ante; and (2) those conditions should be fully delinked from the situation of individual economies. Rather, they should depend on the state of the global economy and international financial markets. From the point of view of an individual country, access should be fully unconditional, once global conditions are met.  A considerable amount of work is currently devoted to devise instruments of contingent capital for financial institutions in times of crisis. The same intellectual framework can be extended to liquidity. What is needed is contingent liquidity i.e. liquidity available to nations in times of aggregate shocks to the international financial system. This raises two questions: where would such liquidity come from? How could it be mobilized?  As to the source, a possibility would be to create a process of periodic general allocation of SDRs, according to a predetermined schedule. Those SDRs, however, would not be immediately available for use by their beneficiaries. Rather, they would be “frozen” and unblocked only in pre – specified circumstances (Landau, 2009). Criteria for use would not be defined on the basis of individual countries’ situations, but on consideration of the conditions prevailing in the global economy and international capital markets. If properly constructed, such a scheme may provide, for no cost, the kind of insurance that countries are currently seeking by building excess reserves.  How would countries access to this new source of liquidity? The traditional approach would allocate contingent liquidity to countries according to their quota shares in the IMF. However, those are very imperfect representations of countries’ liquidity needs especially in times of crisis. Taking inspiration from the contingent capital literature, one could imagine that countries could “buy” the access to contingent liquidity in crisis times by paying, in normal times, a premium to the issuer (the IMF?). This could prove less costly than accumulating excess reserves. Going one step further, and transposing an idea from Caballero and Kurlat (2009), the IMF could issue tradable instruments giving access to contingent liquidity once it 
BIS Review 120/2010 7 has been activated. If broadly traded between public entities, the price of such instruments would give a useful indication of underlying systemic tensions in international financial markets.  Regional arrangements  Another approach would privilege regional arrangements either for pooling reserves or redistributing them though permanent swap agreements. Asian countries, especially, are working on and implementing progressively such schemes through the Chiang Mai initiative. It should be noted that regional pooling is efficient only when countries are facing asymmetric liquidity shocks within the region. Pooling brings no additional benefits when shocks occur on a global scale and all countries are hit simultaneously. Also, regional arrangements cannot avoid the moral hazard problem that all multilateral schemes are facing.  Nevertheless, there seems to be considerable scope for regional arrangements to prosper in the future. First, they can act as useful complements to more global schemes and be articulated with (and supported by) IMF facilities. Second, one can expect regional financial integration to progress, especially in those parts of the world where huge pools of savings are available and currently intermediated through financial systems located outside the region. With deeper financial integration, the probability of significant portfolio shifts inside one region increases markedly, creating the potential for asymmetric liquidity shocks. The development of regional liquidity arrangements may appear very useful to underpin the development of regional financial markets.  Stores of value  One consequence of the crisis has been to cast doubts on the ability of some assets, up to now considered as riskless, to serve as reliable stores of value. The ability of the private sector to create “safe” assets through financial innovation has proved largely illusory (Caballero, 2009). So, in the period to come there may be both an increased demand worldwide for risk free assets and much less certainty on their future supply.  The search for a liquid instrument which would also provide a reliable international store of value has been going on for many decades. When discussions were held to build the Bretton Woods system, Keynes proposed the creation of a new international currency, the “Bancor” which could serve both as a source of liquidity and a store of value. Thirty years ago, there was extensive discussion in the IMF on the creation of a substitution account. This was a mechanism through which countries could exchange their reserve currencies against SDRs, and get a protection against exchange rate risk. Most recently, Governor Zhu has reopened the debate and suggested, over the long run, the creation of a new “super reserve” currency, while, in the meantime, enhancing the role and status of the SDR.  There are good arguments to create international instruments providing a reliable store of value:   First, the safer investors feel about the risk-return profile of their holdings, the bigger the exposures they are prepared to accept. In that way, structural characteristics of the International Monetary System have an influence on the sustainability of global imbalances.   Second, once uncertainty on relative values settles in, it would likely be accompanied by extreme volatility as investors, whether public or private, constantly reshuffle their existing portfolios between countries and currencies in order to manage their exposure.   Finally, and most important, many oil and commodity producers face an intertemporal choice between extracting resources and keeping them on or under 
8 BIS Review 120/2010 the ground. According to standard economic reasoning (the Hotelling rule), one important determinant is the return earned on financial assets, to be compared to the expected commodity price increase over the long run. The possibility of large valuation losses on financial assets makes it optimal to reduce the rate of extraction, which would durably lower the supply of oil and other commodities.  However, there are also practical and conceptual difficulties:   A choice would have to be made as to the true nature of the “super reserve currency”. Would it be a basket of existing monies or a new “fiat” currency? If the “super reserve” is a basket of existing currencies (such as the SDR today) it would basically serve as an instrument for diversification of foreign exchange reserves (or private portfolios), and such a diversification can easily be achieved by using existing currencies. On the other hand, the “super sovereign” could be issued as such as a fiat currency. Then, the international community would have a basic choice. Either the new currency could be made “strong” and never depreciate against any other major existing currencies, which probably means that its supply would be severely restricted. Or, the “super sovereign” would be issued according to pre-specified rules, and depreciation against existing currencies could not be excluded. It would ensure regular supply of international liquidity, but could only provide partial protection against exchange rate volatility and valuation losses. There is an important trade off, there, which is the essence of a new “Triffin dilemma” and which cannot be avoided when looking at the public supply of international liquidity, whether by one nation or within a multilateral framework.   More fundamentally, a new currency which would provide a reliable store of value would, in fact, grant its holders a collective guarantee against exchange risk. That guarantee would benefit surplus countries and would be given by deficit countries. This issue was intensely debated when the substitution account was discussed and negotiated within the IMF, more than 25 years ago. It became clear, at the time that it would not be accepted by many countries unless some explicit, binding and symmetric rules on balance of payment adjustments were agreed upon simultaneously. Most likely, those questions would be raised again today and the creation of a new reserve currency would have to be part of a broader framework.  Conclusion and provisional policy lessons  Looking at the next decade, one can project two alternative – and polar – scenarios for the evolution of the international financial system.  First, a scenario of progressive and partial fragmentation: no significant capital account opening would occur in many parts of the world. On the contrary, new barriers could be erected either in the form of capital controls or through national regulations forcing financial institutions to ring fence local pools of capital and liquidity. There would be little convergence in domestic financial systems and regulations. Foreign exchange reserves would keep growing, both in absolute and in percentage of world GDP.  This scenario may be seen as the only realistic response to increased diversity in a multipolar world. Such an evolution could also be defended on the ground that the assumed benefits of financial harmonization and integration have not really materialized (Rodrik et al. 2008). Furthermore, the crisis has shown that no financial system can claim to be intrinsically superior and countries could feel justified in adopting and promoting their own models.  The systemic consequences, however, are not clear. In such a world, current account imbalances would be heavily influenced by public actions and policies. Regulatory competition would dominate the localization of financial activities and the allocation of savings. In the absence of some “rules of the game”, tensions would naturally arise between countries, most likely through conflicts about exchange rate regimes and policies.  
BIS Review 120/2010 9 An opposite scenario would see the progressive opening of all capital accounts, together with some (more or less intensive) convergence in financial systems and regulations. This would allow for the emergence of a unified world capital market, an efficient allocation of savings across countries and a smooth financing of current account imbalances. Such a scenario could prove attractive both for capital exporters (through better returns on excess savings) and capital importers, which may not have the option of isolating themselves from international capital markets anyway.  Experience shows, however, that an open international financial system is not inherently stable and, therefore, very dependent on a strong infrastructures and conditions. The move towards a financially open world would, at the very least, have to be supported by robust arrangements on international liquidity provision.  Pending ambitious reforms, a lot can still be done to provide investors with stable stores of value. One very promising avenue would be, for countries which have surplus savings, to develop their own internal stores of value by expanding the range of safe and liquid financial assets available to domestic and international investors. By doing so, they would achieve several goals at the same time. They would bring more efficiency in the financing of their own domestic needs. They would provide their own investors with a broader range of choices. They would also eliminate some of the currently existing incentives to export capital in order to protect its value. They would contribute to reduce the “asset shortage” with all its negative consequences, including international imbalances and the financing of asset bubbles. Financial development in many countries would address both the causes of international imbalances and some of the roots of the financial crisis.  References Adrian, T. and H. S.

BIS Review 119/2010 1 Patrick Honohan: Banks and the budget – lessons from Europe  Address by Mr Patrick Honohan, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, to the Société Universitaire Européenne de Recherches Financières (SUERF) Conference, Dublin, 20 September 2010. An earlier version of this address was presented in Beijing on 17 August 2010. *      *      * My topic today goes to the heart of the financial crisis from which we are emerging. For it is abundantly clear that a breathtaking series of banking failures have, directly or indirectly, been at the root of the budgetary problems now being faced by so many countries, and the impact of the banking crisis on national budgets is set to colour the pace, character and geographical differentiation of the economic recovery generally over the coming years.  But there are several important channels of influence between banks and the budget, some more obvious than others. Because of the scale and pervasiveness of banks, and the speed with which liquidity conditions can change, the impact of banks on the budget can be crucial. At the same time, budgetary decisions including tax and quasi-taxes crucially impact on the banks themselves as do indirect influences through the direction of credit; when banks get into trouble, they are more likely than almost any other sector to be rescued by a government whose interventions are backed up by budgetary resources.  All of this has been dramatically illustrated in recent years, months and indeed weeks. And although the epicentre of the global financial crisis was the US investment banking market, the links between banks and the budget have arguably been recently illustrated in no region more than Europe and in few European countries more than in Ireland.  Two-way channels of influence between banks and the budget – the Irish example  The channels of influence are present on the way up and the way down, and in both directions between banks and the budget.  Let me make this concrete by giving you some flavour of the Irish situation. From 2003 to 2007 the Irish banking system imported funds equivalent to over 50 per cent of GDP to fund a runaway property and construction bubble. The tax revenue generated by the boom came in many forms: capital gains on property, stamp duty on property transactions, value added tax on construction materials and income tax from the extra workers – immigrants from the rest of Europe, from Africa, from China, flooded in as the construction sector alone swelled up to account for about 13 per cent of the numbers at work (about twice the current level, which is closer to what would be normal).  For over a decade the budget was in surplus (averaging over 1½ per cent of GDP) almost every year. No need, it seemed, for restraint in spending, and so, after years of relatively disciplined government budgeting, there was a relaxation of spending controls – one I will say which was broadly welcomed across most of the political spectrum. Alas, that the apparent solidity of the public finances was all a mirage was brutally exposed when global financial confidence collapsed. Already the Irish boom was well over: house prices were falling and the government deficit widening from early 2007. The global recession did its damage to the budget also through the direct effect on world trade and accordingly on economic activity, given the very open nature of the Irish economy. But a more direct effect on the budget was yet to become manifest. The progressive tightening of short-term financial markets during the second half of 2007 and through 2008, peaking in those dramatic weeks after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, eventually exposed the fact that, not only had the banks fuelled an unsustainable property bubble, but they had not safeguarded their own solvency through adequate collateral and guarantees. The Government had little alternative 
2 BIS Review 119/2010 to announcing an extensive guarantee of bank liabilities. This has proved not to be costless, and is imposing a net cost which will place a heavy burden on taxpayers and the users of public services in Ireland for several years – though, as I have repeatedly stated since the broad magnitudes became clearer in March of this year, it is manageable from the point of view of the national public finances and a good deal less than some alarmist commentary had suggested.  To be specific, every one of the top eight retail lenders – three of them subsidiaries or branches of well-known international banking groups – have been recording loan losses which would eventually eat substantially into their capital were it not for the fact that this is in the process of being replenished. Thus the entire banking sector got caught up in an unreal scenario. Each firm was looking over its shoulder at the others and reluctant both to miss out on a seemingly profitable growth business and fearful of the shareholders’ reaction to declining market share. In an ideal world, the prudential regulator would have called a halt, but – as I have recently documented in my detailed report to the Minister for Finance on the matter – despite some misgivings about the growing exposure, the regulatory apparatus did not fully appreciate the scale and imminence of the risks whether at the systemic or individual bank level and acted only timidly and ineffectually to restrain the lending boom.  Rather than see the banks limp on, crippled by non-performing loans that would both inhibit their ability to retain depositor funding and discourage any new lending, the government already stepped in at the beginning of 2009 to begin the portfolio restructuring of the system.  The approach being adopted is comprehensive and transparent. It is designed to remove the overhang of large hard-to-recover property loans from the books of the banks, freeing their management to concentrate on providing the credit and other services needed for the economic recovery. The banks are being recapitalized – by parents in the case of the foreign-owned banks, through market-sources, backed-up by injections of capital by government where necessary for the rest.  The asset management agency NAMA has been established to purchase the largest property related loans from the banks on an ambitious scale – indeed, relative to the economy NAMA will be among the largest agencies of its type – China providing possibly the closest parallel. The NAMA approach is to buy the loans at market-related prices, with a view to NAMA breaking even or better over time as it recovers on the loans. Despite the haircuts that this inevitably entails, all five of the main locally-controlled banks have agreed to participate in NAMA. The process of valuing and transferring the loans is a painstaking one which is taking longer than everyone hoped, but it is well under way, and the discounts on the initial tranches have been large – over 50 per cent in the first two tranches on average.  Of course this crystallization of losses erodes the capital of the banks, and has given rise to a very visible and transparent recapitalization need which has been addressed very energetically by the Central Bank. (I have heard some suggestion that such up-front transparency could have been avoided by brushing the problem under the carpet in any of a variety of ways. Bank resolution history does not provide much support for such a suggestion. Denial and obfuscation would, I believe, not have been credible anyway, and would have prolonged the crisis and increased its ultimate cost.)  It has been clear to the authorities that the banks would need to be recapitalized to a comfortable and credible level if they were to recover their financial independence and operate without placing additional burdens on the budget. Well ahead of the recent EU-wide stress tests, the Central Bank conducted its own stress tests, which we called the prudential capital adequacy review (PCAR), starting with the two main banks. This entailed a detailed assessment of loan-loss prospects across the non-NAMA part of the portfolio to the end of the current loan-loss cycle, assumed to be 2012, as well as a projection of operating income. As a result of this assessment, which challenged and went further than not only the banks’ existing provisions, but their management’s projections of loan losses, the Central Bank determined for each of the banks an additional capital amount that they would have to raise, 
BIS Review 119/2010 3 one way or another. The additional amount was designed to cover not only the loan losses implied by reading across the first NAMA haircuts to the rest of the non-NAMA book, but also to ensure that the banks would have ample capital to meet the future losses. Thus, on the base case projection – which as mentioned is highly stressed relative to IFRS provisioning and relative to the banks’ own projections – the banks will come through the bottom of the cycle with at least 8 per cent core tier 1 capital (7 per cent equity).  These new capital requirements for Irish banks were announced at the end of March, to be met by the end of the year. Bank of Ireland already satisfies the requirement, having inter alia raised equity capital through a rights issue. AIB, the other large core bank in the system had more to do, and is still working on it, having announced the satisfactory sale of its Polish subsidiary within the last few days. To the extent that AIB may not raise the full amount on its own, the Government has undertaken to meet any deficiency, through the conversion of its preference share stake and if needed with an additional equity injection, presumably using the resources of the National Pension Reserve Fund.  Recapitalization and restructuring of the three smaller institutions is well under way also. Bids have been received from a number of interested parties in EBS, and I expect its future ownership to be resolved quite soon. The disposition of the retail business of Irish Nationwide will follow soon thereafter. The PCAR exercise for the bancassurer ILP has recently been completed and involves only a small additional sum to be raised.  The recapitalization process also benefits the banks’ liquidity position, both in terms of cash raised and by reducing the loan to deposit ratios.  The Government’s decision on Anglo – a bank whose astonishing level of loan losses has been widely aired, and which has damaged the domestic and international reputation of Irish banking – comes as a welcome relief. The proposed structure will provide a secure home for Anglo’s depositors, insulating them from the process of running-off the loan assets over time.  The Government has asked the Central Bank to determine the appropriate levels of capital needed in the two institutions into which Anglo is being split. There are some technicalities involved, and, while I don’t want to anticipate the exact numbers to be published, it may be worth explaining that the type of capital assessment we are doing for Anglo is different from those we have already conducted for the other Irish banks, due to the nature of the split bank structure, the goal of working out assets and of derisking the balance sheet and the prospect of a change in the regulatory status of the asset recovery entity over time. Our analysis of base capital calculations will therefore focus on the amount required to ensure the new structure is capitalized in accordance with current Basel capital requirements in light of existing provisions and immediate expected losses. We will also be publishing a stress assessment of the potential future losses taking account of stress funding costs as well. Thus, recognizing that losses may exceed the base assessment over time, by setting out a stress case we aim to provide as much certainty as is reasonably possible as to the potential exposure presented by Anglo under a severe hypothetical stress scenario in the run off of its book.  I’m not planning to revisit today details of the overall net fiscal cost of the Irish banking crisis. Everyone has known for months that the exposure is large, with a wide, though narrowing, range of uncertainty. Current work seeks to narrow the range as far as possible, though historical experience cautions against expecting great precision. The Anglo base capital and stress calculations will definitely help, and the completion of the NAMA process will also narrow the range – for example with regard to INBS.  Much of the exceptional government financial support for bank restructuring arises this year, and followers of budgetary statistics will see a sizable step jump in Irish government debt, and a sharp transient spike in government borrowing in 2010. Interested market participants are being kept well aware of this, and publication of the exact numbers should not come as a surprise. Actually, though, these exceptional financial injections into banks are smaller than the rest of the government deficit in 2009–10. Just as expansive credit conditions filled the 
4 BIS Review 119/2010 coffers in the good years, so the unwinding of an unsustainable domestic boom is draining the coffers in much the same way and to a similar magnitude.  As many of you will know, the Government has already taken prompt and painful steps to readjust its spending and tax profile, most conspicuously by effectively cutting public sector pay rates. It has kept to the targets it set for net budgetary savings in 2009 and 2010.  I have recently been looking more closely though at the multi-year prospects for the budget. Of course it can be said, if the economy stays close to the track originally envisaged, the deficit would come close to 3 per cent by 2014. But as the IMF and others have noted, the real economy, the price level and also interest rates on Government borrowing, have evolved in a less favorable way. Servicing of the additional debt related to bank restructuring is also a negative factor.  Some explicit reprogramming of the budgetary profile for the coming years is clearly necessary soon if debt dynamics are to be convincingly convergent. Recent movements in the yield spread on Government debt – both for Ireland and for some other countries – readily demonstrate the costs that can result unless international lenders remain convinced that the budget is going to be kept on a convergent path, as indeed the Government is committed to ensuring.  During the 1980s Ireland paid a high price in terms of borrowing costs because the markets feared much steeper exchange rate depreciation than actually occurred. An equilibrium of pessimism, with the economy struggling, and investors requiring a risk premium that imposed additional costs on the taxpayer, displaced what could have been an equilibrium of self-fulfilling optimism. It is important now to re-set the fiscal path to ensure a virtuous cycle of lower borrowing rates contributing to even faster fiscal adjustment and a lower overall cost of the adjustment to society at large.  While there has been an international debate on this matter for larger countries, there seems to me to be no question, for Ireland and for other small financially-stressed sovereigns, but that national growth is best served by ensuring that the public finances are convincingly on a convergent path: the impact on funding costs and confidence surely more than offsets any short-term adverse impact on domestic demand from lower net public spending.  Other recent European examples of banks imposing costs on the budget  There have been several other high profile cases in Europe – Iceland and Latvia most conspicuously – where we have seen the public finances (and the economy generally) crippled by local banking excesses that coincided with, but were not in any close way related to, the contemporary excesses related to the US mortgage market.  These two cases provide a contrast to the Irish one in regard to the impact of bank recapitalisation on the national budget. As Mervyn King has remarked, the current crisis has shown the extent to which, no matter how global banks are in life, in death – or near death experiences – they are local; in this context imposing on the national budget.  As has been thoroughly documented by the report of the inquiry there, Iceland’s banks had made a leap for scale which was not simply based on importing funds that pumped up the local economy. Indeed they greatly outgrew the local economy (which after all is very small, with a national population of less than half a million persons) and were heavily involved in the financing of international investment ventures of some of their Iceland-based customers. When these banks – middle sized in an international comparison – failed, the national authorities regarded the burden of meeting all of their liabilities as being too great to be assumed, and their rescue and restructuring of these entities was partial only, with much of the foreign liabilities not covered, a matter which led to a fraught international negotiation, especially with the authorities in the UK and Netherlands.  
BIS Review 119/2010 5 The Iceland case probes the limits of the impact that banking system rescues can have on the budget. Indeed the general issue of limiting the scope of bailouts has come under increasing international scrutiny with academics and policymakers trying to design viable ways of reducing the number of banks that can be considered too big, too complex, or too interrelated with the rest of the system, to be allowed to fail with losses to uninsured creditors. Policies designed to limit the size, remove the complexity, and pre-design an orderly liquidation scheme (living will) are all being considered as solutions in this direction. There is much to be said for this line of policy exploration; especially when it seems that some of the institutions that got into trouble globally have become too complex to be reliably managed. But I have to say that I am not altogether optimistic that there will quickly be a full solution that both preserves the effectiveness and cost efficiencies of modern finance and genuinely removes the need for rescues in all conditions.  Latvia’s reliance on foreign-owned banks points to the opposite end of the budgetary impact of financial globalization. Although there was a significant local bank failure, much of the actual and prospective loan losses in the Latvian downturn are being borne by the foreign-owned banks that made the loans (the bulk of them denominated in foreign currency, a factor which certainly complicates the assessment of risks and narrows the range of policy options).  These contrasts show the uneven degree of financial globalisation in the European Union (and the European Economic Area, which embraces Iceland). The banking system in some countries, mostly smaller countries in Central and Eastern Europe, is dominated by foreign-owned banks with headquarters elsewhere in the EEA. The direct recapitalisation costs of banking failures in those countries are exported back to the home countries, providing a kind of automatic insurance to the host country. (The primary supervisory responsibility also generally lies with the home country, though the geographical match of risk and regulation is certainly not perfect.) Most EEA countries rely principally, though, on locally-owned and controlled banks. Indeed, banks that have got into trouble and required rescuing have been shrinking back into their home countries, partly in order to help them meet regulatory capital requirements and partly because the European Commission has been taking a jaundiced view of state-aid being used to bolster geographically over-extended business models. The old vision of a seamless European banking market where, regardless of their home country within the EEA, the most cost-effective providers would deliver the financial services needed by firms and households may never have been wholly realistic, at least when it comes to retail services. But this vision has certainly suffered a setback from the Iceland case, to the extent that the regional ambitions of any bank may in practice be limited by the perceived fiscal capacity of its home government.  I have so far dwelt on the problems posed for government budgets by failing banks. The country examples I have chosen are not, of course, the only ones affected. Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom are other European countries which have seen the need for public injections of funds in one form or another. In some cases (such as Switzerland) the main source of the problem was the participation of banks in the tainted securitisations coming from the US; in other cases national bubbles were also present.  From budget to banks  But there are also pressures in the opposite direction, i.e. from budget to banks, which have only now come to the fore for the first time in advanced economies (though this was long an important dimension of the banking crises suffered by many developing countries in the 70s, 80s and 90s).  Two aspects have so far been central here, one of which relates to the pressure that a fiscally weak sovereign places on the funding costs of its home banks; the other to pressures that can be placed on banks in other jurisdictions who have or are thought to have, exposures to those sovereigns.  
6 BIS Review 119/2010 The first problem has been affecting bank lending rates across much of Europe, and is most evident in the euro area, where these effects are unrelated to currency differentials. The sharp jump in sovereign spreads in the first half of May, 2010 is only the most dramatic illustration of the degree to which these pressures matter. The tensions were transmitted immediately and fully to bank funding conditions affecting both cost and availability of wholesale funds in the relevant countries. With the European Council acting to put in place a huge commitment of public funds – some €750 billion, which is huge in relation, for example, to the outstanding stock of debt in the countries affected – as a financial back-stop mechanism to ensure access of governments to funding needs (conditional on compliance with adequate budgetary discipline – requiring quite sharp fiscal adjustment measures), the ECB stepped in promptly to purchase securities outright, with the aim of unblocking money market conditions, thereby restoring a more normal functioning of debt markets and ensuring a more effective transmission of the monetary policy stance, which has been geared for many months now to providing adequate liquidity at a low interest rate consistent with the overriding goal of low inflation.  Although market functioning improved following these actions, spreads on the debt of several sovereigns have widened again to levels that are exceptionally high by historical standards and this is still passing through to bank interest rates in the relevant countries, and adds to the cost and difficulty of rolling over wholesale deposits and debt issuance by banks in the relevant countries.  As I mentioned at the outset, Irish banks became heavily dependent on foreign funding sources at the height of the boom. It will clearly take some time for the Irish banks, like those in many other jurisdictions, to readjust their funding profile.  For example, as is well know, the Irish banks have been facing an increase in liability refinancing this month. Several policy tools have been available to assist with this process, both from the ELG guarantee scheme – which I understand will very shortly be formally confirmed as applying to 0–3 month maturities – and from central banking liquidity resources to the extent required.  The second problem has been the emergence of a market perception that significant European banks faced a serious problem with regard to cross-border holdings of sovereign debt. I believe that this issue was greatly overplayed by market participants and the recent EU-wide stress test exercise has, I think, gone a long way to putting it into a more realistic perspective, especially through the extensive disclosure of the relevant exposures.  Heightened awareness of the interaction between the budget and banks is stiffening a third form of pressure from budgetary policy to the banks. This relates to the new wave of proposals to tax banks one way or another. Given what has happened, it’s a natural impulse to see if some revenue can be clawed back from the banking system, especially in countries where most or all of the banks have now weathered the storm and are reporting healthy results. For my part, having seen and analyzed in the past some of the damaging economic distortions around the world caused by poorly designed bank taxation, explicit and implicit, I am relieved that an international consensus seems to be building around forms of taxation that are less likely to add to damaging economic distortions. Not only can many types of bank tax fall disproportionately in practice on the smaller customers of the banks rather than on the shareholders or senior managers of the banks (who are sometimes the political target of such taxes), but the potential for disintermediation to undermine the revenue can mean both a disappointing revenue and sometimes an increase in prudential risks. Fortunately, these dangers are being recognised, thus, for example, imposing a levy on uninsured liabilities of banks, or on a surrogate for the value-added of the banking system, seems more likely to have an acceptable ratio of deadweight cost to revenue, than other forms such as a tax on interest rates, or than a general tax on bank transactions as has been proposed by some, but which would in my view not generate as much revenue as is often supposed, and would not be effective in discouraging the forms of financial excess that caused the crisis. It 
BIS Review 119/2010 7 may be that well-targeted corrective Pigouvian taxes can do even better, for example if they are targeted at excessive reliance by banks and other financial firms on short-term borrowing.  Taxation is of course only one aspect of the heightened policy attention now being given to banks given their role in the crisis generally and not least in the damage they have, directly and indirectly, done to national budgets. Never more, I think, will banks be given the leeway to expand their intermediation activities with only a light regulatory touch to verify soundness. Banks must reconcile themselves to a heightened and more sceptical regulatory scrutiny, such as that which is being put in place in Ireland as in several other countries. The new capital and liquidity requirements recently agreed at Basel, and the heightened international surveillance of banking systems, exemplified by the proposed European Systemic Risk Board, represent an inevitable recognition of the interdependence of public and private finance, and the proposition that a banking license is a privilege, not a right, and one which needs to be exercised with greater regard to the public good.  
BIS Review 119/2010 1 Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: The progress made on the introduction of Islamic banking in Uganda Speech by Prof Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda, on the occasion of Eid-El-Fitri celebrations at Bank of Uganda Western Gardens, Kampala, 17 September 2010. *      *      * Your Eminence the Mufti of Uganda, The Rt. Hon. Ali Kirunda Kivejinja, Third Deputy Prime Minister/Minister of Internal Affairs,  Hon Ministers, Honorable Members of Parliament, His Worship the Mayor of Kampala, Chief Executives of Commercial Banks, Bank of Uganda Senior Management, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, Asalaam Aleikum,  Eid Mubarak, Eid Mubarak, Eid Mubarak!  It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this auspicious occasion when we mark the end of the Holy month of Ramadan and to celebrate Eid-El-Fitri.  Let me take this opportunity to congratulate our Muslim brothers and sisters for having been steadfast in committing themselves to fulfilling one of the five pillars of Islam by fasting during the Holy Month of Ramadan; I pray that Allah accepts it. I urge all the Muslims who observed the fasting to maintain this noble act of worship. The virtues of fasting should be upheld throughout your daily life both at work and elsewhere.  At the Bank of Uganda, we believe that God plays a role in everything we do in executing the Bank’s mandate “to fostering price stability and a sound financial system”. That is why we adopted the culture of starting all our meetings with a prayer led by staff from different religions and denominations to seek God’s guidance. We uphold the freedom of worship and no staff is constrained because of religious affiliation or creed and endeavor to accord equal opportunities to all. In this regard the Bank hosts the Christian Community to the Christmas thanksgiving we host the Muslims to the Eid celebrations. Let me once again assure you that the Bank is committed to hold this Eid-El-Fitri celebrations every year.  Allow me to appraise you on the progress made on the introduction of Islamic banking in Uganda which a number of local and foreign banks have expressed interest.  Ladies and gentlemen, Islamic banking is a system of banking or banking activity which is consistent with the principles of Islamic law (Shari’ah). An Islamic financial institution (IFI) is therefore one whose statute, rules and procedures expressly state its commitment to the principles of Islamic Shari’ah and to the banning of the receipt and payment of interest in any of its operations. As you are aware, the current regulatory regime does not permit financial institutions to engage in Islamic banking. To close this gap, Bank of Uganda has proposed amendments to the Financial Institutions Act, 2004 to permit the licensing of and transacting by financial institutions in Islamic banking in Uganda. The proposed amendments to the law were submitted to the Finance Minister for consideration by Cabinet and subsequently Parliament for enactment. This amendment will bring Uganda in line with other EAC member countries that have licensed Islamic banking and finance. It will increase the depth, breadth and range of finance products bank customers can use to access banking services.  
2 BIS Review 119/2010 Let me conclude by wishing you once again happy celebrations. It is now my pleasure to invite Hon Ali Kirunda Kivejinja to address the congregation.  God Bless you all.  Asalaam Aleikum,  Eid Mubarak, Eid Mubarak, Eid Mubarak 
BIS Review 118/2010 1 Lorenzo Bini Smaghi: Improving the economic governance and stability framework of the Union, in particular in the euro area Intervention by Mr Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) Committee Hearing on “Improving the economic governance and stability framework of the Union, in particular in the euro area”, Brussels, 15 September 2010. *      *      * Dear Madam Chair, Dear Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to exchange views on an issue which is both topical and highly relevant. It’s topical because in a few weeks the Commission will publish its legislative proposals and Mr Van Rompuy will present in one month the report of the Task Force to the European Council. It’s highly relevant since the recent developments have demonstrated the urgent necessity of improving the economic governance and stability framework of the Union, in particular in the euro area.  Indeed, to improve the governance and stability framework of the euro area, we need to first understand what went wrong with the previous system and the risks that may occur if these failures are not remedied. There is now broad agreement on what went wrong. The system was not able to impose the discipline which is necessary in a monetary union. In particular, the mechanisms designed to promote budgetary discipline did not work as expected. First, the decision-making process underlying the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) did not prevent excessive deficits from emerging and, when they did, it did not correct them quickly enough. Second, financial markets did not act as deterrent against the accumulation of excessive deficits, as they did not discriminate between national issuers. As a result, a combination of the global financial and economic crisis – the worse since WWII – and the accumulation of undue imbalances within the euro area, resulting from insufficient attention being paid to relative competitiveness and inappropriate fiscal policies, created a severe debt burden for several countries.  Euro area countries cannot use the monetary instrument to inflate away their debt, so the deterioration of public finances has brought to the surface a series of issues which were not fully considered at the start of EMU. The first is that countries may have problems servicing their debt. This was not thought relevant because the SGP was supposed to prevent it occurring. The second issue is that financial markets may rapidly change their assessment of a country’s solvency, and actually trigger such an event. The fact that money can be gained from the bankruptcy of a company, or even a country, without ever investing in it, raises issues related to the functioning of financial markets which unfortunately have not been tackled – it seems to me – in recent reforms.1 The third problem is that a sovereign default can have systemic consequences in a monetary union as a result of the financial interconnections. This explains why the risks affecting a relatively small part of the euro area in the course of last spring have had such significant effects on the euro.  This third dimension is still not fully understood, although it is one of the most important in view of the changes to be made to the institutional structure of the euro area. The interconnections created by the single currency have transformed what appeared to be a relatively limited problem affecting the Greek economy, which represents less than 3% of the                                                  1  L. Bini Smaghi, “Lessons of the crisis: Ethics, Markets, Democracy”, Milan, 13 May 2010  (http://www.ecb.int/press/key/date/2010/html/sp100513.en.html). 
2 BIS Review 118/2010 area GDP, into a systemic issue. This explains why, as markets started to doubt the solvency of Greece, the speculative positions aimed at minimising losses or maximising the profits associated with such an event also affected the valuation of other sovereign assets and of the euro itself. Tensions in the euro area financial markets mounted significantly in early May, reaching unusually high levels in some segments, higher even than after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Just to quote a few figures, between mid-February, right after the first European Council meeting on Greece, and Friday 7 May, the spread between the 10-year Greek and German government bonds increased by about 650 basis points. At the same time, the spreads for the Irish, Portuguese and Spanish government bonds also went up, by around 150, 230 and 90 basis points, respectively (see chart 1). Similarly, premia on credit default swaps (CDSs), a proxy for sovereign risk, also increased substantially. Interestingly, the CDS premium on German government bonds (i.e. the price to insure against their default  – whatever that means!) increased to close to 60 basis points (see chart 2). Additional evidence regarding government bond dysfunctions is reflected by the daily changes in their prices: as shown in chart 3 this measure of uncertainty peaked in May 2010. Tensions spilled over into market segments other than government bonds. Not surprisingly, the credit risk of the EU banking system mounted to levels higher than those observed after the collapse of Lehman Brothers (see chart 4). By the same token, the probability of a simultaneous default of two or more large and complex euro area banking groups, as measured by the indicator of systemic risk reported in chart 5, rose sharply on 7 May. Money market volatility also surged (see chart 6): implied volatility on three-month interest rate futures went up in early May for contracts expiring six months (second contract) and 12 months (fourth contract) ahead. Regarding the foreign exchange markets, between mid-February and 7 May, the euro depreciated by 7% against the dollar, from USD 1.36 to 1.27 per euro. Shorting the euro became the proxy speculative position for selling Greek and other “peripheral” debt. In early May the net short speculative (non-commercial) position against the euro reached a record 114,000 contracts, equivalent to about €14 billion (see chart 7). The turmoil had an impact on equity markets as well: between mid-February and 7 May, the euro area stock market declined by more than 7% (and by 15.5% from April 15 to May 7!). Even more worrisome, in May equity indices decreased worldwide (see chart 8). In May and June the average pair-wise realised correlation between S&P500 stocks went up more than it did after the Lehman bankruptcy. Loosely speaking, this indicates that concerns about macroeconomic developments had inhibited investors from differentiating between different stocks, and panic was mounting (see chart 9). Stock markets also became more volatile, as reflected by the increase in the implied volatility of the EuroStoxx50 and S&P500 indices, albeit at levels lower than those observed towards the end of 2008 (see chart 10). The long-term implied volatility of the US stock market also surged (see chart 11). Finally, indicators of investors’ sentiment, as measured by the difference between equity put and call options implied volatilities, went up in May (see charts 12, 13, and 14). All in all, on the eve of the first week-end of May the global financial system was on the verge of a meltdown similar to, if not worse than, the one which occurred after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Markets would indeed have collapsed if the Heads of State and Government of the euro area had not agreed – that weekend – to establish a European Financial Stability Fund to support countries in difficulty and if the ECB had not decided to intervene directly in some securities markets to restore their proper functioning. That action stopped the speculative rout and forced market participants that had taken short positions against the euro and some sovereign assets to bear losses. The actions succeeded in preserving the integrity of the euro area. 
BIS Review 118/2010 3 It would be a mistake to think that the risks which emerged last spring will never occur again. Unless the weaknesses that were exposed during the spring are definitely addressed, new bouts of instability may arise. The Van Rompuy task force has the mandate to produce concrete proposals. Those proposals must close all the loopholes in the institutional construction of the euro, which could leave it exposed to future attacks. This is the real challenge we are confronted with. Any change in the institutional structure of the euro should start by avoiding the same simplifying assumptions made in the past. Let me mention three.  The first is to think that markets are always right and are able to discipline countries and their debts. Markets made mistakes in the past in under-pricing risk, they are probably doing so again now in over-pricing it, and they will also make mistakes in the future. Leaving to markets the task of disciplining budgetary policies and inducing the Member States to take corrective actions is an illusion that only economists can have. If we really want to prevent and correct imbalances, in particular fiscal imbalances, we need stronger institutional mechanisms, across the euro area and within countries. This means more rules and automatic sanctions.  The second mistake is to think that crises can be prevented altogether. Crises have occurred in the past and might occur in the future, also because of contagion. We have to be prepared for them and be able to manage them efficiently.  The third mistake is to think that there are easy, or “orderly” solutions to crises. Crises are messy, contagious and have unintended consequences. The ECB has developed concrete proposals to address the above issues. They are now well known, so let me be concise and point to the three main aspects, which relate to fiscal discipline, macroeconomic surveillance and crisis management. Let me start with two general, but important points. The first is that these proposals do not change the fundamental nature of the euro area, in particular with respect to the basic allocation of responsibilities in relation to budgetary policy, which remains in the hands of the national authorities. There is no need to have a single budgetary policy in the euro area. No need for a so-called transfer union. However, national budgetary policies have to be conducted in a framework which is consistent with a single currency. We need a leap forward in the governance underlying the economic policies conducted in the member states of the euro area. We should therefore concentrate our efforts on strengthening discipline first and foremost in euro area countries since they share the common currency, making use of the provisions of the Treaty – notably Article 136 – which has been inserted into the Treaty precisely because the member countries of monetary union require enhanced economic governance. Whatever is decided for the euro area could conceivably also apply to the rest of the Union, but the discussion among all 27 Member States should not water down what is necessary for the euro area. The second point is that the institutional framework can be strengthened within the current Treaty, exploiting to the extent possible secondary legislation. There is no need for a Treaty change to achieve the large part of proposals which are required and that we have put forward. There is also no time. As I mentioned previously, the doubts raised by financial markets about the ability of the system to become more resilient need to be answered quickly. If these answers are linked to a long and uncertain ratification process, doubts will spread again.  Let me now turn to the discussions which have taken place so far on the three main building blocs of the reform.  On the subject of reinforced fiscal governance, a first step forward was made on 7 September, when the ECOFIN Council endorsed the new framework of the EU Semester as had been proposed by the Commission in its Communication of 12 May. Better fiscal governance requires changes both at the national and European level. At the national level, 
4 BIS Review 118/2010 the ECB supports the establishment of national fiscal frameworks that set out minimum requirements for compliance with EU fiscal and statistical rules and that in particular would promote more independence in the national fiscal assessment, high-quality standards, a medium-term orientation and an effective coverage of all general government finances. At the EU level, the ECB favours a strengthening of the fiscal framework around the five following measures: 1. more streamlined and hence more effective procedures in the assessment of fiscal developments;  2. reversal of the burden of proof, making it more difficult for the Council to overturn in its decisions the assessment of the Commission.  3. more independence in the collection, verification and assessment of the fiscal data and fiscal analysis at the level of the Commission.  4. more emphasis on public debt developments, as the Treaty foresees.  5. quasi-automaticity of sanctions in case of breaches of the rules, including the provision of both so-called procedural and financial sanctions. The Commission’s Communications of 12 May and 30 June does not go far enough in the ECB’s view on two counts: 1. They thus far remain silent on how the independence of the fiscal assessment and the independence and quality assessment of the statistical data collection can be made more effective within the Commission. In particular, we would like to see some of the procedures currently in force in DG Competition at the level of the technical assessment and the role of the Commissioner in the college also being applied for DG ECFIN and its Commissioner. As regards statistics, the new Council Regulation of July 2010 should be followed up with deeds; in particular with more resources devoted to fiscal data and its verification by Eurostat.  2. The Commission ideas currently on the table provide too little in terms of streamlining the procedures and hence making them more effective. We have seen many times in the past that procedures are too lengthy and laborious before effective action can be undertaken to incentivise or enforce on Member States a correction in their fiscal developments. So far, procedures have been launched only on the basis of the notification by the Member States. It could be envisaged to also launch them on the basis of an assessment or a forward looking assessment by the Commission. Had this been done in the case of Greece, many problems could have been avoided or at least reduced. On the second building block – broader macroeconomic surveillance – we see a strong need for making a quantum leap, given the large spillovers from the macroeconomic policies of one country on all other participating countries in the single currency area. Accordingly, the ECB proposes the creation of an alert mechanism based on a clear and limited set of indicators that identifies unsustainable policies at a sufficiently early stage. We would also like to see put in place a procedure for the correction of macroeconomic imbalances with a preventive and a corrective arm which includes graduated enforcement steps to ensure compliance, including sanctions. Again, the Commission ideas voiced in its communication of 30 June go in the right direction but are not yet ambitious enough to meet the long-term requirements of an efficiently functioning monetary union. We are awaiting for the new proposals in this field and stand ready to contribute actively. Let me now spend a few words on the third building block, crisis management. There is a theory according to which if you have a good prevention system there will be no crisis. It is a theory, indeed. In practice, crises do occur, even though the institutional system underlying surveillance and prevention should be strengthened to avoid such crises. As I mentioned earlier, it would not only be a mistake but also irresponsible to assume that crises will never 
BIS Review 118/2010 5 occur again. This would encourage market participants to speculate on their re-occurrence because of a lack of proper management framework. As we have experienced, self-fulfilling expectations could by themselves precipitate a crisis. The creation of the EFSF ultimately averted the financial collapse in early May. Without such a system the euro would be vulnerable to any speculative attack against any of its members, be it justified or not by economic fundamentals.2 The question is how to create a management mechanism that avoids crises without creating moral hazard. This is not a new issue. It has been dealt with in the context of the IMF and consists of attaching strong conditions, in terms of structural and fiscal policies, to any financial support that is provided to a country in difficulty. Financial support is disbursed only according to precise milestones, linked to compliance with the conditions contained in the programme. There is no need for Europe to reinvent the wheel. We can learn from the experience of the IMF. History shows that countries are not particularly keen to get financial support from the IMF, precisely because of its tough conditions. The proposals put forward by the ECB go very much in that direction and aim to create a framework that can manage a crisis effectively while discouraging speculative attacks against the system. The crisis management framework raises another issue, which is more complex and deserves some reflection. The issue is known as “private sector involvement” in crisis resolution. What it means is that public money should not be used to bail out private sector organisations that have taken the wrong decisions. This would be the case if the money provided by the crisis management framework were used to reimburse the private sector for its losses, eliminating all the risks it was exposed to.  This issue was considered in the context of the IMF reform after the Asian crisis. The discussion showed that it is very difficult to design a simple mechanism which would make restructuring mandatory. The reason is simple. The solvency of a state is a different concept from that of a company or a financial institution. It ultimately depends on the economic and political sustainability of achieving and sustaining a given level of primary budget surplus to stabilise and reduce the debt. If a country commits to a certain recovery programme which justifies the financial support of the other partners, it cannot be considered insolvent and unable to reimburse its debts. Why should it in such cases restructure them? On the other hand, if debt restructuring is made too easy, or too “orderly” – to use a fashionable term – market participants may consider it the easy way out for countries and might be tempted to take speculative positions from which they would profit in case of default. In other words, a restructuring mechanism, if too simple, could lead to moral hazard. Furthermore, the very nature of the markets would mean contagion spreading immediately to the other countries, as participants would start guessing which other country might need to undergo restructuring.  To sum up, using the words of a recent IMF document, in today’s advanced economies default is UUU, “Unnecessary, Undesirable and Unlikely”.3 It is naïve to think that there is such a thing as an orderly debt restructuring mechanism. What is the solution then, if we want to avoid moral hazard and unduly bailing out the private sector? The best way to involve the private sector is to ensure that a country which experiences financial difficulties implements a credible adjustment programme, which convinces markets to invest again in that country. Experience shows that successful programmes – with “success” being measured by the policies which have been                                                   2  “An Economist Reflects: A View from 2020: The Eurozone Break-up of 2013” Morgan Stanley Research Europe, 30 July 2010. 3  Cottarelli, Forni, Gottschalk and Mauro, “Default in Today’s Advanced Economies: Unnecessary, Undesirable, and Unlikely”, IMF Staff Position Note 10/12, 1 September 2010. 
6 BIS Review 118/2010 implemented – have ultimately made it possible to regain market confidence. It may take some time, and some re-profiling of official financial support, but in the end access to markets was regained.  If some form of rescheduling or re-profiling of the debt over time turns out to be necessary, for the debt to be sustainable, this can be achieved in an orderly way only through an agreement between creditors and debtors. Other forms of constrained action, on the creditor or on the debtor side, are bound to lead to litigations and produce disorderly effects on financial markets. In this respect, the adoption of collective action clauses by the euro area member states would make it easier for creditors and debtors to agree on a fair burden-sharing. This was the conclusion of the discussions in the context of the IMF and can be further explored at European level.  Another way to prevent market participants from being bailed out is to use the funds made available from the official support mechanism to purchase debt on the secondary market, at the prevailing market discount, rather than reimbursing the maturing debt at the nominal value. In this way holders of debt instruments willing to sell would have to accept the market haircut. This possibility is envisaged in the ECB’s proposals. To conclude, the European Union is a community of law, subscribed to by the Member States in which pacta sunt servanda. This refers to all the pacts, starting from fiscal discipline in the member states to the commitment of the Member States to pay their debts. In my view, we have to be very careful in considering exemptions, such as providing the possibility for countries to unilaterally modifying the value of their debt contracts. The euro, and its underlying institutional construction, is about respect for the law. If any changes are to be made, they should be to strengthen these principles rather than to provide exemptions – dangerous exemptions which could undermine the stability and cohesion of the whole Union.  Thank you for your attention.

BIS Review 118/2010 1 Lars E O Svensson: Monetary policy after the financial crisis Speech by Mr Lars E O Svensson, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Second International Journal of Central Banking (IJCB) Fall Conference, Tokyo, 17 September 2010. *      *      * I thank Claes Berg, Marianne Nessén, Staffan Viotti and Barbro Wickman-Parak for comments on this speech. The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Riks-bank’s Executive Board or of the Riksbank’s staff. Gabriela Guibourg of the Riksbank’s staff has contrib-uted to this speech. As the world economy recovers from the recent financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed, a debate is going on regarding the causes behind the crisis and how to reduce the risk of future crises. The role of monetary policy and its relation to financial stability are also under debate and some argue that there is a need to modify the framework of flexible inflation targeting and give a greater role to financial-stability considerations. Some blame too expansionary monetary policy by the Federal Reserve after 2001 for laying the foundation for the crisis.  My view is that the crisis was largely caused by factors that had very little to do with monetary policy. And my main conclusion for monetary policy is that flexible inflation targeting – applied in the right way and in particular using all the information about financial conditions that is relevant for the forecast of inflation and resource utilisation at any horizon – remains the best-practice monetary policy before, during, and after the financial crisis.  A related conclusion is that neither price stability nor interest-rate policy is sufficient to achieve financial stability. A separate financial-stability policy is needed. In particular, monetary policy and financial-stability policy need to be conceptually distinguished, since they have different objectives and different appropriate instruments, even when central banks have responsibility for both1.  So today, I will first briefly summaries my view of the causes of the crisis, and then discuss what the possible lessons are for future monetary policy, and finally I shall emphasise the distinction between monetary policy and financial-stability policy.  The financial crisis had little to do with monetary policy  As I see it, the financial crisis was caused by factors that had very little to do with monetary policy. The factors were the macro conditions; distorted incentives in financial markets; regulatory and supervisory failures; information problems; and some very specific circumstances, such as the US housing policy to support home ownership for low-income households2.  Regarding the macro conditions, global imbalances with large saving relative to investment in many emerging-market economies, and corresponding low saving relative to investments in industrialised countries – the so called global saving glut and investment shortage – lead to low real interest rates and high asset prices (Bernanke 2007). Low world real interest rates in combination with the Great Moderation, the long period of very stable growth and stable low inflation, led to a systematic underestimation of risk, very low risk premia in financial markets, and a large expansion of credit.                                                   1  For a more detailed discussion of these issues, see Svensson (2010, section 5.2). 2  See Bean (2009) for more discussion. 
2 BIS Review 118/2010 Distorted incentives for commercial and investment banks to increase leverage to excessive levels, together with lax regulation and supervision and the lack of an appropriate bank resolution regime, lead to a very fragile financial sector. Securitisation reduced the incentives to exercise due diligence in loan origination. It also led to regulatory arbitrage by setting up off-balance-sheet entities, which for various reasons nevertheless remained in effect on the balance sheet. Traders and fund managers also had distorted incentives to take excessive risks because of short-sighted and asymmetric remuneration contracts.  There were eventually enormous information problems in assessing the risks of extremely complex asset-backed securities, and the potential for correlated systemic risks was grossly underestimated. None of these causes had anything to do with monetary policy, except indirectly in that monetary policy may have contributed to the Great Moderation.  Regarding the role of the Federal Reserve’s expansionary monetary policy in the period preceding the crisis, opinion is divided as to whether or not it contributed to the build-up of the crisis. In my view, during the period in question there was a genuine and well-motivated fear of the United States falling into a Japanese-style deflationary liquidity trap, and the optimal policy in such a situation is a very expansionary monetary policy3. Given the empirically limited effect of policy rates on house prices, a very tight US monetary policy would have been required to prevent the house price boom, with a deep recession and the risk of the US falling into deflation and a liquidity trap4. And a tighter monetary policy would have had no impact on the global imbalances, regulatory problems, distorted incentives and information problems mentioned above (although it could have ended the Great Moderation with a deep recession and deflation).  Lessons for monetary policy  What conclusions can we draw so far from the financial crisis about the conduct of monetary policy and any need to modify the framework of flexible inflation targeting? One obvious conclusion is that price stability is not enough to achieve financial stability (Carney 2009, White 2006). Good flexible inflation targeting by itself does not achieve financial stability, if anyone ever thought it did. Specific policies and instruments are needed to ensure financial stability.  Another conclusion is that interest-rate policy is not enough to achieve financial stability. The policy rate is an ineffective instrument for influencing financial stability, and policy rates high enough to have a noticeable effect on credit growth and house prices will have a strong negative effect on inflation and resource utilisation, even in sectors that are not experiencing any speculative activity. The use of the policy rate to prevent an unsustainable boom in house prices and credit growth poses major problems for the timely identification of such an unsustainable development, as well as for the assessment of whether policy-rate adjustment would have any noticeable impact on the development, and of whether, in the longer run, the development of inflation and resource utilisation would be better (Bean et al. 2010, Kohn 2008, 2009).  Other instruments like supervision and regulation, including appropriate bank resolution regimes, should be the first choice for financial stability. Preventing a financial crisis requires not only improvements in the supervision of financial institutions, but also a greater emphasis on the supervision of the financial system as a whole. As regards the regulatory framework, generally, to the extent that financial instability depends on specific distortions, good regulation should aim to attack these distortions as close to the source as possible.

BIS Review 118/2010 3 prudential regulation that is contingent on the business cycle and financial indicators may need to be introduced to induce better financial stability. Possible macro-prudential regulation includes variable capital, margin, and equity/loan requirements.  However, one important lesson from the financial crisis is that financial conditions may have a very strong and deteriorating effect on the transmission mechanism, making standard interest-rate policy much less effective. This motivates more research on how to incorporate financial conditions and financial intermediation into the standard models of the transmission mechanism used by central banks. Much progress has already been made in understanding these effects (see Adrian and Shin 2010, Gertler and Kiyotaki 2010 and Woodford 2010a). However, even with much better analytical foundations concerning the role of financial conditions in the transmission mechanism, there will of course, as always, be considerable scope for the application of good judgment in monetary policy.  What about “leaning against the wind”, the idea that central banks should raise the interest rate more than what appears to be warranted by inflation and resource utilisation to counter rapid credit growth and rising asset prices? It has sometimes not been entirely clear to me whether advocates of the leaning against the wind policy mean that credit growth and asset prices should be considered targets and entered into the explicit or implicit loss functions alongside inflation and resource utilisation. Or whether they mean that credit growth and asset prices should still be considered just indicators, and that they emphasise them merely because credit growth and asset prices may have potential negative effects on inflation and resource utilisation at a longer horizon.  In the latter case, leaning against the wind is a way to improve the stability of inflation and resource utilisation in the longer run. Then it is completely consistent with my interpretation of flexible inflation targeting.  More precisely, flexible inflation targeting aims at stabilising inflation around the inflation target and resource utilisation around a normal level. Monetary policy then boils down to “forecast targeting”, choosing a policy-rate path such that the corresponding forecasts of inflation and resource utilisation best stabilise inflation around the target and the resource utilisation around a normal level. If the central bank uses all relevant information in constructing these forecasts, including the impact of changes in financial conditions on inflation and resource utilisation at any horizon, monetary policy will automatically respond in the best possible way to changing financial conditions (Woodford 2007, 2010a). Taking financial conditions into account becomes a special case of the general rule of “filtering all information through the forecast”. Only information that affects the forecast should be responded to, whereas information that does not affect the forecast can be disregarded.  However, suppose that, for some reason, the appropriate and effective instruments to ensure financial stability are not available, for instance, because of serious problems with the regulatory and supervisory framework that cannot be remedied in the short run. In such a second-best situation, if there is a threat to financial stability, one may argue that, to the extent that policy rates do have an impact on financial stability, that impact should be taken into consideration when choosing the policy-rate path to best stabilise inflation and resource utilisation. Such considerations could result in a lower or higher policy-rate path than otherwise, in order to trade off less effective stabilisation of inflation and resource utilisation for more financial stability5. However, so far all of the evidence indicates that in normal times                                                  5  Such considerations could include evidence of the “risk-taking channel” as in Borio and Zhu (2008). Adrian and Shin (forthcoming) and Adrian and Shin (2010) argue, in a model with such a risk-taking channel, that short interest-rate movements may have considerable effects on the leverage of securities broker-dealers in the market-based financial sector outside the commercial-banking sector. If we assume that the risk of a financial crisis increases as this leverage increases, and that policy rates affect leverage, then policy rates would affect the risk of a financial crisis (Woodford 2010b). However, new regulation is likely to limit excess leverage and limit the magnitude of these affects. The size of the market-based financial sector may end up 
4 BIS Review 118/2010 that trade-off is very unfavourable, in the sense that the impact of policy rates on financial stability is quite small and the impact on inflation and resource utilisation is significantly larger, so an optimal trade-off would still have little impact on financial stability. A good financial-stability policy framework is necessary to ensure financial stability. Monetary policy cannot serve as a substitute.  The relation between monetary policy and financial-stability policy  In general, it is helpful to conceptually distinguish financial-stability policy from monetary policy. Different economic policies and policy areas, such as fiscal policy, monetary policy, labour market policy, etc., can be distinguished according to their objectives, the policy instruments that are suitable for achieving the objectives, and the authority or authorities controlling the instruments and responsible for achieving the objectives. From this point of view, it is clear that monetary policy and financial-stability policy are very different, and understanding this distinction is important.  Monetary policy, in the form of flexible inflation targeting, has the objective of stabilising inflation around the inflation target as well as resource utilisation around a normal level. Under normal circumstances, the suitable instruments are the policy rate and communication. In times of crisis, as we have seen during the current crisis, other more unconventional methods can be used, such as fixed-rate lending at longer maturities and asset purchases (quantity easing) to affect longer interest rates and expectations of future short rates, and foreign-exchange intervention to prevent currency appreciation or even to induce currency depreciation. The authority responsible for monetary policy is typically the central bank.  Financial-stability policy has the objective of maintaining and promoting financial stability. Financial stability can be defined as a situation where the financial system can fulfil its main functions of submitting payments, channelling saving into investment, and providing risk sharing without disturbances that have significant costs. The available instruments are, under normal circumstances, supervision, regulation, and financial-stability reports with analyses and leading indicators that may provide early warnings of stability threats. In times of crisis, authorities may use such instruments as lending of last resort, variable-rate lending at longer maturities (credit policy, credit easing), special resolution regimes for financial firms in trouble, government lending guarantees, government capital injections, and so forth. The responsible authority or authorities vary across countries. In some countries it is the central bank, in other countries there is a separate financial supervisory authority, and sometimes the authority is shared between different institutions.  Financial-stability policy and monetary policy are conceptually distinct, with distinct objectives and distinct suitable instruments. My point here is that this has to be taken into account when considering the lessons of the financial crisis for monetary policy. The interest rate is a blunt and unsuitable instrument for achieving financial stability and it thus makes little sense to assign the objective of financial stability to monetary policy. However, it may make sense to assign the objective of financial stability to the central bank, if the central bank is given control of the appropriate supervisory and regulatory instruments.  The fact that financial-stability policy and monetary policy are different does not mean that there is no interaction between them. Similarly, monetary policy and fiscal policy are distinct policies but both have an impact on inflation and resource utilisation. The interaction between monetary policy and financial-stability policy has to be considered. Monetary policy affects asset prices and balance sheets and can thereby affect financial stability. Financial-stability                                                                                                                                                       being smaller after the crisis. In Europe, Canada and the Nordic countries, commercial banks dominate the financial sector. 
BIS Review 118/2010 5 policy directly affects financial conditions, which affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. This motivates more research on how to incorporate financial conditions into the standard models of the transmission mechanism used by central banks. The outcome might very well be that financial conditions are considered to play a larger role in the transmission mechanism and as indicators of future inflation and resource utilisation. If so, central banks would end up responding more to financial indicators, in the sense of adjusting the policy rate and policy-rate path more to a given change in a financial indicator. But this would not mean that financial conditions and indicators would become independent targets for monetary policy. Conclusions  My main conclusion from the crisis with regard to monetary policy so far is that flexible inflation targeting – applied in the right way and using all the information about financial conditions that is relevant for the forecast of inflation and resource utilisation at any horizon – remains the best-practice monetary policy before, during, and after the financial crisis. But a better theoretical, empirical and operational understanding of the role of financial conditions and financial intermediation in the transmission mechanism is urgently required and needs much work, work that is already underway in academia and in central banks. Furthermore, monetary policy cannot guarantee financial stability. A separate financial-stability policy, with the objective of financial stability and with suitable instruments other than the policy rate, is required.

BIS Review 118/2010 1 Masaaki Shirakawa: Uniqueness or similarity? Japan’s post-bubble experience in monetary policy studies  Keynote address by Mr Masaaki Shirakawa, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Second International Journal of Central Banking (IJCB) Fall Conference, Tokyo, 16 September 2010. *      *      * I.  Introduction I am very pleased to have a chance today to address the IJCB Conference. In particular, this conference is very timely and appropriate in two aspects. First, as everybody here is well aware, this conference focuses on a very important theme for central bank policymakers in the current situation, “Monetary Policy Lessons from the Global Crisis.” Second, whether intentionally or not, this conference is held in Japan, the country often quoted as a precedent on that theme.1 In fact, we hear heated discussions in the United State as to whether the United States will fall into “deflation in the Japanese style” or the “lost decade like Japan” (Chart 1).2 The line of discussions generally has something in common in interpreting Japan’s experience. That is, a weak economic performance is attributed mainly to the failures of Japan’s policy authorities or the factors peculiar to the Japanese economy and society. I cannot completely deny Japan’s uniqueness, but I should also emphasize that we can find a lot of similarities between Japan’s experience and our experience in the recent global financial crisis. At various international conferences I attended in the early 2000s, I explained the Japanese situation many times, but never imagined that zero interest rates and quantitative easing would be adopted by other central banks in the advanced economies. I believe many of central bank officials thought the same way. In short, Japan’s experience provides too important and general food for thought to say that Japan is just unique. Nevertheless, I have the impression that Japan’s experience is often discussed, based on casual reading of related facts. Taking this opportunity, I will articulate my thoughts on how to make use of Japan’s experience since the burst of a bubble in making monetary policy studies.3 II.  Seven facts on Japan’s economy since the burst of a bubble The Japanese economy after the burst of a bubble is often referred to as the “lost decade.”4 Real GDP growth remained just 1.5 percent on average in the 1990s, which declined significantly from 4.6 percent in the 1970s and 4.4 percent in the 1980s (Chart 2).5 CPI inflation reached its peak of 3.3 percent in January 1991 soon after the burst of a bubble, started declining shortly thereafter, and turned negative in 1998 (Chart 1, shown earlier). Looking at policy responses, on the monetary policy front, the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ’s) first policy rate reduction after the burst of a bubble was carried out in July 1991, one year after                                                  1  See, for example, Ahearne et al. (2002), Krugman (1998), and Posen (1998). 2  See, for example, Bullard (2010) and Rogoff (2010). 3  In my speech today, I focus on Japan’s experience after the burst of a bubble. See also Okina, Shirakawa, and Shiratsuka (2001) for discussions on the cause of the bubble since the late 1980s and its lessons for monetary policy. 4  With regard to the appropriateness of the phrase, “lost decade,” see Shirakawa (2009). 5  In the 2000s, the average growth rate recovered slightly, and stayed at 1.7 percent until 2007 before the collapse of Lehman Brothers. 
2 BIS Review 118/2010 the peak of land prices (Chart 3).6 Overnight interest rates came down to 0.5 percent and virtually reached zero interest rates in 1995, four years after the BOJ started the policy rate reductions.7 On the fiscal policy front, aggressive stimulus measures were taken in two periods: soon after the burst of a bubble and from 1998 to 1999 (Chart 4). After the introduction of the quantitative easing policy, the contributions of fiscal expenditure to real GDP growth remained negative. On the financial system policy front, capital injections into undercapitalized financial institutions started in 1998. The amount of injected public funds relative to nominal GDP finally reached 2.5 percent in Japan. Compared to the United States in the recent crisis, the amount of injected public funds was smaller in the United States, and remained 1.5 percent of nominal GDP, but the capital injections were carried out much faster in the United States. Those are the quick summary of macroeconomic conditions and policy responses after the burst of a bubble in Japan. When making use of Japan’s experience in monetary policy studies, I want to draw your attention to the following facts. First, Japan experienced business cycle expansions and contractions three times each since the low-growth 1990s (Chart 5).8 That seems contrary to the impression from the phrase of the “lost decade” that Japan has remained stagnant all the time since the 1990s. Whenever some signs of recovery were observed in Japan, expectations that the economy would finally escape from stagnant conditions and enter a full-fledged recovery were rising. Based on such Japan’s experience, I attempted to draw public attention to the risk of falling into false optimism by using the phrase of a “false dawn,” when we saw some signs of economic recovery in advanced economies in the spring of 2009.9 Second, Japan did not experience a sharp and drastic economic contraction on the scale that we experienced after the failure of Lehman Brothers. Looking at Japan’s real GDP trend, the largest decline was recorded in the first quarter of 1998 by −1.9 percent. That decline, however, was smaller than those in many countries, including Japan, after the failure of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 (Chart 6). Even during the period from 1997 to 1998, when Japan’s financial crisis was severest, the level of real GDP remained higher than the average level of 1989, when Japan was at the peak of the bubble period. Third, Japan showed economic growth on a per worker basis comparable to the United States in the 2000s, although significantly declined from the 1980s (Chart 7). At the same time, Japan delivered a weaker performance in real GDP growth. Obviously, the differences between real GDP growth and real GDP growth per worker reflect the declines in the workforce in Japan.10 In any event, in analyzing the Japanese economy after the burst of a bubble, it is essential to take account of changes in potential growth, which is determined by productivity growth and demographic changes. Fourth, Japan has experienced deflation, but its severity has been contained at a mild level. Consumer price inflation turned negative in 1998, and from 1997 to 2010 it declined by −3.3 percent on a cumulative basis, and −0.3 percent on an annualized basis (Chart 8).11 In                                                  6  The intervals between the peak of land/housing prices and the first policy rate reduction are almost the same in Japan and the United States. 7  Okina and Shiratsuka (2002) make an assessment on the BOJ’s monetary policy actions before and after the burst of a bubble based on the Taylor rule. 8  In Japan, the President of the Economic and Social Research Institute, Cabinet Office, decides on the reference dates of business cycles, based on the discussions in the Investigation Committee for Business Cycle. 9  See Shirakawa (2009). 10  That tendency becomes more evident, by comparing real GDP growth per man-hour. See Hayashi and Prescott (2002). 11  The latest figure for the Japanese CPI is July 2010. 
BIS Review 118/2010 3 the meantime, long-term inflation expectations remained generally unchanged, and anchored around 1 percent (Chart 9). Japan’s deflation since the second half of the 1990s is a rare experience in the post-war advanced economies, but the scale of the price decline is far smaller, compared to the period of the Great Depression when the United States registered a CPI decline of 24 percent in the 1930s (Chart 10). Fifth, Japan has experienced deflation not only in goods prices but also in services prices. Compared with the United States, the difference in consumer price inflation is mainly attributed to services prices (Chart 11). That reflected flexible adjustments in nominal wages in Japan, since the service sector is basically labor-intensive. Sixth, Japan has not experienced a deflationary spiral. More precisely, Japan has not experienced the phenomenon after the burst of a bubble that a decline in prices induces a decline in economic activity, thereby leading to a further decline in prices.12 Instead, Japan has experienced the longest recovery, just in duration without considering its strength, from 2002 under mild deflation (Chart 12). Seventh and finally, the BOJ introduced various innovative policy measures (Chart 13).13 The zero interest rate policy was first introduced by the BOJ in 1999. The “quantitative easing policy,” which set a target for money market operations on the outstanding amount of current account balances at the central bank and expanded such balances far above the required reserve levels, was also first introduced by the BOJ in 2001. The BOJ expanded its balance sheet size considerably. From 1995 when overnight interest rates fell down to virtually zero, the ratio of the BOJ’s balance sheet size to nominal GDP increased by more than 20 percentage points at its peak (Chart 14). That increase in the ratio for the BOJ is twice as large as that in the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of England (BOE) in the recent crisis. In addition, the level of the ratio for the BOJ is still higher than that for the Fed, the ECB, and the BOE. As the target level of the current account balances was raised, the maturities of short-term funds-supplying operations became lengthened. In the final stage of the quantitative easing policy, the average maturities exceeded six months, and the longest one reached eleven months. In addition, an experimental policy measure of commitment to the future course of monetary policy was first introduced by the BOJ. Under the quantitative easing policy, for example, the BOJ made a commitment to continuing with the quantitative easing policy “until core CPI inflation becomes stably zero or above.” The BOJ also adopted “credit easing” in the current terminology. The assets purchased included asset-backed securities (ABSs) and asset-backed commercial papers (ABCPs). The BOJ purchased stocks held by financial institutions to reduce market risk associated with stockholdings, which was one of the biggest risk factors in potentially destabilizing the financial system. As I have reviewed so far, the BOJ introduced various unprecedented measures under the uncharted circumstances during the period from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. Innovative aspects of such policy measures were not well recognized at that time, but, in retrospect, such measures involved most of the elements in the unconventional policy measures taken in the recent global financial crisis.                                                  12  For example, Posen (2010) noted that Japanese deflation remained stable over the course of the 1990s rather than accelerated. 13  For the overview of empirical studies on the effects of the BOJ’s monetary policy measures in the 2000s, including the quantitative easing policy, see Ugai (2007). 
4 BIS Review 118/2010 III.  Four similarities in economic conditions and policy responses after the burst of a bubble Based on the facts in Japan’s experience after the burst of a bubble, I will next point out four observations that are common to economic conditions and policy responses after the burst of a bubble in the two cases: one is the U.S. and European economies in the recent crisis and the other is the Japanese economy since the 1990s. I will also elaborate on their implications in analyzing economic conditions and monetary policy after the burst of a bubble. Sluggish economic recovery and balance-sheet adjustment The first similarity concerns the fact that it took fairly long before restoring the full-fledged recovery path after the burst of a bubble.14 In Japan, it was 2003 when the economy went back to the steady recovery path, and it thus took more than ten years since the burst of a bubble. In the U.S. and European economies, the adjustment is still continuing, and the duration of the adjustment period is yet to be confirmed. However, we can safely say that it will take some time before restoring the full-fledged recovery path. That is because the balance-sheet adjustment produces significant downward pressure on the economy in the process of resolving various “excesses” accumulated during a bubble period.15 The forms of “excesses” vary from country to country. In Japan, they were “three excesses” in the business sector: employment, production capacity, and debt (Chart 15).16 It is essential to explicitly incorporate an adjustment mechanism of “excesses” in analyzing the economy after the burst of a bubble. As a related issue, before the crisis it was frequently argued that a financial system with well-developed capital markets, in addition to a sturdy banking system, was more robust to a shock than a bank-centric financial system, since both the bank channel and the capital market channel worked in a complementary manner.17 It seems, however, such a view needs to be reconsidered. Effects of dysfunctional interbank money markets The second similarity lies in the fact that the sharp contraction of economic activity after the burst of a bubble occurred when interbank money markets became destabilized. In Japan, as I mentioned earlier, it was the period from 1997 to 1998 when real GDP declined the most, and it was the fall of 1997 when interbank money markets became destabilized (Chart 16).18 In the recent global financial crisis, real GDP in advanced economies, including the United States and European countries, registered the largest decline during the period from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. Such a massive decline was attributed to the malfunction of interbank money markets, triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers. The two cases have the common starting point of an interbank market participant default.19                                                  14  See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), and Reinhart and Reinhart (2010) for the detailed discussions on recovery patterns after crises. 15  Nakakuki, Otani, and Shiratsuka (2004) make a quantitative assessment on the effects of structural adjustments on economic growth in Japan. 16  For the issues on the “three excesses,” see the 2003-05 issues of the BOJ’s Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. 17  See Greenspan (1999). 18  The failure of medium-sized Sanyo Securities in 1997 led to the first default in interbank money markets in the postwar period in Japan. That triggered sudden liquidity contraction in interbank money markets, immediately spilling over to a wide-range of financial markets. 19  See Nakaso (2001) for the details on Japan’s financial crisis and the BOJ’s role as the lender of last resort. When Sanyo Securities failed, the default of one billion yen in the interbank money markets occurred. 
BIS Review 118/2010 5 Given the serious adverse effects of the failure of medium-sized Sanyo Securities on interbank money markets, at the time of the subsequent and larger failure of Yamaichi Securities, the BOJ committed to providing an unlimited amount of liquidity, thereby enabling its orderly resolution.20 Such policy responses staved off a global financial crisis starting in Japan.21 A series of observations, just I mentioned, show that ensuring funding liquidity is one of the most important prerequisites for achieving stable economic activity, and, to that end, it is crucial to stave off the malfunction of interbank money markets. In addition, I emphasize the importance of differentiating two things in analyzing the economy after the burst of a bubble: the phase of “acute pains” arising from the malfunctioning interbank money markets and the phase of “chronic illnesses” from balance-sheet adjustments. Weakened credit channel The third similarity can be found in the fact that the transmission channels of conventional monetary policy, explained in standard textbooks, did not seem to work well after the burst of a bubble. A typical example can be found in the credit channel. In Japan, the growth in bank lending decelerated rapidly after the burst of the bubble, and continued to remain stagnant for a long time (Chart 17). The growth in bank lending finally turned positive in 2005. Looking at the United States and European countries, the growth in bank lending is still continuing to decline, and the pace of the decline is much faster than that in Japan after the burst of the bubble. In addition, the expansions in the monetary base did not induce an increase in money supply nor bank lending (Chart 18). Before the outbreak of the recent global financial crisis, quantitative easing was frequently proposed as a measure against deflation. Nevertheless, we hardly observe the fact that massive expansions in central bank balance sheets result in an increase in inflation in advanced economies.22 Such fact suggests that conventional monetary policy becomes substantially constrained under the economic circumstances with zero interest rates and on-going balance-sheet adjustments. The effectiveness of unconventional policy measures under the dysfunctional financial system The fourth similarity is related to the fact that various unconventional measures taken by central banks in a crisis produced significant effects on stabilizing the financial system, and thus contributed to minimizing the economic downturn.23 In particular, such unconventional measures were the most effective in the situation that the overall function of the financial                                                                                                                                                       Although the defaulted amount was relatively small, market participants became suddenly cautious about counterparty risk. 20  Due to such policy actions, the liabilities owned by Yamaichi Securities were replaced by those for the BOJ. Of course, an international spillover of the shock could have occurred, if complex securitization schemes had been extensively used at that time. 21  Yamaichi Securities played an important role as one of the four big securities companies in Japan and actively conducted overseas businesses. Due to massive off-the-book liabilities, so-called stock shuffle (loss compensation), Yamaichi’s funding became increasingly tight both at home and abroad. Yamaichi finally decided to go into the voluntary closure of its securities business in November 1997. When Yamaichi failed, the BOJ extended uncollateralized lending in order to support the orderly wind-down of its transactions, some of which turned out to be irrecoverable at the conclusion of Yamaichi’s bankruptcy procedures in January 2005. 22  Posen (2009), using the inflation data in the G7 countries, noted that the only periods where excessive monetary growth led to sustained rises in inflation were during the early and mid-1970s. 23  Bernanke (2009) emphasizes that point. 
6 BIS Review 118/2010 system, including credit markets, deteriorated due to the malfunction of interbank money markets. The success of such measures is essentially due to central banks’ undertaking of counterparty risk and credit risk. Such central banks’ risk-taking is certainly crucial in the phase of “acute pains.” Thus, when examining the effectiveness of monetary policy, or more broadly central bank policy in general, it is crucial to make a clear distinction between the phase of “acute pains” and the phase of “chronic illnesses.” IV.  Things to remember in Interpreting Japan’s experience So far I have discussed the common factors in economic conditions after the burst of a bubble. At the same time, there exist some factors peculiar to Japan’s experience. In monetary policy studies, we need to interpret Japan’s experience with consideration for some differences. Differences in the phase of adopting unconventional measures First, we need to take account of the differences in the phase of adopting unconventional measures. In the malfunction of interbank money markets, unconventional measures were proven effective by Japan’s experience as well as the global financial crisis this time.24 The real issue here is whether unconventional measures, especially quantitative easing or credit easing, are effective in the phase of “chronic illnesses” after such crisis subsides. Empirical studies on Japan mostly show that quantitative easing produced significant effects on stabilizing the financial system, while it had limited effects on stimulating economic activity and prices. Such empirical analyses on the United States and the United Kingdom seem yet to be available at this moment.25 But it seems very difficult to differentiate between the effects from the conventional interest rate channel and those from unconventional measures. That is because such unconventional measures were introduced in the phase of “acute pains” with considerably higher nominal interest rates and credit spreads than those in Japan. By contrast, Japan virtually faced the zero lower bound of nominal interest rates in the second half of 1995, and thus stimulative effects from the conventional interest rate channel were exhausted before the introduction of the zero interest rate policy in February 1999. The effects of demographic changes and productivity declines Second, we need to consider developments on the supply side and the potential growth rate. As standard macroeconomic theory emphasizes, long-term growth is determined by labor force growth and productivity growth. In Japan, labor force growth peaked in the mid-1970s, decelerated thereafter, and turned negative in the mid-1990s (Chart 19). When assessing the factors behind the long-lasting economic stagnation over one or two decades, it is important to focus more on analysis of the real side of the economy.26                                                  24  See Ugai (2007) for comprehensive survey on empirical studies on the effects of the quantitative easing policy in Japan. See also, for example, Gagnon et al. (2010) and Joyce et al. (2010) for empirical studies on the recent experience in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively. Bean et al. (2010) also provide a broader review of monetary policy responses in the recent global financial crisis. 25  Ugai (2007) concludes that effect of expanding the monetary base and altering the composition of the BOJ’s balance sheet, if any, is generally smaller than that stemming from the policy commitment. 26  Hayashi and Prescott (2002) argue that growth theory, treating the economic productivity as exogenous, accounts well for the Japanese lost decade, and call for the analysis about policy change that allows productivity to grow rapidly. See also Rogoff (2010). 
BIS Review 118/2010 7 Such decline in the potential growth rate, and associated downward revision of the public expectations about the future growth rate, seem to produce downward pressure on prices.27 In fact, there exists a significantly positive correlation between the potential growth rate and long-term expectations about inflation in Japan, in contrast to other advance countries (Chart 20). Several interpretations are possible on that observation. For example, it can be considered that a decline in the potential growth rate induces a persistent and significant decline in the natural rate of interest, thus making it difficult for monetary policy to produce sufficient easing effects. Alternatively, economic growth expectations are revised downward, reflecting a decline in the potential growth rate, and a subsequent increase in the discounted present value of future net tax burden and debt-repayment burden to the private sector are likely to restrain private expenditure. Differences in labor practice Third, we also need to pay attention to the differences in labor practice. Japan’s labor practice has a general feature that the dismissal of regular workers is relatively difficult, compared to the U.S. labor practice. As a result, labor costs of regular workers entail the nature of quasi-fixed costs. Under such circumstances, firms have an incentive to cover the fixed costs by lowering sales prices. Price declines in the early stage of the post-bubble period are partly explained by such mechanism.28 As disinflation progressed, Japan tended to set wages in a more flexible manner. Such flexibility in wage setting was attained not only through a reduction in bonus payments and an increase in the number of non-regular workers, but also the downward revision of fixed compensation for regular workers (Chart 21). As mentioned earlier, compared to the United States, price declines in Japan were attributed mostly to declines in services prices. That reflected flexible downward revisions of nominal wages. The propensity to consume in Japan’s household sector increased even under deflation, partly owing to the fact that price declines were driven by unstorable services prices (Chart 22).29 The difference in labor practice is one factor behind the observation that deflation was the severest in Japan among major countries, but never turned into a deflationary spiral. Although ultimately labor practice is determined endogenously, we need to incorporate the differences in labor practice in analyzing the short- to medium-term developments in deflation. Developments in external demand Fourth, we need to take account of an increase in external demand as one of the driving forces behind Japan’s recovery (Chart 23). As I mentioned earlier, the Japanese economy needed the resolution of “three excesses” in the business sector before restoring the full-fledged recovery path. In addition, such recovery in the Japanese economy was also attributed to the increase in external demand since 2003, which was supported by high growth in the global economy under the global credit bubble as well as the depreciation of the Japanese yen. Under the current circumstances, advanced economies need to gain momentum for recovery without relying on the “external” demand, since many economies are affected by the burst of a bubble.                                                  27  See Kimura et al. (2010) and Fujiwara, Hirose, and Shintani (2008). 28  See Kuroda and Yamamoto (2005). 29  The increasing trend in the propensity to consume is also influenced by the aging population. 
8 BIS Review 118/2010 In that sense, we need further analysis with considering the differences in the recovery mechanism after the burst of a bubble, depending on whether one country experiences a bubble or many countries in the world experience a bubble. V.  Future research challenges To conclude my speech today, I will touch upon the challenges to monetary policy studies based on our experience of the financial crisis.30 That said, we are fully aware that many issues have been already raised on various occasions. I thus focus on some relevant, but often missing items in the research agenda related to both conventional and unconventional monetary policies. Speaking of conventional monetary policy, I stress the importance of deepening our understanding about the effectiveness of aggressive policy rate reductions after the burst of a bubble. Before the burst of the bubble this time, the majority view was that aggressive policy rate reductions enabled us to stave off a sharp and serious economic contraction.31 Such optimistic view was challenged by a severe economic contraction in the recent global financial crisis. Such aggressive policy rate reductions are certainly needed to mitigate the economic downturn. Still, we need to recognize some facts in an extremely low interest rate environment. First, when short-term nominal interest rates come down to an extraordinarily low level, the smooth functioning of interbank money markets is undermined and the margin for financial institutions is also reduced. As a result, incentives to extend loans at financial institutions are weakened, resulting in the diminished monetary easing effects.32 Second, protracted low interest rates play an important role in preventing an economic downturn, but, at the same time, they tend to delay adjustment in excesses accumulated during the period of bubble expansion. In addition, they also tend to delay the rejuvenation of businesses.33 Third, expectations about the continuation of low interest rates for a considerable period into future are a necessary condition for a bubble. A bubble does not emerge just from easy monetary policy alone, and, at the same time, it does not emerge without expectations about the continuation of easy monetary policy. In any event, the productivity trend after the burst of a bubble is one of the key factors in defining the macroeconomic performance. If a shock hitting the economy is huge, but temporary, and the natural rate of interest does not decline so much, policy commitment to continuing low interest rates produce certain easing effects through intertemporal substitutions. But, otherwise, policy commitment cannot be effective enough. The comments just I made do not deny the necessity of aggressive policy rate reductions after the burst of a bubble at all. My main point here is that we need to pay more attention to the effects of financial market dynamics caused by behavioral economics elements of market participants. Let me turn to another line of research I think important, that is, unconventional monetary policy. As I discussed earlier, unconventional monetary policy was highly effective against the “acute pains” in the recent financial crisis. We invented various unconventional policy                                                  30  For the importance of revisiting the philosophy behind central bank policy and independence of a central bank in democratic society, not just for monetary policy making, see Shirakawa (2010a, b). 31  See Greenspan (2002), and Mishkin (2007). 32  See Bernanke (2010), and BOE (2009). 33  BIS (2010) points out such possibility. See also Rajan (2010). 
BIS Review 118/2010 9 measures out of necessity. Nevertheless, it is difficult to say that we have a reliable theoretical basis for such policy. We had no choice to “think while running” in formulating such unconventional policy measures. In that sense, I have the impression that it is the translation of accumulated “tacit knowledge” within central banks into practice.34 Central banks thus need to make efforts to transform their “tacit knowledge” into “explicit knowledge.” Through the experience of the recent crisis, I fully recognize that liquidity and counterparty risk are the two most important concepts in conducting a study on unconventional monetary policy. In the recent crisis, various unconventional measures, such as dollar funds-supplying operations and outright purchase of CPs, produced substantial effects. That suggests the necessity of further deepening our understanding of liquidity and counterparty risks. In particular, we need to explore the essential conditions for the smooth functioning of financial markets, especially short-term money markets and foreign exchange markets, with consideration of the behavioral characteristics of market participants and the market microstructure. We thus need to make use of such studies in various activities of central banking, ranging from daily operations to system designs for money market operations, payment and settlement systems, and financial regulation. In closing, I am sure discussions at this conference will be constructive and meaningful. Thank you.                                                  34  For example, Saito, Suzuki, and Yamada (2010) show that markets are able to create collateral assets (relatively safe bonds) in a crisis endogenously by using a model in which a country-specific catastrophic shock was shared between two countries in the presence of solvency constraints. They then discuss a possibility that such endogenous creation of collateral assets in a crisis can be interpreted as a central bank intervention against a crisis.

 BIS Review 117/2010 1 Ardian Fullani: Economic and political challenges of regional cooperation Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the round table entitled “The economic and political challenges of regional cooperation”, Tirana, 8 September 2010. *      *      * Honourable guests, Dear participants, I feel honoured to open today this roundtable. Before anything else I want to welcome our colleagues from Oxford University, who have undertaken an important mission for Albania and the region: contributing to the growth of research capacity, of sapience, and to building of a sustained long-term response to the growth challenges we come through on our common ways, similar but unique, towards the European Union.  It is a great pleasure for me and for the Bank of Albania to have the opportunity to begin a series of studies about the domestic and regional economic policy, which will assist the scientific debate about the economic growth model, also backed by a regional point of view at social, economic and political level. You may ask yourself, why Bank of Albania is so much interested in the economic growth and the economic policies overall, as the main target of the central bank is the stability of prices. In the following minutes I shall try to deal with some of the main points of the Bank of Albania’s agenda in recent years.  In this respect, the efficiency of monetary policy, the importance of internal and external economic anchors, the building up of research capacities for the purpose of implementing our policies, as well as public communication and education. The right addressing of these issues is indispensable for the monetary policy and its crucial role for the economic prosperity.  The successful central banks, whose main target is inflation, are increasingly giving more importance to the economic activity, also to the other indicators of real economy. This trend is not only based on the fact that inflation is directly impacted by the fluctuation of economic activity and unemployment in the short-run, but also on the theory of monetary economics, accordingly the central bank should pay attention to the potential economic growth over the long run as well.  In addition, the argument about economic growth is the key target of the economic policies. Therefore, the decisions of the central bank in the filed of monetary policy, of supervision and of the financial stability, should interact and be harmonised with this central target, thus guaranteeing the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country.  The Central Bank, in this respect, tries that its policies, neither increase the short-term volatility of the economic activity, nor impede the potential economic growth over the long run.  The monetary policy of the Bank of Albania policy is similar to the policy implemented by the European Central Bank; it is based on two pillars: the first is the monetary analysis, and second the economic analysis. The second pillar has a considerable importance for inflation’s performance, particularly in the long-run.  Inflation, in general, is a monetary phenomenon and as such, it depends considerably on the money supply and the pace this latter increases relative to the Gross Domestic Product. The right tie which exists between these variables imposes that the growth of monetary supply in the long-term not be faster than the growth of the economic activity, thus the central bank and its monetary policy not lead to inflation.  
 2 BIS Review 117/2010 Having the maintaining of prices stability and the financial stability as main priorities, the Bank of Albania is determined to make all endeavours to encourage and play an active role in the convergence process of the country with the European standards.  One of the steps to be made immediately in this direction is the compilation of a new economic growth model, which should avoid the weakness of the current model built on the increase and expansion of lending and consumption high levels rates. In May of this year, Bank of Albania held a scientific round table, which was concentrated in the identification of the economy sectors which may provide a stable economic growth in the future. The meeting concluded that the next model of the economic growth imposes the designing of a national strategy for the economic development. at home The next model should be based on the upsurge of output factors in all sectors of the economy.  Given a small-sized and open economy, the increase and stability of exports is of outmost importance. Therefore, the research work, the reforms and the strategic decisions should be adopted in line with this target. In this respect, the role of banking systems acquires a particular importance, which should carefully identify the primary and profitable sectors and should provide their ongoing financing. Banking credit has been and remains one of the main instruments which shall provide the sustainable performance of the economic and financial activity at home.  For this strategy to be successful, it must include as one of its substantial constituents the philosophy and priorities of the Western Balkan regional development. This need does not only derive upon the competition requirements and the achieving of the economy of scale, but also upon our common target for the European integration.  During the recent years, I have continuously highlighted that the key of the successful integration in the European Union is the regional cooperation. There are many reasons backing the conclusion that our models of growth must be seen as complementary and not competitive to each-other. It is indispensable that the complete process of structural reforms takes place quickly and in a coordinated way, which precedes the membership to the European Union.  Only in this way the whole region will converge naturally, avoiding episodes of misbalances within the bosom of the European family upon the membership.  This will be a real contribution to the long-term sustainability of the European developments.  The whole region is going through a political, economic and social consolidation process. The policy-makers, the decision-makers, the examiners and almost everybody declare that their priority is the adherence to the European Union.  The question to ask is if:  we have either to converge towards the European economic zone with small and fragmented economic structures competing with each other for European markets and opportunities,   or embrace a model:   gaining from the economies of scale,  encouraging and exploiting the advantages of the current competitive positions;  that grows the economic prosperity of the whole region and of each individual economy? Personally I think that the second alternative is the contemporary approach that our region should embrace with no hesitation. The success of this process shall depend on all our attempts and devotion to see which our competitive advantages are and to build up the right 
 BIS Review 117/2010 3 economic, financial, legal and physical infrastructure to use and increase these advantages to become competitive in the global economy. Therefore, its is significantly important that the study of the growth model takes place not only from a regional point of view, but to be an approach directed deeply towards the future. The region in itself provides a lot of important advantages:   labour markets amongst the Asiatic countries and of the EU member countries;   the possibilities of high return profit investments against capital, in real estate and infrastructure are huge and attractive for the developed markets;   the region has a population of higher than 20 million inhabitants sharing pleasant demographic characteristics;   the regional tourism is potentiality indispensable as a product of different climacteric combination to geographical features and various ethnical and cultural traditions.  Preliminary results of empiric researches in the Bank of Albania show that the economic possibilities to exploit from regional countries are huge.  Our analysis of external trade, based on gravity models, reveal that external trade of Albania with EU partners stays at optimum levels, while trade with the region is under its potentiality.   What does hamper our regional trade to achieve the potentiality?   What do we need to undertake coordinated structural reforms at regional level?   Are we encountering a weakening in coordinating the policies, information sharing, the establishment of institutions, the current legal infrastructure, or lobbing in European structures?   How much possible is the synchronisation of the efforts for more effective and efficient convergence and the integration process?   Which are the main economic and political fields where we may find larger space for the achievement of common regional polices?   How has the last global financial and economical crisis impacted the Albanian economy, the regional economy and more priority the convergence process?   Can we afford it? All these are very important issues on which I think we should stop and study in deep. They are subject of research work, whose findings shall light the orientation of economic and structural reforms. Given that, the Bank of Albania has joint the forces with the University of Oxford to carry out a scientific research dedicated to the finding of the answers for the above questions and other similar.  Answers to these fundamental issues benefit not only Albania and its regional partners, but also the EU and its political and economical structures. I am confident that the European Commission may exploit the outcomes of these scientific researches to build up new anchors, as economic and political incentives in order to increase the efficiency of all regional sources.  These studies shall help us to better see that: What and how should be done to return EU, its Pre-adhering Economic Programs and Fiscal Economic Programs into stronger external anchors for the national and regional policies.  However, it is important to realise that international restrictions can not support the long-term sustainable prosperity in absence of internal anchors.  
 4 BIS Review 117/2010 Obligations that may be imposed from Brussels or from other international organisations are indispensable as long the internal anchors are fragile. Therefore, it is necessary the society itself and international institutions support the establishment and strengthening of internal anchors.  Which would be an efficient internal anchor?  I think that the best internal anchor is a technician who thinks independently, proud of what he does, conscious for the results and the consequences of the proper actions.  In other words, this implies the establishment of professional capacities as one of the cornerstones of long-term successful polices. The scientific education and research in this direction have an important and inalienable role.  All the issues mentioned so far, as:   The new strategic model of economic growth;   The effective, efficient and consistent monetary policies with the economic growth;  The necessity for coordinated structural reforms in the region;  The challenges to European integration;   The common political economy of the region in the future;   The importance of internal anchors and the study and research of external ones, and;   The need for establishing capacities;  are included in the research work’s agenda of the Bank of Albania.  It is a great pleasure that we already have the possibility to cooperate with a remarkable partner as Oxford University, a distinguished institution for the high-level research in political and economic sciences.  For this collaboration, I hope and I believe that many issues I discussed above would have an answer, partial or a complete one. The one thing I strongly desire is the involvement of as many domestic and regional researchers.  I would like to guarantee all the interested persons that we are open in this direction. On the other hand, I am confident that the collaboration we made official today, shall provide a sensitive contribution towards the education and establishment of professional capacities at national level.  Please allow me to close my speech returning once more to the argument of professional technicians. I still think that   We need to educate our technicians;   Furthermore, we should make them independent financially and politically;  And afterwards, we should educate them again.  On the other hand, the building of capacities is not an “individual” issue; it is an institutions’ issue; in fact it is a process independent from human resources.  This because capacities should be based on “processes” and not on people, for long-living. The good anchors are not used only from institutions which relate policies with them. They are instruments in the hand of public, as strong arguments to encourage government’s agencies towards the compilation and implementation of long term sustainable polices.  I believe that the European values may play decisive role in this direction, by strengthening and supporting the establishment of respected institutions, where the criticism occurs 
 BIS Review 117/2010 5 independently from the political processes and targets. That is the reason we have chosen the collaboration with the Oxford University.  
 BIS Review 117/2010 1 Mark Carney: 7th Bundesbank Lecture 2010 – the economic consequences of the reforms Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the 7th Bundesbank Lecture 2010, Berlin, 14 September 2010. *      *      * “The power to become habituated to his surroundings is a marked characteristic of mankind... We assume some of the most peculiar and temporary of our late advantages as natural, permanent, and to be depended on, and we lay our plans accordingly. On this sandy and false foundation we scheme for social improvement and dress our political platforms.” – J. M. Keynes, The Economic Consequences of the Peace Introduction Keynes wrote prophetically of the economic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles. Could the same be said of current financial reforms? Are policy-makers taking for granted the essential role performed by finance in a vain pursuit of its risk-proofing? Do we assume that our “late advantage” of an open, global capital market and trade environment is a “natural, permanent” feature of the economic landscape?  Or is the other extreme possible? Are we being too timid? Consider the jaded attitudes of the bank CEO who recounted: “My daughter called me from school one day, and said, ‘Dad, what’s a financial crisis?’ And, without trying to be funny, I said, ‘This type of thing happens every five to seven years.’”1  Should we be content with a dreary cycle of upheaval? Such resignation would be costly. Even after heroic efforts to limit its impact on the real economy, the global financial crisis left a legacy of foregone output, lost jobs, and enormous fiscal deficits. As is typically the case, much of the cost has been borne by countries, businesses, and individuals who did not directly contribute to the fiasco.  If what’s past is prologue, growth will be lower and unemployment higher for years to come. The Bank of Canada forecasts that, as a result of the crisis, cumulative foregone economic output from 2009 to 2012 will be 16 per cent of GDP in Europe and 9 per cent of GDP in Canada (see Appendix, Chart 1). Over the longer term, we estimate that these shortfalls could grow to about 40 per cent and 30 per cent of respective GDP. Given the synchronous nature of this global crisis, there are reasons to fear such severe outcomes.  Surely, and contrary to what some in the industry would have you believe, there is some price worth paying to reduce such tail risks in the future. This past weekend’s historic Basel III agreement strikes exactly the right balance. In my remarks today, I will focus on the costs and benefits of financial sector reform. I will argue that the economic case is compelling and the basic stakes enormous. Financial crises are normally followed by financial repression; economic downturns, by increased protectionism. Without credible, coordinated financial reforms, we risk losing the open trading and financial system that has underpinned the economic miracle of recent times.                                                   1  J.

 2 BIS Review 117/2010 The role of the financial sector Before analysing the impact of the reforms, allow me to discuss briefly the role of the financial sector and how it failed during the crisis.  By translating savings into productive investment, finance is central to economic growth. It has three core functions. First, through the payments system, it facilitates decentralized exchange, which is fundamental to the functioning of a market economy.  Second, finance transforms the maturities of assets and liabilities, taking short-term liabilities, such as deposits, and transforming them into long-term assets, such as mortgages or corporate loans. Households and businesses can therefore do the reverse, holding short-term assets and longer-term liabilities. This helps them to plan for the future and to manage risks arising from uncertainties over their cash flows. The social value of maturity transformation is unquestioned, but its performance creates fundamental risks, which requires public intervention.2  Third, the financial system intermediates credit, channelling funds from savers to investors. This allows savers to diversify their risk and everyone to smooth consumption over time and across states of the world. Young families can borrow to buy a house; students can pay for university. People can invest for their retirements and businesses can finance working capital and investment. However, if risk is persistently mispriced, these savings and investments will be misallocated and economic welfare reduced. The crisis  Financial services are supplied by a combination of banks and markets. In recent years, markets grew to the point that they became important alternatives to banks for corporate and household finance. More and more of the traditional functions of banks – including maturity transformation and credit intermediation – were conducted through a broader range of intermediaries and investment vehicles, which have been collectively referred to as the “shadow banking” system.3 All countries participated in these trends, to varying degrees. From a financial system perspective, the deepening of markets is generally welcome because it makes the system more robust and increases competition. However, while markets expand the choices and lower the prices available to financial consumers, they function differently from banks. Unlike banks, markets rely more completely on confidence for liquidity. To maintain that confidence, markets need clear rules and robust infrastructure.  In response to the increased competitive pressure from markets, banks employed three strategies: increasing leverage, greater use of securitization, and the writing of deep out-of-the-money options. Though not recognised at the time, each increased risk in the system. By borrowing in short-term wholesale markets to fund asset growth, banks became more dependent on continuous access to liquidity in money and capital markets.  By using securitization to diversify the funding sources and reduce credit risks, banks created new exposures. The severing of the relationship between originator and risk holder lowered underwriting and monitoring standards. In addition, the transfer of risk itself was frequently                                                  2  To manage the fundamental risk created by maturity mismatch, banks rely on two crucial supports: deposit insurance and the central bank as a lender of last resort to solvent but illiquid institutions. Banks implicitly accept a social contract that gives them access to liquidity support in times of stress in return for regulation of their behaviour at all times. 3  Shadow banks included investment banks, mortgage brokers, finance companies, structured investment vehicles, hedge funds, and other private asset pools. 
 BIS Review 117/2010 3 incomplete, with banks retaining large quantities of supposedly risk-free leveraged super senior tranches of structured products.  These exposures were compounded by the rapid expansion of banks into over-the-counter derivative products. In essence, banks wrote a series of large out-of-the-money options in markets such as those for credit default swaps.4 As credit standards deteriorated, the tail risks embedded in these strategies became fatter. With pricing and risk management lagging reality, there was a widespread misallocation of capital. The magnitude of these developments was remarkable. In the final years of the boom, when complacency about liquidity reached its zenith, the scale of shadow banking activity exploded. The value of structured investment vehicles, for example, tripled in the three years to 2007. Credit default swaps grew sixfold.  Financial institutions, including many banks, came to rely on high levels of liquidity in markets. Short-term money markets were the predominant source of financing for the one-third increase in the gross leverage of U.S. investment banks, U.K. banks, and European banks. The system’s exposure to market confidence was enormous. Through all of this, a mirage formed of relentlessly expanding profitability in the financial sector. In the United States, between 2000 and 2006, corporate profits in the sector averaged over 36 per cent of total profits. It appeared briefly that finance was the ruler, rather than a servant of, the real economy. The large losses and costly bailouts required to repair balance sheets shattered this illusion.5  The shortcomings of regulation were similarly exposed. The shadow banking system was not supported, regulated, or monitored in the same fashion as the conventional banking system, despite the fact they were of equal size on the eve of the crisis.6  There were also major flaws in the regulation and supervision of banks themselves. Basel II fed procyclicalities, underestimated risks, and permitted excess leverage. Gallingly, on the day before each went under, every bank that failed (or was saved by the state) reported capital that exceeded the Basel II standard by a wide margin. Most fundamentally, the global financial crisis revealed the fallacy of composition that strong individual financial institutions collectively ensure the safety and soundness of the system as a whole. Even the most vigilant, microprudential regulatory regime can be overwhelmed by systemic risks. As a consequence, policy-makers now recognise that systemic risk is the product of the resiliency of financial institutions, the robustness of systemically important markets, and the interconnectedness between institutions and markets. The G-20 reform agenda The G-20 has initiated an extensive program of reform designed to improve the safety and robustness of the global financial system. The measures are mutually reinforcing, and all are necessary.                                                   4  See A. Haldane, “The Contribution of the Financial Sector – Miracle or Mirage?” Speech delivered at the Future of Finance Conference, London, 14 July 2010. 5  It was not just a question of misleading data on profitability. The basic shortcoming of financial growth accounting also plagued compensation structures. Employees were paid in cash for positive net present value of long-tailed risks. 6  Z. Pozsar, T. Adrian, A. Ashcraft, and H. Boesky, ”Shadow Banking”, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 458, July 2010. 
 4 BIS Review 117/2010 Building robust markets  The first strategy is to build robust financial markets by improving infrastructure and transparency. In particular, keeping markets continuously open requires policies and infrastructure that reinforce the private generation of liquidity in normal times and facilitate central bank support in times of crisis. The cornerstone is clearing and settlement processes with risk-reducing elements, particularly central clearing counterparties or “CCPs” for repos and OTC derivatives. Properly risk-proofed CCPs act as firewalls against the propagation of default shocks across major market participants. Through centralised clearing, authorities can also require the use of through-the-cycle margins, which would reduce liquidity spirals and their contribution to boom-bust cycles.7  Reducing the interconnectedness between institutions and markets  The second G-20 imperative is to create a system that can withstand the failure of any single financial institution. From Bear Stearns to Hypo Real Estate to Lehman Brothers, markets failed that test.  Today, after a series of extraordinary, but necessary, measures to keep the system functioning, we are awash in moral hazard. If left unchecked, this will distort private behaviour and inflate public costs.  As a consequence, there is a firm conviction among policy-makers that losses incurred in future crises must be borne by the institutions themselves. This means management, shareholders, and creditors, rather than taxpayers.  Measures to expose fully firms to the ultimate sanction of the market will also reduce the interconnectedness between institutions. In addition to changes to market infrastructure, priorities include: staged-intervention regulatory regimes, “living wills” for banks, and better cross-border resolution regimes.  Another promising avenue is to embed contingent capital features into debt and preferred shares issued by financial institutions. Contingent capital is a security that converts to capital when a financial institution is in serious trouble, thereby replenishing capital without the use of taxpayer funds. Contingent conversions could be embedded in all future new issues of senior unsecured debt and subordinated securities to create a broader bail-in approach. Its presence would also discipline management, since common shareholders would be incented to act prudently to avoid having their stakes diluted by conversion. Overall, the Bank of Canada believes that contingent capital can reduce moral hazard and increase the efficiency of bank capital structures. We correspondingly welcome the Basel Committee’s recent public consultation paper on this topic.  Improving the resiliency of financial institutions  The third priority is to improve the resiliency of financial institutions themselves. Creating more resilient institutions requires more and better capital, improved balance sheet liquidity, and enhanced risk management.8 This past weekend’s Basel III agreement delivers on these objectives by:                                                  7  Market resiliency can also be improved through better and more-readily available information. This reduces information asymmetry, facilitates the valuation process and, hence, supports market efficiency and stability. In this regard, priorities are an expansion of the use of trade repositories for OTC derivatives markets and substantial enhancements to continuous disclosure standards for securitization. 8  The crisis also underscored the need to better capture counterparty exposures, market risk, and a host of contingent claims. 
 BIS Review 117/2010 5  Creating global standards for liquidity.   Raising substantially the quantity, quality, consistency, and transparency of the Tier 1 capital base.   Introducing a leverage ratio as a complement to the Basel II risk-based framework. The leverage ratio is, in effect, a safety harness that is designed to protect against risks that regulators think are low but which, in fact, are not.   Introducing a capital conservation buffer above the minimum capital requirement to ensure that banks and supervisors take prompt corrective action and that banks can absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. This conservation buffer is to be complemented by a countercyclical buffer, which would vary over time. It should be at its maximum in periods when credit is growing rapidly and system-wide risks are rising. In times of stress, the buffer would be reduced to ensure that the flow of credit is not undermined by regulatory constraints.  The goal is to make financial systems less vulnerable to booms and busts so that crises are less frequent and less severe. Through evidence-based analysis, policy-makers can determine the package of reforms that will maximise these net economic benefits.  It is to this issue that I will now turn. The benefits of reform  The potential economic benefits of stronger capital and liquidity standards are significant. These benefits emerge from a variety of sources:   Higher capital and liquidity standards will contribute to a lower incidence of financial crises.   The severity of financial crises could also be reduced.   The economy should benefit from smoother economic cycles.   Higher standards should help to reduce the risk that resources are misallocated.  To put the magnitude of potential gains into context, consider more closely the costs of financial crises. In the 10 years following a financial crisis, the median output growth rate decreases by 1 per cent, and the unemployment rate increases by 5 percentage points.9 Experience suggests that costs build well into the future. In studies released last month, the Basel Committee found that the median cumulative loss of past financial crises was 63 per cent of national GDP.  Given the scale of potential losses, there are clearly large benefits to reducing the frequency of crises (Chart 2). The extensive analysis of the Basel Committee suggests that higher capital and liquidity standards would do just that. In particular, the combination of strengthened liquidity standards and a 2-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios would raise the annual expected level of GDP by 1.8 per cent relative to trend.                                                   9  See C. Reinhart and V. Reinhart, “After the Fall”, forthcoming in Macroeconomic Policy: Post-Crisis and Risks Ahead, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Policy Symposium, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 26–28 August 2010. 
 6 BIS Review 117/2010 Because this improved performance accrues over time, it is a gift that keeps on giving. Using a conservative real discount rate of 5 per cent, the cumulative present value of this better performance is equivalent to more than 35 per cent of GDP, or €0.9 trillion for Germany.10  Some in Canada argue that our sound financial system implies that the potential gains are small for our country and the G-20 reforms are, therefore, unimportant. This is misguided. In open economies such as ours and Germany’s, reducing the incidence of foreign crises is even more important than domestic benefits. Today’s reality is one of deep interconnectedness, where financial problems in other regions spill rapidly into our own. In an increasingly multi-polar economy, we simply cannot afford to lurch from crisis to crisis every five years. To reduce this frequency, we need a strong, universally applied framework. The Basel III rules, combined with the FSB and IMF’s review processes, have the potential to be just that. Costs of reform  Despite the clear benefits, stronger prudential standards also impose costs.  Banks can follow several strategies to meet regulatory demands for higher capital requirements. Most obviously, they could raise additional capital in public markets. If given sufficient time, they could generate capital internally through retained earnings. In addition, they could pass on some of the costs of the higher standards to their customers through higher interest spreads or increased fee income. Finally, they could shed, or slow the growth, of assets.  Past experience suggests that banks will use a combination of all these methods.11 However, to be conservative, the Basel report assumes that banks would recoup the cost of higher capital and liquidity requirements entirely through higher lending spreads. The long-term estimate of the increase in lending spreads is then used as an input to a variety of models to assess the impact on output. By combining strengthened liquidity standards with a 2-percentage-point increase in bank capital ratios, expected output growth, relative to trend, is reduced by 0.25 per cent on average for the countries analysed (0.30 per cent for Canada). In present-value terms, this equates to about 5 per cent of GDP.  Together with these long-run costs, there are also costs incurred during the transition period. The Basel study estimates these through a sophisticated approach using a wide range of models.12 The result for the group is a 1.1 per cent cumulative reduction in GDP over a four-year transition period (in present value).  A conservative estimate of the net benefits Netting the long-run benefits of less frequent financial crises with the long-run and transition costs yields average net benefits for G-20 economies of 30 per cent of GDP in present-value terms, or about €10 trillion (Table 1).13                                                   10  The Bank of Canada estimates the equivalent figures for Canada would be 1.1 per cent and 20 per cent of GDP. 11  The longer the transition period is, the more important the internal generation of earnings will be. 12  It was necessary to make a number of assumptions in this analysis. For example, it was typically assumed that monetary policy would respond to mitigate the effects of the more stringent bank capital and liquidity requirements. It was also important to include the spillover effects that occur across borders, magnifying the impact on output. 13  Assuming a 2-percentage-point increase in capital (plus liquidity changes). For Canada, estimates are approximately 13 per cent of GDP in present-value terms, which is equal to about Can$200 billion (Tables 2 and 3). 
 BIS Review 117/2010 7 This estimate is conservative. The analysis understates the benefits of the new rules and errs on the side of overstating the costs. This bias is reflected in several key assumptions.  First, banks are assumed to fully pass on the costs of higher capital and liquidity requirements to borrowers rather than reducing their current returns on shareholders’ equity or operating expenses, such as compensation, to adjust to the new rules.  Consider the alternative. If banks were to reduce personnel expenses by only 10 per cent (equal to a 5 per cent reduction in operating expenses), they could lower spreads by an amount that would completely offset the impact of a 2-percentage-point increase in capital requirements. Second, higher capital and liquidity requirements are assumed to have a permanent effect on lending spreads, and hence on the level of economic output. No allowance is made for the possibility that households and firms may find cheaper alternative sources of financing.  Third, the discount rate used to calculate net benefits was more than twice current real interest rates and the longer-run real growth rates of the Canadian and German economies.  Finally, the only benefit quantified is the gains to GDP resulting from a reduced probability of future financial crises.  Other benefits from financial reforms are substantial  However, there are a variety of other potential benefits from higher capital and liquidity standards and the broader range of G-20 reforms. First, the variability of economic cycles should be reduced by a host of macroprudential measures. Analysis by the Bank of Canada and the Basel group suggests a modest dampening in output volatility can be achieved from the Basel III proposals, as higher capital and liquidity allow banks to smooth the supply of credit over the cycle. For instance, a 2-percentage-point rise in capital ratios lowers the standard deviation of output by about 3 per cent.  A much more significant impact can be expected from other macroprudential instruments under consideration. These include varying loan-to-value and other credit terms in mortgage markets, adopting through-the-cycle margining in core funding markets, and the introduction of countercyclical capital buffers.  The Bank of Canada has modelled the potential impact of such a time-varying buffer and translated the gains from reduced volatility into domestic consumption and GDP. The preliminary findings suggest that the potential gains are in the range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent of GDP in present-value terms. In other words, countercyclical buffers alone could increase the net benefits of reforms by about 20 per cent. It is reasonable to expect similar results for other countries.14  Second, there is a range of initiatives under consideration to reduce moral hazard, including new frameworks for the effective resolution of banks, more intensive supervision of key institutions, the introduction of contingent capital, and the creation of more robust infrastructure. Adoption of these measures should further reinforce the ability of Basel III standards to reduce the probability of crises and thereby increase net benefits.                                                  14  See C. Meh and K. Moran, “The Role of Bank Capital in the Propagation of Shocks”, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control 34: 555–76 (2010); I. Christensen, C. Meh, and K. Moran, “Bank Leverage Regulation and Macroeconomic Dynamics”, forthcoming Bank of Canada Working Paper (2010); A. Dib, “Banks, Credit Market Frictions, and Business Cycles”, forthcoming Bank of Canada Working Paper (2010). 
 8 BIS Review 117/2010 Third, the totality of the G-20 reforms has the potential to shift the balance between resiliency and competition. By creating a system that is robust to the failure of a single firm, reforms could increase the competitive intensity in the financial services sector, with attendant benefits. A financial sector that is less volatile, less prone to debilitating crises, and more robust in the face of adverse shocks is likely to be viewed more favourably by investors and attract the investment needed to continue to expand in a sustainable manner. By reducing moral hazard, incumbents will also enjoy fewer oligopolistic privileges behind regulatory barriers to entry. Greater competition commonly leads to more innovative and diverse strategies, which would further promote resiliency of the system. Greater competition and safer banks may also contribute to lower expected return on equity (ROE) for financial institutions. This, in turn, could help offset the costs and increase the net benefits discussed earlier.  These gains from competition could be considerable. The financial services sector earns a 50 per cent higher return on equity than the economy-wide average. If greater competition leads to a one-percentage-point decline in the ROE (through a decline in spreads), the estimated cost from a one-percentage point increase in capital would be completely offset. Conclusion The fundamental objective of the reforms is to create a system that efficiently supports economic growth while providing financial consumers with choice. The system must be robust to shocks, dampening, rather than amplifying, their effect on the real economy. It should also support sensible innovation. The system needs stable banks and robust markets, since both play a central role in financing, and, if properly structured, each can support the other. This means ensuring that individual financial institutions are stronger and less systemically important, that more options for liquidity are available in all states of the world, and that the new measures promote competition.  A fully risk-proofed system is neither attainable nor desirable. The point is not to pile up so much capital in our institutions that they are never heard from again, either as a source of instability or of growth. The challenge is to get the balance between resiliency and efficiency right. The Basel III agreement accomplishes these objectives. Moreover, a careful analysis indicates that the economic case for the reforms is compelling. Most fundamentally, successful implementation of the G-20 agenda will increase the likelihood of an open, flexible international financial and trading system. Modern Germany has prospered in this environment and has a great stake in leading the G-20 in building a more secure foundation for modern prosperity.  The Bundesbank has led the development of many of these reforms. Tremendous progress was made this past weekend, but there is still more to do. Germany’s continued leadership in the coming weeks and months will be critical, so that we can finish building a solid financial foundation for growth and social improvement. We should all heed the words of President Weber: "Policy-makers now have to muster the political will to take the necessary steps, however contested and painful they might be”.15  Thank you.                                                  15  A.

 BIS Review 116/2010 1 Mark Carney: Restoring faith in the international monetary system Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Spruce Meadows Changing Fortunes Round Table, Calgary, Alberta,10 September 2010. *      *      * Introduction We are three years into the global financial crisis, and its dynamics still dominate the economic outlook. In particular, broad forces of bank, household, and sovereign deleveraging can be expected to add to the variability and temper the pace of global economic growth in the years ahead. This would be true even if policy were optimal; but globally, this is not the case.  One of the reasons is the functioning of the current international monetary system. It promoted the enormous build-up of debt that preceded the crisis and could complicate the necessary process of balance-sheet repair in its wake. It is fostering deflationary risks in major advanced economies and asset-price inflation in emerging markets. For countries like Canada, the outlook and policy environment remain unusually challenging.  It is in this context that the international monetary system is being re-examined. The question is whether to change the system or to change policies to be consistent with the current system.  I will argue today that there is no miracle cure. Faith is required, but not in a barbarous relic or a utopian global central bank. Rather, countries must restore their faith in the adjustment process under the current system. Both the G-20 framework and its financial reforms are necessary to restore that trust.  The international monetary system and the crisis The international monetary system consists of (i) exchange rate arrangements; (ii) capital flows; and (iii) a collection of institutions, rules, and conventions that governs its operation. These core elements are supplemented in two important ways. Domestic monetary policy frameworks are essential components of the global system. The international monetary system is also closely related to the international financial system, which comprises financial markets and the institutions, rules, and regulations that govern them.  The international monetary system is an increasingly unstable hybrid of fixed and floating regimes. Following the breakdown of Bretton Woods, there was a general move to a more market-based system with an increasing number of countries adopting floating exchange rates and steadily liberalizing their capital accounts. Capital flows exploded, rising three times faster than the rate of growth of trade over the past three decades. In contrast, in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, a range of emerging markets became increasingly active managers of their exchange rates. As a by-product, with foreign exchange reserves built well beyond prudential levels, these countries have become important players in several key asset markets.  The combination of these official assets and private flows has created huge gross international asset positions, which has important implications for the functioning of the international monetary system.1 This makes internationally coordinated financial supervision                                                  1  M.

 2 BIS Review 116/2010 and regulation a pre-requisite for system stability. It also increases the returns to deepening the liquidity of non-reserve currencies.  Well-functioning markets have clear rules of engagement and robust infrastructure. That cannot be said of the current system. Its conventions can be best described as the occasional observance of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Its governance is diffuse and ineffective. The IMF is effectively without the power of sanction, and informal governance mechanisms such as the G-7 have increasingly lost legitimacy as global economic power has been transformed.  Moreover, events of the last few years exposed the frailties of the international financial system. A number of global banks were woefully under-capitalised; participants assumed markets would be liquid in all states of the world; and incentive problems led to a dramatic underpricing of risks. It is now clear that, in the run-up to the crisis, financial regulation was neither well-conceived nor well-coordinated. Implementation was uneven and peer review non-existent.  When the crisis hit, liquidity became concentrated in a handful of markets and one currency. In the wake of the large, negative spillovers we have all just experienced, changes are clearly required.  This need is doubly important as unprecedented structural changes in the global economy are straining the international monetary system itself. The integration of one-third of humanity into today’s global economy dwarfs the shock experienced when Canada and the United States emerged at the turn of the last century (Chart 1). The global economy is rapidly becoming multi-polar. Emerging-market economies are now the main drivers of commodity prices, they represent almost one-half of the growth in all imports over the past decade, and currently account for about two-thirds of global growth.2  Any monetary system would be fragile in the face of these large, positive forces. There is cause for concern that the current system will repeat the failures of its predecessors.  History shows that international systems dominated by fixed exchange rates seldom cope well with major structural change.3 This failure is the result of two pervasive problems: the downward rigidity of nominal prices and wages and an asymmetric adjustment process. In the short run, it is generally much less costly, economically as well as politically, for countries with balance of payments surpluses to maintain them and accumulate reserves than it is for deficit countries to sustain deficits. Countries with deficits must either run down their reserves or deflate their currencies. The only limit on reserve accumulation for surplus countries is its ultimate impact on domestic prices. Depending on the openness of the financial system and the degree of sterilization, this impact can be delayed for a very long time.  Such has been the case in recent years (Table 1). Indeed, given the scale of the economic miracle, it is remarkable that the currencies of the BRICs have only appreciated 5 per cent in real terms against the G-7 over the past decade (Chart 2).  Another lesson from history is that major countries will not pursue policies that they do not perceive to be in their self-interest. Export-oriented growth strategies, supported in part by undervalued currencies, have proven effective catalysts in recent decades. Countries have generally been reluctant to adjust even long after demand needs to be rebalanced and the desire to self-insure has been sated. There are, however, deeper causes of the inertia of today’s emerging-market economies (EMEs).

 BIS Review 116/2010 3 monetary system have discouraged co-operative solutions; and legitimate concerns over the resiliency of the global financial system have slowed financial liberalisation.  Emerging markets have also been somewhat slow in realising that, as they grow in importance, delayed adjustment is becoming self-defeating. Given the economic importance of emerging markets, their policy decisions are material for the stability of the international monetary system, and therefore for strong, sustainable and balanced global growth. In the end, excessive reserve accumulation represents a fallacy of composition. These efforts to secure the stability of one country are now collectively reducing the stability of the system.4  The flip side of large current account surpluses was large current account deficits in several advanced economies, notably the United States. The combination of expansionary U.S. monetary and fiscal policies following the 2001 recession and high savings rates in East Asia generated significant global imbalances, massive capital flows, and the “conundrum” of very low, long-term interest rates. These low, risk-free rates, in turn, fed the search for yield and excessive leverage across the system. The deregulation of housing and consumer finance reinforced a secular decline in private savings.  Vulnerabilities grew from the combination of macro imbalances and micro failings in risk management, supervision, and financial regulation. Policy-makers in advanced economies were too slow to recognise and address the looming risks. The overall result was a period of increasingly unbalanced growth, without the real and financial signals necessary to promote timely and orderly economic adjustment.  Three years ago, the pressures became overwhelming. Financial systems in advanced economies seized up; virtually every financial asset in the world was repriced; and private demand in advanced economies collapsed.  The policy response to the crash has been an unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy. This has bought time for the necessary adjustments. But a durable solution requires a rebalancing of global supply and demand, which will not happen without changes to the functioning of both the international monetary and financial systems.  The challenges ahead Without the successful completion of G-20 reforms, the current recovery is at risk. Structural changes in the global economy will eventually yield important adjustments in real exchange rates. These would be most effectively achieved through movements in nominal exchange rates, allowing relative wages and prices to adjust quickly and symmetrically to restore external balance.  However, lacking confidence in the international monetary and financial systems, countries are resisting such nominal adjustments. As a result, real exchange rate adjustment is more likely to occur through changes in general wages and prices. The implications for asset prices, output, and employment could be considerable.  Already, inflationary pressures are rising in emerging economies (Chart 3). Given divergent growth and inflation prospects, monetary policy suitable for United States may not be appropriate for most other countries (Chart 4). However, those countries with relatively fixed exchange rates and relatively open capital accounts are acting as though it is. If this divergence in optimal monetary policy stance persists, the existing strains on the system will grow.  In some major advanced economies, deflationary pressures are emerging. Given the fiscal constraints and scale of balance-sheet repair that is necessary, these economies have a                                                  4  Obstfeld, 2010.

External competitiveness needs to be rebuilt through changes to nominal exchange rates or, failing that lower domestic wages and prices.  The dynamic is perhaps most stark in peripheral Europe where the first option is not available. The current frustration of adjustment by surplus countries, if perpetuated, risks creating a similar dynamic on a global scale. History suggests that this process could take years, repressing global output and welfare in the interim.  Against these difficult dynamics, the major economies are locked into what Larry Summers once termed “the balance of financial terror.”5 Reserves are highly concentrated by holder (the top five countries hold roughly 50 per cent) and currency (two-thirds are in U.S. dollars). Reserve accumulators trade exchange rate stability for exposure to large capital losses if the dollar were to depreciate. They confer the exorbitant privilege of lower financing costs to the United States, the principal supplier of reserve currency. The United States faces the risk that this support is suddenly withdrawn, triggering a sharp adjustment.  All are aware that the decisions, actual or perceived, of a few sovereigns can have a disproportionate, disruptive impact on a range of asset prices and, ultimately, global output.  What then should be done? First, maintaining an open global financial system is incredibly important. Sovereign borrowing needs and business investment requirements will be considerable. It would be sheer incompetence to move from a world with a savings glut to one that is capital starved. One of the tail risks at present is the possible repeat of the Great Reversal of globalization in the aftermath of the crash of 1929.6 Rather than turning our backs on financial globalization, we need to build resilient globalization by changing the design and operation of both the international monetary and financial systems. Buttressing the institutions and rules that support cross-border finance is thus essential.  Second, a new reserve asset is not required. Over the longer term, it is possible to envision a system with other reserve currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar. However, with few alternatives ready to assume the role, the U.S. dollar can be expected to remain the principal reserve currency for the foreseeable future. Despite the exuberant pessimism reflected in the gold price, total gold stocks represent only US$1 trillion or about 10 per cent of global reserves and a much smaller proportion of global money supply.7 The renminbi’s prospects are moot, absent full convertibility and open capital markets, which would themselves likely do much to reduce pressure for a change.  At first glance, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) would be an intriguing alternative reserve asset.8 Using SDRs appeals to a sense of fairness, in that no one country would enjoy the exorbitant privilege of reserve currency status. Like a multiple reserve currency system, it may reduce the aggregate incentives of countries that supply the consistent currencies of the SDR to run deficits. In addition, there appears to be no technical reason why the use of SDRs could not be expanded.                                                   5  L.H.

 BIS Review 116/2010 5 However, merely enhancing the role of the SDR would do little either to increase the flexibility of the system or change the incentives of surplus countries.9 Changes to reserve currencies would not increase confidence in the global financial system. More generally, alternatives to the dollar as reserve currency would not materially improve the functioning of the system. While reserve alternatives would increase pressures on the United States to adjust, since “artificial” demand for their assets would be shared with others, incentives for the surplus countries that have thwarted adjustment would not change.  The common lesson of the gold standard, the Bretton Woods system, and the current hybrid system is that it is the adjustment mechanism, not the choice of reserve asset that ultimately matters.  There is no silver bullet; a constellation of policies across major economic areas is required. The answer to the question I posed at the outset is not to change the current system, but rather to change policies to be consistent with it. Changing policies will require countries to change their macro policies and all countries to agree on a series of financial reforms.  The G-20 framework and globally coherent policy With the burden squarely on policy dialogue and cooperation, the G-20 has assumed a central role.  The G-20 framework stresses countries’ shared responsibility to ensure that their policies support strong, sustainable, and balanced growth. Under the framework, members have agreed to a mutual assessment of their monetary, exchange rate, fiscal, financial, and structural policies.  There are several reasons why this process has the potential to encourage action across a range of countries. There is a clear timetable. A comprehensive set of policies are under consideration. Policy-makers at the highest levels are directly involved, supported by international financial institutions. Finally, discussions are taking place at the G-20, where all major economies are present and where China has assumed a very constructive leadership role.  As is often the case, the first step to solving a problem has been to admit that it exists. With growing recognition of the shared challenges, countries have agreed to do what is necessary to secure the global recovery in the short term and to facilitate adjustment over the medium term.  More tangibly, at the Toronto leaders’ summit, advanced economies committed to complete fiscal stimulus programs and implement growth friendly fiscal consolidation. EMEs committed to reduce their reliance on foreign demand and boost internal sources of growth by (i) targeting infrastructure spending; (ii) reducing excessive precautionary saving; and (iii) increasing exchange rate flexibility.  Time will tell whether G-20 nations can better the underwhelming track record of the G-7 in coordinating policies. The area with the best prospects for success is in financial reforms.                                                   9  SDRs could catalyze that change by facilitating any desired reserve diversification. Establishing an enhanced substitution account at the IMF, on a temporary basis, would allow large reserve holders to exchange U.S.-dollar reserves for SDR-denominated securities, thereby diversifying their portfolios. With the IMF bearing the risk of changes in the U.S.-dollar exchange rate, an appropriate burden-sharing arrangement among its members would have to be agreed upon. A substitution account would create considerable moral hazard, since reserve holders would be tempted to engage in further accumulation. In addition, a substitution account would not address the fundamental asymmetry of the adjustment process. Thus, it would appear essential that a substitution account mark the transition from the current hybrid system to an international system characterized by more flexible exchange rates for all systemic countries. 
 6 BIS Review 116/2010 Given the scale of international asset positions, progress on financial reforms is essential. These are also proceeding with a focus on three core issues:   improving the resiliency of institutions (raising the quality and level of capital);  building robust markets (improving infrastructure and enhancing transparency); and,  reducing interconnectedness between institutions (macroprudential management of systemic risk). In each regard, interim measures have already been taken. Most notably, China’s recent decision to enhance the flexibility of its exchange rate is welcome and its full implementation would contribute to strong, sustainable, and balanced global economic growth. European countries have taken measures to consolidate their fiscal positions and have conducted stress tests on their banks. The oversight board of the Basel Committee has released a broad detailed agreement on new definitions of bank capital and liquidity.  With the macro analysis of tightening standards pointing to large net benefits, the calibration of these proposals will be decided shortly.  Successful implementation of the G-20 financial reform agenda, when combined with the peer review process of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and external reviews by the IMF, should increase actual and perceived systemic stability and thereby reduce incentives for reserve accumulation. This is a necessary condition for a more open, flexible, and resilient international financial system.  The G-20 framework will be buttressed by institutional changes currently underway. The G-20 is now the premier forum for international economic cooperation. IMF governance reforms will further enhance the Fund’s legitimacy and effectiveness. Over time, the FSB has the potential to become the fourth pillar of the Bretton Woods system. Its expertise and broad membership should yield comprehensive and integrated global financial regulations. This will be essential to ensure ongoing cross border flows and to limit regulatory arbitrage and associated leverage.  The final piece of the puzzle is the role of the IMF itself. The crisis exposed enormous strains caused by currency mismatches and large international gross asset positions. These are not best addressed by further building international reserve positions concentrated in the same currencies. It is also unrealistic to rely on the Federal Reserve to act permanently as an international lender of last resort.  The IMF can enhance its role as a contingent supplier of liquidity. In recent weeks, it has made tangible and sensible improvements to its lending programs by refining its Flexible Credit Line, and adopting new a crisis-prevention instrument, the Precautionary Credit Line. However, there are limits to this approach. As with lender of last resort to private entities, there can be moral hazard when lending to sovereigns. Why extend credit to countries that have already bought expensive insurance in the form of foreign-exchange reserves that they do not use? How do you “lend freely against good collateral” at the sovereign level?  Countries can do most of the work themselves. Private currency mismatches can be reduced through effective supervision, and measures to enhance the liquidity of local currency funding markets are essential. Ultimately, sound monetary policy, sustainable fiscal policy, and robust financial supervision and regulation are the best defences against crises and contagion.  Conclusion The world’s economic centre of gravity is shifting. The effectiveness of the international monetary and financial systems will determine how rapidly this change will occur and how sustainable it will be.  
 BIS Review 116/2010 7 The current outlook is for continuation of a modest global recovery, balancing stronger activity in emerging market economies with weaker growth in some advanced economies. However, there are non-negligible risks on the downside. In particular, the current functioning of the international monetary and financial systems is beginning to force a wrenching real adjustment across major economies. Renewed weakness in the United States could have important implications for the Canadian outlook. In this environment, the Bank will have to chart a careful course for Canadian monetary policy.  Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered in light of the unusual uncertainty surrounding the outlook.  A few months ago, the Bank of Canada analysed the potential difference between a co-operative path for the global economy based on the G-20 framework and one in which markets forced fiscal adjustment and little else is changed. We estimated a possible shortfall in global economic output of $7 trillion by 2015 (Chart 5). Since then, the Toronto Summit secured agreement on many of the right measures to make up this shortfall. However, the only measures that have actually been implemented have been consistent with the deflation path. While the other right promises have been made, conviction is required.  Adjusting to the current forces in the global economy requires finishing financial reforms, implementing greater exchange rate flexibility, and putting in place a series of structural policies.  G-20 nations have started, but completing the job will require renewed faith in an open, flexible, and market-based international monetary system.

Ardian Fullani: Brief overview of key topics and the appropriate macroeconomic policy response Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the joint press conference of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission with the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Albania, Tirana, 3 November 2010. *      *      * Dear Mr. Minister, Dear Mr. Bell, Dear media representatives, It is a pleasure for me to appear before you today following a week of intensive and fruitful discussions to present the Bank of Albania’s position. Allow me first to underline that the meetings held broadly confirmed the conclusions provided in our last monetary policy report and the Bank of Albania’s outlook regarding its future performance.  In what follows I will provide a brief overview of our opinions, dwelling upon the key topics of discussion: current and expected economic developments; risks and related concerns, and; the appropriate macroeconomic policy response.  The Albanian economy had a positive performance in the first nine months of 2010, expressed in positive growth rates and improved key parameters of macroeconomic stability. In turn, the recovery has been reflected in contained and downward inflation rates, improved current account deficit, lower budget deficit and relative sustainability of public debt figures. These developments contributed to fully restoring confidence in the banking system, lowering the interest rates and the risk premiums, enhancing the exchange rate sustainability and improving the liquidity and financial sector’s balance sheet indicators. The analysis of economic growth factors suggests that foreign demand for Albanian products and services provided the major contribution, while domestic demand remains dampened and continues to suffer the heightened uncertainty about the future outlook and the tighter lending conditions. Monetary and fiscal policies have been prudent aiming at creating appropriate conditions for a stable economic development. In practical terms, this has materialized in greater orientation of fiscal policy towards the preservation of long-term public debt sustainability. In the meantime, monetary policy has been more stimulating.  As I noted in the presentation of conclusions on the quarterly monetary policy report, this performance is expected to persist in the coming period as well. Macroeconomic stability and the improved banking system’s balance sheets have created the proper preconditions for inducing consumption and investment in economy further.  However, it has to be acknowledged that several important challenges lie ahead for the country’s development. In the short run, the correction of fiscal behaviour requires greater private sector’s contribution to economic growth. This implies a more realistic consumer and business behaviour in their consumption and investment-related decisions, and greater financial support from the banking system. This need becomes even more critical considering the expected performance of foreign demand. The positive tendency of Albanian exports is expected to persist in 2011, but their contribution to economic growth will be more moderate. This performance will call for the generation of domestic forms of aggregate demand, along the same lines as described above. In the long run, the persistence of structural reforms remains a priority for stimulating the economic growth rates.  The Bank of Albania has constantly called for the restructuring of the Albanian economy and the need for a new economic growth model. It should be an export-oriented growth model and it should create a more favourable environment for promoting foreign direct investment BIS Review 175/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 175/2010 at home. Increasing economic growth potential is, among others, a necessity against a background of steady employment growth and lower unemployment figures.  The Bank of Albania has been consistent and transparent about the targeted macroeconomic policy approach. We have requested and welcomed the re-orientation of fiscal policy towards bringing the budget deficit down and keeping the public debt level in check. The successful borrowing via the issuance of Eurobond is a positive signal for the Albanian economy and it will help finance public sector’s activity with foreign currency in the short-run. On the other hand, the quotation of the Albanian sovereign debt in the international markets will require greater commitment in order to maintain appropriate parameters of fiscal sustainability. Pursuing these principles in 2011 budget and in the medium-term public finance framework would be the first right step in this regard.  Keeping inflation under control will continue to guide our monetary policy judgment and decision-making on interest rates and the liquidity conditions in economy. Without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability, we have been and remain firmly committed to providing the possible monetary stimulus to bolster economic growth. Lastly, we are scrutinizing the options of supporting this goal with prudent regulatory measures to be adopted in full concordance with financial stability at home.  
Petar Goshev: Opening of the Joint Public Information Center of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia and the World Bank Address by Mr Petar Goshev, Governor of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia, at the opening of the Joint Public Information Center of the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) and the World Bank, Skopje, 16 December 2010. *      *      * Dear Ms. Lilia Burunchuk, Director of the World Bank Office in Skopje, Dear Mr. Alexander Tieman, IMF Resident Representative for the Republic of Macedonia, Your Excellencies, Dear guests, Dear ladies and gentlemen! Please allow me to greet you and express my pleasure that today we have the opportunity to attend two important events. The first, which we will gladly enjoy for a longer period of time – the official opening of the Joint Public Information Center of the NBRM and the World Bank. And the second, the presentation of the Annual Regional Report of the IMF, an event which is always extremely interesting because it is an analysis made by a high-caliber institution, such as the IMF. Dear guests, The partnership of the Republic of Macedonia and the World Bank lasts for nearly two decades. Good results of this partnership are evident. The partnership by definition rests on the benefit for both parties, i.e. for all who gathered together in achieving a goal. I do not know which of the two sides, benefited more from the cooperation between the World Bank and the Republic of Macedonia. But I strongly believe that the cooperation with the World Bank has played (and still plays) very important financial and advisory role in strengthening the institutional capacities of our country and in boosting the economic development. The amount of capital invested by this institution in the Republic of Macedonia is known, in the years when it was most important to us, when our access to other sources of funds was incredibly difficult and much more expensive. Reforms that were and still are implemented in our country with the assistance of the World Bank are well known: the judiciary, health care, tax system, pension system, decentralization, increasing competitiveness, etc. The positive role of the World Bank in the issues that are extremely important for us is clear, and we call it by the common name – structural reforms, a set of issues without whose advancement we would not have approached the doors of the Euro-Atlantic integrated systems. I think that for that contribution, i.e. the result of our partnership with the World Bank we should use every opportunity to say thank you. Working together on the structural reforms, many of our institutions, members of the administration, and even politicians became acquainted with the best practices in the world in many important areas of the economy, and in general the organization of work, important for improving the quality of life. In fact, the World Bank has always emphasized the importance of knowledge, the necessity of continuous training – a key part of the educated workforce for creating jobs and economic growth. An additional argument are the targeted investments aimed at improving the quality of the educational process in the Republic of Macedonia and taking actions to facilitate the access of Macedonian citizens to the best global expertise. The importance of investment in human BIS Review 175/2010 1 
capital, as economists say, or in the so-called social capital, according to sociologists, is unquestionable. Within that platform, within the slogan – learn continuously to progress continuously, the cooperation between the National Bank and the World Bank has produced a nice event, a good product: logistical support for the process of increasing the knowledge. This logistical support is called: Joint Public Information Center of the NBRM and the World Bank. Today, we are practically announcing its official opening. Its primary function is to promote awareness of the Macedonian public about the work of the World Bank, through the dissemination of information and documentation of the Bank, and to provide access for the Macedonian citizens to extensive collection of contemporary professional literature. In fact, this center is another public information service of the World Bank in Macedonia, along the Depository Library, which operates within the Faculty of Economics, “Ss. Cyril and Methodius” University in Skopje. Located within the NBRM Library, the Center provides access to over 400 publications of the World Bank, electronic access to the World Bank databases, as well as a specifically authorized direct access to the electronic World Bank library, with a possibility to browse over 6,000 copies of professional literature. What makes this Center additionally useful for the public is that, within the cooperation with NBRM, it simultaneously provides the external users with an access also to the National Bank publications, in the form of annual reports and working papers, and to the professional literature that the NBRM Library has at its disposal. The access to all publications, as well as to the World Bank statistical database is open for all interested users in the Republic of Macedonia, because of which this Center can bear the epithet of a rich trove of knowledge, which is waiting to be used. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, We live in an era of extraordinary dynamic changes. An era, where the already learned things outdate in no time, or become insufficient, while the crisis once again showed that the enigmas are far more numerous than the axiomatic truths. That is the reason that the investments in learning should be ongoing.  As a Central Bank, we make constant efforts for knowledge improvement and elevation of the scientific and research capacity, not only within the Bank, but wider, as well. Therefore, in the previous years, we have organized numerous work-shops on many current topics, international conferences, and our employees lecture in several faculties in the country. Also, four years ago, we introduced the Annual Reward for Young Researchers, which has proved to be a very successful example, followed by other institutions, as well.  Today’s opening of the Joint Public Information Centre is another contribution to the upgrade of the scientific and research profile of the Central Bank, which has been established and developed very hard all these years, in parallel with the operational portfolio of the basic functions of NBRM: determining and implementation of the monetary policy, the banking sector supervision, the financial stability support, ensuring smooth functioning of the payment system, and above all, realization of the ultimate objective of the NBRM’s monetary policy – the price stability. I believe that with the opening of this Center, we open another channel for knowledge dissemination, which will be additional stimulus for the scientific and research activity. I believe that the Center will also serve for further deepening of the NBRM and World Bank cooperation, inter alia, also in the domain of organization of forums and debates on various current topics, as well as in the providing of foreign expertise, comparing the domestic with the international experience. Dear friends, We are glad that this library will join the libraries the American journalist Carl T. Rowan calls “knowledge food”, saying also that “the knowledge has liberated much more people than any war made in the entire history”.  2 BIS Review 175/2010 
BIS Review 175/2010 3 We are pleased that also with this Library, we enable a lot of people, either younger or elderly, to give one of the most beautiful gifts – the book, for which the writer Garrison Keillor says that “it is the only gift you can constantly open, again and again”. We are glad that we are opening another such possibility.  I sincerely hope that the opening of this Library will be welcomed by the scholars and wider public in the Republic of Macedonia. Thank you! 
Caleb M Fundanga: The importance of multi-cultural awareness and language learning Opening remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Bank of Zambia and the Chinese International School in Zambia, Lusaka, 22 December 2010. *      *      * The Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to Zambia, H.E Mr. Li Qiangmin The Chairperson – Chinese International School in Zambia, Mr Li Tie The Deputy Governor Administration – Dr Tukiya Kankasa-Mabula The Deputy Governor Operations – Dr Austin Mwape The Principal – Chinese International School in Zambia, Mr. Tan Haitao Distinguished Teachers from the Chinese International School in Zambia Colleagues from the Bank Members of the Press Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen It gives me great delight, on behalf of the Bank of Zambia, to welcome you all to this important signing ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Bank of Zambia and the Chinese International School in Zambia. The MoU that we are about to sign today provides a framework for the provision of Chinese language lessons to members of staff at the Bank of Zambia. Your Excellency, the Bank of Zambia attaches great importance to the need for staff to learn other international languages. In the process of both economic globalization and diversity of culture, language has become more and more important. Multilingualism is important in our world today not only in terms of communicating and advancing in the global economy, but also in order to understand other cultures. It is important because we need to know more about other nations’ cultures and history to improve world relations. In this regard, in October 2004, the Bank entered into an agreement with the Embassy of the Republic of France for the provision of French lessons to members of staff. To date several members of staff have benefited from this programme and can comfortably speak, write and understand the French language. Ladies and Gentlemen, the importance of China on the world economy cannot be overemphasized. With the sustainable development of the Chinese economy and the increasing promotion of the status of China in the world, particularly the China’s access to the World Trade Organization, the successful hosting of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, it is imperative to understand the Chinese language owing to its important role in business and trading. There is therefore a need for people to understand Chinese culture, economy, politics, and the lives of 1.3 billion Chinese people. Furthermore, the rapid growth of the Chinese economy has entailed greater demand for primary commodities like copper. Coupled with this, the demand for manufactured goods from China has increased in a number of countries including Zambia. The level of Chinese investment pouring into the country has also significantly increased while the Chinese community in the country has continued to grow following the rising number of Chinese investments in Zambia. The level of interactions between Zambian businesses and those from China has therefore significantly increased. However, the obvious and notable obstacle to the smooth conduct of business transactions and interactions between the people of our two countries has been the language barrier. Many a time, communication between our people has been through the use of interpreters. BIS Review 175/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 175/2010 Reliance on interpreters can be very inconveniencing, ineffective and costly. This barrier can be overcome by learning the Chinese language. It is against this background that the Bank has taken keen interest in launching this MoU. The principal objectives of the MoU are to:  a) establish a framework in which the Chinese International School can facilitate capacity building in learning the Chinese language among BOZ employees;  b) promote multi-cultural awareness and appreciation of a diversity of languages necessary for Bank staff to transact effectively and efficiently in social and professional fora which require the usage of Chinese; and  c) enhance opportunities for bi-and or multilateral co-operation between the Bank and relevant Chinese-speaking authorities and stakeholders. It is therefore our hope that the MOU we are signing today will assist in not only fostering stronger trade relationships between Zambia and China but to also avail our staff a multi cultural awareness which would assist them both in their official work and in developing their social networks. We also hope that staff will have opportunities for higher education in China and other South East Asian countries where the Chinese language is spoken. Allow me to mention here that, already three bank employees are currently pursuing Phd programmes in China under the Chinese Government scholarship programme. With the introduction of this initiative, it is my hope that more of our staff can be offered scholarships to study in China. In conclusion, let me appeal to the members of staff who will be enrolled on the programme to take the course seriously bearing in mind the resources that the bank is investing into this undertaking. To this effect I urge the human resources department to enrol employees who are committed to learning the language. I also wish to thank the Chinese International School in Zambia for accepting our proposal and we look forward to a further cooperation with other Chinese institutions in order to foster the relations of our two countries. Lastly, I want to thank you, Your Excellency, for finding time to witness this great occasion. I thank you all for your attention. 
Durmuş Yılmaz: Reform strategies and expectations in the new normal – a public perspective Speech by Mr Durmuş Yılmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,  at the Active Academy 8th International Finance Summit, Istanbul, 8 December 2010. *      *      * Distinguished participants and esteemed guests, Before starting my speech, I would like to thank the directors and staff of the Active Academy for their efforts in organizing the 8th International Finance Summit.  The Turkish economy, which has achieved stronger macroeconomic fundamentals and a sound financial system thanks to steadfast implementation of structural reforms since 2001, has been one of the economies that exited the crisis very rapidly. In the upcoming period, the new economic conjuncture needs to be managed wisely in order to sustain macroeconomic stability. Therefore, today I would like to devote my speech entirely to macroeconomic stability. Distinguished participants, The recovery observed in the aftermath of the crisis continues albeit being slow and gradual. However, the downside risks pertaining to the future global growth outlook persist. Vulnerabilities continue especially in developed countries that experience serious deterioration in budget balances and an excessive rise in public debts. Perceptions are growing that the accommodative fiscal policies and expansionary monetary policies adopted by these countries fall short of achieving the desired results in unemployment and growth. Meanwhile, developing countries, which have stronger financial structures, are enjoying a faster recovery process. The decoupling observed between these two groups of countries is expected to continue in the upcoming period as well. Global liquidity has increased significantly as central banks of developed countries, which eased policy rates rapidly, adopted quantitative easing policies. Recently, capital flows to developing countries such as Turkey have been accelerating owing to expectations that short-term interest rates in developed countries would remain low for an extended period, the decoupling in growth performances of countries and increased risk appetite. In the face of growing capital flows, some developing countries are introducing measures to prevent capital inflows. However, past experiences of countries show that restricting capital inflows is not really effective in terms of the volume of capital inflows while it is only partially effective in terms of the type of incoming capital. In other words, due to reasons such as financial innovation and the integration of markets, it is not possible to effectively prevent capital flows, unless they are fully controlled.  The current conjuncture is conducive to benefiting wisely from capital flows and implementing policies that would reinforce financial stability and enhance financial depth. In this respect, the Financial Stability Report, which was prepared by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey and made public yesterday, is an important policy text delineating the strategy to be implemented in the upcoming period to maintain and reinforce financial stability in Turkey. Therefore, I suggest that the report be examined in detail.  The policy framework, which the Report outlines in detail, has four pillars. One of the main pillars of policy implementations in this respect is to encourage economic units to borrow less and to use more equity capital (in other words to have lower leverage ratios). Recent implementations such as increasing required reserve ratios, the termination of remuneration of required reserves, the sustained fiscal discipline in the public sector as underlined in the BIS Review 174/2010 1 
revised Medium-Term Program, the increase in Resource Utilization Support Fund deductions imposed on consumer loans, the introduction of limitations to loan/value ratio in mortgages, the 12-percent target for banks’ capital adequacy ratios are deterring measures against an excessive rise in indebtedness ratios. Secondly, the extension of maturities regarding the borrowings of economic units is encouraged. Under the aegis of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, studies for extension of maturities in public borrowings are being carried out successfully. An important development is that The Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency has permitted the issuance of Turkish lira bonds so as to extend the maturities of liabilities in the banking sector. Additionally, the Central Bank decreased overnight borrowing by 400 basis points last month enabling short-term swap interest rates to go down when required. Besides, the Central Bank aims to encourage long-term deposits with the new arrangements to be made in required reserves. The third pillar of the policy framework is to encourage borrowing in terms of the Turkish currency and to strengthen the net foreign exchange position. To this end, the Undersecretariat of Treasury is oriented towards borrowing in TL; the FX-denominated domestic debt stock was pushed down gradually and Central Bank accelerated reserve accumulation at times of elevated capital inflows, through the flexible foreign exchange buying auctions. Reasons such as implementation of the floating exchange rate regime, the progress made in terms of attaining price stability and the decrease in TL interest rates have facilitated a wider use of Turkish lira in the economy as opposed to foreign currency. Moreover, measures like setting higher required reserve ratios for foreign exchange than those for Turkish lira and not permitting households to use FX-denominated or FX-indexed loans encourage the private sector to borrow in Turkish lira. The foreign exchange net general position arrangement for the banking sector and allowing the issuance of TL bonds by banks in a controlled manner can also be considered in this context. The fourth and last pillar of the policy framework is to promote the risk management concept. In this respect, steps to be taken regarding financial training assume importance for the smooth functioning of the system. We welcome the efforts towards increased recognition of Turkish Derivatives Exchange, more diversified products and more widespread use of forward transactions. In addition, we believe that the floating exchange rate regime that has been in implementation since 2001 has significantly contributed to the embedding of awareness of exchange rate risk.  In short, given the current conjuncture, the avoidance of excessive borrowing both by the public and private sector; preference of longer maturities in all borrowings, opting to borrow in TL as much as possible and managing risks efficiently will considerably strengthen the resilience of Turkish economy against external shocks.  The monetary policy adopted by the Central Bank is composed in a way to make price stability and financial stability complementary. In this context, I would like to evaluate how the CBRT will use policy tools in the upcoming period within the framework of possible scenarios provided in the inflation reports. As also demonstrated on the slide, the current conjuncture supports the CBRT’s stance of keeping policy rates constant for some time, and at low levels for a long period. On the other hand, developments in the aggregate demand composition necessitated that instruments other than the policy rate be brought to pre-crisis levels. In this respect, we have largely completed the exit strategy measures that we announced in April 2010.  2 BIS Review 174/2010 
  In the October Inflation Report, we stated that our baseline scenario was based on an outlook where domestic demand is stronger compared to the previous reporting period, external demand continues to restrain economic activity, and thus aggregate demand conditions continue to support disinflation, albeit to a lesser degree. This baseline scenario assumes a policy framework that the measures outlined in our exit strategy are completed by the end of the year, and that policy rates are kept constant at current levels for some time followed by limited increases starting from the last quarter of 2011, with policy rates staying at single digits throughout the forecast horizon (in other words, 3 years). In this respect, non-interest instruments will be actively used in order to address the risks on financial stability stemming from rapid credit expansion and deterioration in the current account balance. The European Central Bank reluctantly joined the ranks of the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan that have engaged in monetary expansion due to fast-growing debt problems in Europe. As a result, materialization of the first scenario has become more likely, as illustrated in the right-hand part of the chart. In that case, the scenario described in our Inflation Report of October 2009 might come up on the agenda. According to this scenario, on account of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policy on a worldwide scale, coupled with rising risk appetites and the relative improvement of credit risk across emerging markets including Turkey, capital inflows to these countries will continue to hold strong. The low level of resource utilization as well as the strong tendency of cost shocks, which reduce the prices of imported inputs, to reflect upon consumer prices suggests downside risks on inflation in the short term. Materialization of such a scenario could lead to temporarily lower policy rates than envisaged in the baseline scenario and the use of macroprudential instruments in the direction of tightening in order to cut the pace of credit growth in tandem with the temporary rate cuts. The second scenario illustrated in the chart was shared with the public in our Inflation Report of October 2010. Both recent economic developments in Europe and decisions taken BIS Review 174/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 174/2010 by central banks of developed countries increase global economic uncertainty significantly. Should the measures taken at a global level cause long-term and high-rated increases in food and commodity prices, and should such increases lead to a deterioration in the price setting behavior, which in turn, hampers achieving the medium-term inflation targets, an earlier-than envisaged tightening in the baseline scenario would be considered. In this case, as domestic credit expansion would weaken, the use of macroprudential instruments might not be needed in the direction of tightening.  If measures taken in developed countries remain inadequate, the third scenario illustrated in the lower left-hand part of the chart might be considered. In that case, as indicated in the latest Inflation Report, should the global economy face a longer-than-anticipated period of anemic growth, the monetary tightening envisaged to start in the final quarter of 2011 under the baseline scenario might be postponed. Moreover, an outcome, whereby global economic problems intensify and contribute to a contraction of domestic economic activity, may trigger a second round of easing. In this case, the use of macroprudential instruments might not be needed in the direction of tightening, as domestic credit expansion will weaken. Distinguished guests, I would like to underscore once more that as the Central Bank, our primary objective is to achieve and maintain price stability, and that as stipulated by Article 4 of the CBRT Law, we are responsible for “taking precautions for enhancing the stability in the financial system and taking regulatory measures with respect to money and foreign exchange markets”. Therefore, we will continue to act with due diligence in terms of financial stability in the upcoming period as well. However, the Central Bank is not the only entity in charge of financial stability. Other public authorities such as the Ministry of Finance, Undersecretariat of Treasury, Capital Markets Board of Turkey, and primarily the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency, also have significant authority and policy instruments in this regard. It is essential that in the period we are going through, all policy instruments in hand should be deployed in a coordinated manner for the establishment of a sounder and more stable financial structure.  To close my remarks, I would once again like to thank everyone who has contributed to the organization of this event. 
Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile: Farewell party for the 2010 retired staff Speech by Prof Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile, Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the farewell party for the 2010 retired staff, Kampala, 17 December 2010. *      *      * Members of the Board  Deputy Governor  Governor(s) Emeritus  Invited Guests  Retired Staff  Staff present  Ladies and Gentlemen It gives me pleasure once again to host 30 retiring staff for the year 2010 who has diligently served the Bank and our country. I want to acknowledge with gratitude their selfless contribution in the service of the bank.  To have served the Bank until retirement is not a simple matter. We all know that you started service in this Bank when you were many but some of your colleagues fell by the wayside. It is for this reason that we who are still in the Bank, look at you with admiration and gratitude for a job well done. We thank you sincerely for being exemplary. You may be aware that while presiding over the commissioning of the new building for Mbale Bank of Uganda Regional Branch, His Excellency the President stated that Bank of Uganda staff is the most exemplary and professional in Uganda. To this end, I would like to congratulate the entire Bank staff. Bank of Uganda as you are all aware plays a leading role in the exceptional story of reform and development that Uganda has so far experienced.  Distinguished Guests, ladies and gentlemen, Uganda’s banking sector emerged out of the recent financial crisis unscathed and the outlook for the sector is very promising. Credit growth has remained robust, largely on account of improving business conditions and moderating credit risks. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans has been reduced to below 5.0 percent reflecting overall improvements in asset quality. In addition, banks have remained well capitalized with capital well above the regulatory minimum. The sound and stable financial sector has in turn enhanced the effectiveness of the conduct of monetary policy by the Bank of Uganda. The Bank has managed to contain inflation to a stable and single digit level.  Bank of Uganda has also taken the following measures to promote financial inclusion:   Promoted Mobile Money transfer services   Designed a regulatory framework for Tier 4 institutions that includes the regulation of SACCOs   Promoted the development of an effective framework for financial literacy and financial consumer protection   Made proposals to amend the Financial Institutions Act 2004 to provide for Islamic Banking and Finance.  I want to emphasize that within the financial sector, Bank of Uganda with its regulatory mandate will continue to promote financial innovations. Efficient and effective regulation promotes competition, which in turn lead to innovations and lower costs of financial intermediation.  In addition, Bank of Uganda has played and indeed continues to play a major role in the East African Monetary Integration efforts. I believe that you are aware that if we are to survive and BIS Review 174/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 174/2010 be competitive in the current and future international economy, regional economic integration is a must.  I am happy to note that the Bank has been able to excel on the national and regional scene because of our performance in accordance with our strategic plan.  As you join the wide world, I would like to assure you that you will continue to be members of the Bank of Uganda family. I am happy to note that the Bank has improved and will continue to improve post-retirement benefits such as pension and medical services to ensure that you maintain reasonable standard of living.  It is unfortunate that we use the English word retirement because we all know that you are retired, but you are not tired. It is in this context that I wish to advise you that the Bank has provided you knowledge and skills which you can utilize in your transition management to an even better endeavour. Always bear in mind that this so called retirement should not herald your deterioration. It should be a point at which you transition to another prosperous career.  I wish to thank your family members who provided you support while you worked in the Bank. I implore them to continue rendering you support in your transition management.  There is no doubt that you will uphold the good corporate image you have been exhibiting while in the Bank because once a central banker, always a central banker.  Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me at this stage to commend all staff whose performance was outstanding during the recent appraisal period. Let me pay special recognition one of us who participated in a noble cause. This is Augustine Muwonge who cycled around the country in a bid to promote HIV/AIDS awareness in the country. In recognition of this endeavor the Bank presents a token of appreciation to Mr. Augustine Muwonge.  It is now my honour, on behalf of Bank of Uganda, to thank you, once again, for your excellent service and commission you to be good ambassadors of the Bank as you embark on another phase in your development process.  I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy new year.  Thank you. 
Andrew G Haldane: Global imbalances in retrospect and prospect  Speech by Mr Andrew G Haldane, Executive Director, Financial Stability, Bank of England,  at the Global Financial Forum, Chatham House Conference on “The New Global Economic Order”, London, 3 November 2010. *      *      * I am grateful to Charlie Bean, Martin Brooke, Oliver Bush, Richard Davies, Katie Farrant, Samuel Knott, William Speller, Gregory Thwaites, Iain de Weymarn, Tomasz Wieladek, Michelle Wright and Gabriele Zinna for comments and contributions. Global imbalances are colossal. At their high-water mark in 2006, imbalances of the G7 economies totalled around 5% of GDP. Like Colossus, global imbalances straddle many of today’s most important global public policy issues. These include the architecture of the international monetary system, the future of the international trading system and the design of the international financial system. These are high stakes.  This paper assembles some facts from the past on global imbalances. More speculatively, it also assesses some of the factors shaping the course of imbalances in the future. Those medium-term forces suggest that imbalances may get worse before they get better. If so, this global financial fault-line could cause further tremors to the international monetary, trading and financial system in the period ahead, the like of which we are currently experiencing.  Global imbalances – past Global imbalances are a natural by-product of free trade in goods, services and capital. In others words, capital flows are a necessary ingredient of trade and capital liberalisation. In that sense, they are good cholesterol. But capital flows may also demonstrate an imbalance between demand and output in an economy, which must eventually correct if debt and wealth stocks are not to become unsustainable. Sharp corrections in rates of domestic absorption and/or capital flows could then result, with attendant output costs. In that sense, global imbalances may also be bad cholesterol.1 So which are capital flows today? Historical evidence is illuminating. Chart 1 plots (the absolute value of) current account balances in thirteen countries, as a % of GDP, since 1880. Other than in wartime, global imbalances are at their highest in well over a century. They have surpassed levels which prevailed during the classical Gold Standard and are more than twice levels during the Bretton Woods period (Chart 2). For some individual countries, these capital flows look larger still, both absolutely and relative to historical norms (Chart 3). It is not just the size of these global flows that is unusual. So too is their direction. Contrary to theory, capital is flowing from developing countries with a low capital stock, towards developed countries with a high capital stock (Lucas (1990)). In other words, capital is flowing “uphill”, away from countries where the marginal product of capital should be high and towards countries where it should be low. This makes the pattern of global capital flows doubly perplexing.                                                  1  Blanchard and Milesi-Ferretti (2009) discuss the causes of “good” and “bad” imbalances. BIS Review 174/2010 1 
  Perplexing need not mean bad. Current account imbalances are no more than the arithmetic difference between gross capital inflows and outflows. As these gross flows increase as a result of financial liberalisation, it is natural to expect the difference between them to become more volatile (Obstfeld (2010)). As Chart 4 shows, the growth of gross capital flows in the 2 BIS Review 174/2010 
years preceding the crisis was dramatic. At the start of the 1980s, gross capital flows were around 5% of world GDP. By 2007, they had risen to 7 times that. This growth in capital flows and imbalances has been mirrored in the path of the external balance sheets of the major economies. These, too, have adjusted rapidly. In 1985, the US was a net external creditor. By 2009, it had become a net external debtor to the tune of around 20% of GDP. In 1999, China was a net external debtor. By 2008, it had become a net external creditor of around one third of GDP.  An interesting perspective on the drivers of imbalances is provided by looking at the gross saving and investment behaviour of surplus and deficit countries over this period. Chart 5 looks at these patterns. It suggests a couple of striking patterns.  First, the correlation between saving and investment rates appears to have weakened significantly over the past two decades, for both surplus and deficit countries. This is consistent with increasing capital mobility. Historically, there has been a high correlation between national saving and investment rates – the Feldstein-Horioka (1980) puzzle. Chart 6 plots the Felstein-Horioka correlation coefficient alongside an index of financial liberalisation from Obstfeld and Taylor (2004).  Between 1930 and 1980, the Feldstein-Horioka coefficient was close to one – a puzzlingly high co-movement between saving and investment. But that pattern has shifted significantly over the past 30 years. Saving and investment correlations are no longer puzzlingly strong. Indeed, just ahead of crisis, saving/investment correlations had fallen to around zero. They are presently at their lowest levels in almost a century. On the face of it, this might point toward a rather benign interpretation of rising global imbalances: they may simply be the mirror image of rising capital liberalisation. This would be a good cholesterol story.  Even then, however, there may be risks associated with intermediating large global flows of funds. Gross flows can matter. As experience during 2008 illustrated (Chart 4), sharp reversals of these gross flows can disrupt the functioning of financial systems, in particular banking systems reliant on overseas funding. Large inflows may also cause indigestion problems for small domestic capital markets. The strong upward pressures on asset prices in a number of emerging market economies over the past few months are testament to that. As Chart 5 also shows, most of the rise in global flows over the past decade is accounted for by changes in the saving rates of deficit and surplus countries, rather than in their investment rates. In other words, differential savings behaviour has been the prime mover behind rising global imbalances. It is unsurprising, then, that savings behaviour lies at the heart of the current debate among policymakers and academics on the causes of imbalances. This, too, need not be bad news. For example, differential savings may simply be mirroring fundamentals, reflecting differences in rates of time preference among consumers or differential rates of technological progress among companies. Equally, it is possible to conceive of explanations for differential saving which are less well-rooted in fundamentals, such as lax monetary policy in the West or mercantilist trade policy in the East.2 These latter explanations take us closer to a bad cholesterol story for global imbalances.  This is where much of the current debate on global imbalances is centred. Are they the result of surplus countries saving excessively – a “savings glut” explanation (Bernanke (2005))? Or is it instead the deficit countries saving too little – a “savings shortage” explanation (Taylor (2007)). Put differently, is the problem impatience in the West or excessive patience in the East?                                                  2  This can lead to a global co-ordination (or adding-up) problem, as countries seek individually to each run a current account surplus, so depressing global demand (King (2010)). BIS Review 174/2010 3 
 Global imbalances – present  To begin to answer those questions, consider recent saving behaviour in two archetypical surplus and deficit countries – China and the US. Chart 7 looks at the respective contributions of China and the US to global savings since 1980. In 1980, the US contributed around a quarter of global saving. Today, it contributes around a tenth. China has been the mirror image. Having contributed less than 5% in 1980, today China is the single largest source of global saving, contributing around one fifth. It has been argued by some that these trends could simply reflect different cultural attitudes towards saving among US and Chinese citizens. In the US, it is often said that there is a culture of spending rather than saving – neurologically, the impatience gene may be dominant (Haldane (2010)). In China, by contrast, the culture may be biased towards saving rather than spending, with the patience gene dominant. In other words, differences in  agents’ rate of time preference, or degree of patience, might account for savings imbalances (Buiter (1981)).  4 BIS Review 174/2010 
  But a recent survey of time preferences in 45 countries suggests cultural differences are not the full story (Wang, Rieger and Hens (2010)). Asked to choose between a payoff this month and a larger payoff next month, 68% of US students choose to wait; they exhibit patience. Facing the same trade-off, 62% of Chinese students made the same choice. These differences are small.3 They are also the “wrong way around” to explain imbalances. So if cultural factors are not the explanation, what is? Charts 8 and 9 plot national saving rates in China and the US, broken down on a sectoral basis. There are striking differences in saving behaviour across the government, household and corporate sectors in the two countries.  Around two-thirds of the rise in Chinese savings since the early 1990s derives from the corporate sector.4 This reflects two things. First, rapidly rising corporate profitability, against a backdrop of strong growth and rising productivity (Ma and Yi (2010)). Since 2000, profits among Chinese industrial companies have risen around 30% per year.  Second, more significantly still, most of these profits have been retained within Chinese companies rather than distributed to shareholders (Qiao and Song (2009)). These differences in US/Chinese corporate savings behaviour show up dramatically in dividend payouts. The average dividend payout ratio among US corporations in 2009 was 40%, with less than a quarter of companies failing to pay a dividend. The average dividend payout ratio among listed Chinese corporations in 2009 was around 18%. Among these, more than half paid no dividend whatsoever.                                                   3  Among the 45 countries, Germany ranked as the most patient (almost 90% of students waited), Nigeria the least patient (less than 10%). 4  Using firm-level data, Bayoumi, Tong and Wei (2010) argue that Chinese listed firms’ corporate savings rates are neither especially high compared to listed firms in other countries and the gross savings rate for a typical listed Chinese firm has declined, albeit insignificantly, between 2002–2007. BIS Review 174/2010 5 
Charts 10 and 11 consider the distribution of changes in dividend payout ratios among global and Chinese companies. Among global companies, payout ratios rarely fall. More than half of the time they increase. Impatient investors demand immediate dividend gratification,  leading to large and rising distributions. This dividend ratchet is a puzzle in empirical finance (Black (1976)). If anything, it is one which is growing over time.  The payout pattern among Chinese quoted firms could not be more different. Increases and decreases in payout ratios are roughly evenly split. The high proportion of “unchanged” payout ratios simply reflects the zero payout policy of more than half of quoted Chinese companies. There is no distribution ratchet. Profits are largely ploughed back. In this respect, Chinese payout behaviour today is not dissimilar to that among US companies during its rapid growth phase in the 19th century (Chart 12). There is more than one explanation for this behaviour among Chinese firms. A benign interpretation is that it reflects the high option value of Chinese companies retaining funds given future growth prospects, as with US firms in the 19th century. A less benign interpretation is that it reflects an absence of external sources of company finance and shortfalls in corporate governance, with insufficient discipline on companies by outside investors. In practice, both factors are likely to have been important over recent years. Turning to US and Chinese households, during this century household gross saving as a fraction of GDP has averaged less than 5% in the US. In China, it has averaged around 20%. In China, the constancy in high household saving rates masks two striking, but broadly offsetting, factors: a 10 percentage point fall in household’s income share; and a 10 percentage point rise in household’s saving propensity (Ma and Yi (2010)). Much of the rise in saving propensities appears to be precautionary. Facing “three mountains” in the future – education, pensions and health care – Chinese consumers have taken the high (saving) road.  In the US, the fall in the household financial balance correlates strongly with the path of household net worth (McKelvey (2010), Chart 13). This correlation emerged strongly during the 1980s, with the simultaneous rise in net wealth and fall in saving. This correlation has remained strong as net worth has reversed recently due to falling house and equity prices.  What lies behind these movements? Lax monetary policy has been suggested by some (Taylor (2007)). Financial liberalisation is a second plausible candidate. This had the effect of loosening constraints on the supply of housing credit and thereby boosting housing demand and prices in the US. It also enabled households to mobilise and withdraw the accrued equity in their property to finance spending. Estimates of housing equity withdrawal for spending rose from under 2% of personal disposable income in 2000 to around 4% at the peak in 2005 (Greenspan and Kennedy (2007), Chart 14).  Micro-level data support this story. They show that home equity withdrawal was driven primarily by households with low credit scores and high credit card utilisation rates, who are most likely to have been credit-constrained in the past (Mian and Sufi (2009)). As these constraints loosened, spending rose and saving fell. Liberalisation fed impatience.  These patterns are also consistent with an inequality-based explanation for lower saving (Rajan (2010)). Rising inequality may generate an increased desire to “keep up with the Jones’s”. That, in turn, may have led to higher borrowing, and lower net saving, by the poor.  And what applies within countries appears also to apply across them. Among advanced countries, there is a significant negative relationship between within-country measures of inequality and the current account position (Chart 15). Rising inequality, by lowering savings rates among the poor, appears to be deficit-inducing. Rising imbalances may have important social, as well as economic, roots.  6 BIS Review 174/2010

Global imbalances – future So what will be the key forces driving global imbalances in the period ahead? Judging from the recent past, two factors have been important:   Global financial integration;   Differential savings behaviour.  Consider in turn their likely evolution.  Global financial integration. In the period ahead, this will be shaped by a number of medium-term structural factors. One key such factor is cross-country GDP convergence. Over time, we would expect countries’ income levels to converge, as currently low income countries catch-up with their high income trading neighbours (Solow (1956)). This convergence process is a well-established empirical phenomenon (Barro (1991) and Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)).  Accompanying this GDP convergence is likely to be catch-up in gross external balance sheet positions. As countries develop, so too does their integration into global capital markets, with higher levels of gross external assets and liabilities. Cross-country evidence bears this out. There is a well-defined empirical relationship between a country’s GDP per head and its gross external balance sheet position (Chart 16).     BIS Review 174/2010 9 
Taken together, these two factors imply a pattern of steadily rising gross capital flows over time, with growth strongest among countries catching up with their high-income trading neighbours. It is possible to calibrate these integration trends and project them forward to simulate future external balance sheets positions among the major economies.  These simulations take as initial conditions cross-country GDP per capita, projected forward using a calibrated rate of growth convergence drawn from previous empirical studies and adjusted for known future changes in population growth. This gives a set of cross-country projections for GDP per capita. These are then translated into gross external balance sheet positions using historical relationships with per capita GDP.  Chart 17 plots some projections of (the average of) gross external assets and liabilities relative to GDP for the G7 countries, China, India, Brazil and Russia. These projections go out to 2050. Among the G7 economies, external balance sheet ratios are broadly flat at around twice nominal GDP. This flatness is driven in large part by assumption, as it is assumed the highest-income countries maintain a flat ratio of external assets to GDP.  This is almost certainly too extreme an assumption. Although smaller than in the past, there remain strong home biases in the investment portfolios of developed countries’ institutional investors (Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) and IMF (2010)). As liberalisation progresses, these biases would be expected to unwind, boosting gross external assets in relation to GDP in developed countries. For that reason, the calibration here can be thought of as a limiting case of the likely adjustments in the pattern of global capital flows.  Subject to that important caveat, the growth in the non-G7 economies’ contribution to global capital markets is still striking. Among the BRICs, external balance sheets as a fraction of GDP exceed G7 levels by around 2035. By 2050, they are around 2.5 times nominal GDP. These patterns are even more striking when expressed as a share of global external assets. By 2050, over half of all G20 external assets are associated with the BRICs, up from around 9% currently (Chart 18). Among the non-G7, non-BRIC G20 countries, their share trebles from 5% to around 15%.  Within this, some countries’ share of global assets sky-rocket. China’s share of global finance rises to around 30% by 2050, roughly that of the entire G7. India rises to almost 20%, from less than 0.5% currently (Chart 19). The US share falls from 28% to around 12%.  The flow counterpart to these external stock positions is no less dramatic (Chart 20). By 2020, gross capital flows of the non-G7 countries are projected to exceed those of the G7 economies. By 2030, non-G7 flows are more than three times G7 flows. And by 2040, they are almost four times G7 flows.  Even if these calibrations represent an extreme case, they are indicative of a striking power shift in the pattern of global financial flows. If this path were to be even broadly followed, it would have implications for the scale of global imbalances, which will tend to rise as gross capital flows outpace GDP growth. It would have implications for financial stability, as the scale of gross capital surges (fuelling bubbles) and reversals (fuelling crises) increases. And it may also have implications for the dollar’s reserve currency status. Differential savings behaviour. Consider next the possible future path of savings behaviour across the world’s major economies. There are likely to be many factors affecting cross-country saving rates in the period ahead. Predicting these is fraught with uncertainty. But one key medium-term determinant of saving is demographics (Wilson and Ahmed (2010)). And demographic trends are something about which there is little uncertainty in the period ahead.   10 BIS Review 174/2010 
    BIS Review 174/2010 11 
Chart 21 looks at projected changes in the fraction of adults in the age range 40 to 59 in developed and emerging countries – the “prime savings” cohort. It suggests a sharp bifurcation in demographic trends in developed and emerging economies. Among advanced countries, an ageing population results in a decline in the middle-aged share, from a peak today of almost 30% to around 25% by 2050. For developing economies the reverse is true, with a continuing rise in the fraction of middle-aged individuals from 20% today to around 25% by 2050.  Cross-country correlations suggest a relationship between this prime-saving cohort and saving behaviour. Chart 22 suggest that every 1 percentage point rise in the middle-aged population share raises the national savings rate by around 1.75 percentage points.5 Taken together with emerging population trends, this suggests some potentially important life-cycle pressures on the global pattern of savings in the period ahead.    To bring these pressures to life, Chart 23 projects saving rates in a selection of countries out to 2050 based on population and GDP projections. This is plainly a gross over-simplification. These projections take no account of a whole host of other factors that may push in the other direction, including later retirement dates which may boost saving in countries with an ageing population, and falls in saving rates in emerging countries as the social safety net is widened.  But based on demographic and convergence trends alone, saving rates in the BRICS, already high, are projected to continue their ascent. For example, in India they lead to an increase in saving of around 10 percentage points of GDP, raising the saving ratio to 50% by 2050, as demographics push a larger fraction of the population into the high savings cohort. Among developed countries, meanwhile, these trends are reversed with further demography-induced falls in savings rates.                                                  5  See also the evidence in Wilson and Ahmed (2010). 12 BIS Review 174/2010 
  Given the rising income share of the BRIC countries, these patterns are even more dramatic when we consider country shares of future global savings. China rises to represent around 40% of global savings by 2050. Over the same period, the US share of global savings continues its descent, stabilising at around 5%.  On the face of it, these partial equilibrium projections of future savings rates suggest that medium-term pressures on global imbalances could intensify, with saving rates rising among surplus countries and falling in deficit countries. To bring this intuition to life, assume for simplicity’s sake that investment rates as a fraction of GDP remain fixed at 2010 levels across countries, but that saving rates evolve as in Chart 23. The result would be a trebling of global imbalances from current elevated levels over the next twenty years.  Of course, these projections only look at the marginal impact on imbalances of medium-term demographic and GDP trends. They take no account of a host of other factors that may defuse pressures on imbalances, including adjustments in real exchange rates, lower investment ratios as the marginal product of capital reduces in emerging markets and falls in saving rates in emerging markets as the social safety net is widened and deepened. These offsetting factors will need to be very significant, however, if they are to counterbalance medium-term upward pressures on global imbalances from demographics and convergence.  Conclusion  So where does this leave us? With a potentially dramatic change in the future international financial landscape. With a potentially decisive shift in the pattern of global capital flows. With potential pressures for a further widening in global imbalances. And, if so, with a likely intensification of pressures on international monetary, financial and trading systems. The impetus to reform these global systems is strong today. It may be stronger still tomorrow. BIS Review 174/2010 13

Thomas Jordan: Macroprudential instruments and balance sheet risks Introductory remarks by Mr Thomas Jordan, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 16 December 2010. *      *      * In my following remarks, I will address two issues in depth. I will start by detailing the set of instruments which the Swiss National Bank (SNB) should have at its disposal for the prevention of financial crises. I will then take a look at the risks on our balance sheet. Macroprudential instruments at the SNB More than three years have passed since the outbreak of the international financial crisis. The crisis made two things very clear. First, the capital and liquidity buffers in the financial system were far too low. Second, systemic risks had been grossly underestimated prior to the crisis or had not even been identified. Almost nobody suspected that the risks were so closely interlinked, nor that problems in a small segment of the US mortgage market could rock the global financial system and the world economy. In order to make the financial system more resilient, one thing that needs to be done is to strengthen the capital and liquidity buffers. Significant progress has already been made in this regard with the approval of Basel III and the new “too big to fail” (TBTF) regulations. These measures should help ease the problems in connection with the TBTF issue significantly. But there will be other crises in the future, too. That is why it is equally important to identify the build-up of risks in the financial system at an early stage and to take countercyclical measures to mitigate them. It is in this area – referred to as macroprudential policy – where there are still major deficiencies. The National Bank has the statutory mandate to contribute to the stability of the financial system. In its function as lender of last resort, the SNB plays a key role in managing financial crises. It can provide emergency liquidity assistance to a bank that runs into difficulties, thus preventing the negative impact the bank’s default could have on both the banking sector and the economy. This remedial measure proved highly effective during the crisis. However, emergency liquidity assistance should only be provided in exceptional cases, as it creates false incentives for banks and entails considerable financial risks for the SNB. In order for the National Bank to fulfil its mandate, it is imperative that it also be able to take more preventative action in the future. This is the only way the SNB can guard effectively against future crises. Preventative action is only possible if the National Bank has efficient and effective instruments at its disposal. However, there is currently a glaring deficiency in this area. Up until now, the only precautionary measure the SNB could employ was to issue a warning. Yet experience has shown that warnings alone are not enough. Before the crisis, the National Bank had repeatedly drawn attention to the high leverage of the big banks and warned that their ability to absorb losses was not adequate. These caveats did not result in any voluntary change in behaviour. For this reason, it is essential that our set of preventative instruments for financial stability be improved in three areas; namely, improved access to information, closer involvement in regulatory procedures with regard to financial stability issues, and direct macroprudential decision-making powers. I would now like to take a closer look at these. First, it is crucial that we have all the necessary information quickly to hand in order to identify the build-up of risks in the financial system at an early stage. While the SNB’s statutory authority to compile statistical data is both necessary and helpful, the latest crisis clearly demonstrated that the National Bank must be able to request additional information. With this I mean, for example, quantitative, non-standardised data on banks’ risk exposure. BIS Review 173/2010 1 
Unlike FINMA, Switzerland’s financial market supervisory authority, the SNB’s stance is primarily a macroeconomic or systemic one. This is why we must be able to act independently in certain situations when gathering information. At the same time, we also want to keep our access to information to an absolute minimum and avoid a duplication of activities with FINMA. Second, clarification of the SNB’s participation rights and obligations is needed in the area of regulation essential for financial stability. In order to give appropriate consideration to financial stability aspects, we feel that the SNB should be involved in regulatory procedures at an early stage. In other words, in the conceptual phase. The authorities responsible for issuing financial market regulations should, therefore, be obliged to consult with the SNB early on in the process. Thirdly, the National Bank must have clearly defined decision-making powers with regard to regulations that either bear direct relation to monetary policy or to emergency liquidity assistance. I would like to take two current regulatory proposals to explain more clearly what I mean: the countercyclical capital buffer and the implementation of the TBTF regulations. The countercyclical capital buffer represents a capital requirement that can be adjusted over time. This buffer will be introduced within the framework of Basel III and has the important tasks of protecting the banking sector from the risks posed by excessive lending and of curbing the banking sector’s procyclical behaviour. In the event of excessive growth in lending, the capital requirement can be increased; then when growth in lending is weak, it can be lowered again or even reduced to zero. The countercyclical capital buffer thus has a direct impact on banks’ lending activities and can, as a result, strengthen or weaken the effect of the SNB’s monetary policy significantly. Therefore, whoever determines the level of this buffer also influences the effect of monetary policy. It is for this reason that – in our opinion – the responsibility for the countercyclical capital buffer for domestic lending must lie with the SNB. The National Bank must be able to decide when the buffer is activated and how high it should be. It goes without saying that it would do so within legally defined limits. The same should also apply to the activation of loan-to-value ratios and affordability criteria for mortgage loans. All of these instruments are closely linked to monetary policy. Within the context of the implementation of the TBTF regulations, the systemically important banks will have to be determined. This is because the more rigorous capital and liquidity requirements are only intended for these banks. And because emergency liquidity assistance is also reserved for systemically important banks, the decision as to the systemic importance of a bank has a direct impact on the SNB in its function as lender of last resort. These decision-making powers, too, must therefore be placed in the National Bank’s hands. This proposed solution should give the SNB the formal responsibilities it needs in order to fulfil its mandate in the area of financial stability in a preventative manner. In many countries, a transfer of banking supervision to the central bank is currently the subject of intensive discussion. In contrast, the National Bank is by no means calling into question the separation of banking supervision and central bank activities with the solution presented here. This separation has worked for Switzerland. The aim is not to infringe on FINMA’s jurisdiction. Instead, FINMA and the SNB need to clearly define how the new responsibilities and tasks arising from the urgent need for more rigorous analysis and regulation of systemic risk should be divided between them. At this point, I also want to stress that this macroprudential task does not call into question the SNB’s primary mandate, which is the maintenance of price stability. Instead, it supports the long-term fulfilment of this mandate. The SNB has also expressed its opinion – along the lines of this proposal – on the recommendations made by the business audit commissions of the National Council and the Council of States in their report on the financial crisis. 2 BIS Review 173/2010 
SNB balance sheet risks In my following remarks, I would like to look at the SNB’s balance sheet risks. As the Chairman of the Governing Board, Philipp Hildebrand, has already mentioned, it was primarily the large-scale purchases of foreign currency that contributed to the expansion of our balance sheet to its current level of approximately CHF 280 billion. Of this amount, CHF 260 billion is made up of currency reserves, which comprise not only foreign exchange, but also gold and the IMF’s special drawing rights. If we add to that the SNB’s loan to the stabilisation fund, over 95% of our assets are denominated in foreign currency. Not only is the balance sheet longer as a result, it also carries more risk. Without doubt, the exchange rate risk is now our most significant risk. While fluctuations in annual earnings running into the billions have also occurred in the past, they are likely to be even more pronounced in the future owing to the greater size of the balance sheet. In this context, I would like to point out two factors in particular. First, experience has shown that losses on foreign currency positions decline over time. On the one hand, strong currency fluctuations are often followed by corrections, since markets tend to overreact, while on the other, interest and dividend payments help to reduce losses on foreign currency investments. Second, the SNB has, for a long time now, placed a great deal of value on a robust balance sheet. Established mechanisms for the steady build-up of provisions and smoothing of profit distribution have helped build up an equity capital buffer over the years, and this makes it possible for us to carry losses. Owing largely to this foresighted approach, the level of equity capital on our balance sheet is, by international standards, still above average, in spite of its current size. A gratifying reduction in the balance sheet risk was achieved in 2010 for the stabilisation fund. Given that the market situation improved considerably this year, holdings of some USD 3 billion were sold and a number of derivative positions were closed. In addition, interest payments and repayments on investments amounted to approximately USD 3 billion. Overall, the SNB’s loan to the StabFund at the end of November 2010 was down to just roughly USD 13 billion, compared to almost USD 20 billion at the end of 2009. At the same time, the overall risk for the SNB decreased from USD 24 billion to USD 16 billion. This USD 16 billion corresponds to the maximum possible loan. This upper limit exceeds the current loan, since part of the StabFund’s portfolio does not require any financing at present. Owing to the continued favourable market situation in the fourth quarter, the value of the fund’s assets is now considerably higher than the value of the loan. The risk of the SNB suffering a loss upon liquidating the fund has thus decreased further. As long as we have to maintain high levels of foreign exchange reserves for monetary policy reasons, the currency risks in our balance sheet will not be easy to reduce. We have, however, taken two measures in an effort to strengthen our balance sheet further. First, we decided back in 2009 to double the annual allocation to provisions over the course of five years. Second, in recent months, we have reduced risk concentrations in currency holdings and borrower categories – which arose from the interventions – through diversification. My colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will discuss this in greater depth. As previously mentioned, the higher level of risk will be evidenced by greater fluctuations in the SNB’s annual earnings. It is too early to say whether this will eventually affect the distribution of profit to the Confederation and the cantons. There is no need for action at this stage. The profit distribution agreement between the Federal Department of Finance and the SNB sets out clearly defined threshold values for a review. The current agreement – which runs until the end of 2017 – will be reviewed at the latest with regard to the distribution for the 2013 financial year. Should the distribution reserve, which has been built up over the last few years, be depleted before then, the agreement calls for an immediate review. BIS Review 173/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 173/2010 It is currently too early to say anything definite about the outcome of the review. Seen from the current perspective, it would come as no surprise, however, if the annual distribution had to be reduced somewhat. We have repeatedly emphasised that an annual distribution of CHF 2.5 billion cannot be guaranteed in the long term. 
Ardian Fullani: Macrofinancial stability in EU candidate countries and potential candidate countries – lessons to be learned Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the High-level Policy Workshop on Macro-prudential Policy, Frankfurt am Main, 14 December 2010. *      *      * Dear colleagues, It is a pleasure to discuss with you our experience with the crisis and share some thoughts on the relevant lessons for the future. My perspective on this issue will focus on the case of Albania; an emerging market economy which imported the crisis through financial market channels and interconnectedness. The challenges posed to eastern European economies and decision makers were mostly the same in nature, while their policy response differed according to economic structures, institutional differences and degrees of freedom enjoyed by them. Let me briefly preview the three main messages of my speech. The first one is that there is no conflict between price stability and financial system stability in the long run – instead, they do mutually re-enforce each other and the resilience of the economy to external and internal shocks. From a central bank’s point of view, a corollary to this is that any macro-prudential measure taken to enhance financial stability is an investment in medium and long term price stability. I believe this conclusion is amply borne from Albania’s recent experience. My second message is that global or even regional financial markets require global or at least regional supervision and crisis resolution mechanisms. Just as problems originating on a particular sector of the economy can escalate into general macroeconomic imbalances, so financial market imbalances in one financial institution or one country can disrupt other financial institutions or countries. Collaboration between home-host supervisors is therefore a must, but I would argue that probably more can be done in this regard. My third message concerns the role of anchors in the design and implementation of macro-prudential policies. Monetary policy is made credible from the clear focus on a transparent measure of price stability (CPI inflation) which in turn increases the accountability of the central bank pursuing it and ultimately its operational flexibility. Financial stability is inherently a more difficult concept, even on a theoretical level, but I think more should be done to quantify the term and unify its understanding. This would allow for more transparent communication and increased public support for the central bank’s action. I will now expand on these issues. 1. Price stability and macro-prudential measures A panoramic glance at the experience of central and eastern European economies with the latest crisis would indicate a broad range of outcomes. While this might look normal at first view, it is worth remembering that CEE countries share quite a few commonalities in their economic and financial structures. Furthermore, they were hit by the same type of external shock, at exactly the same time. One has thus a fair approximation of a controlled experiment on the role of macroeconomic policies before and during the crisis. At the risk of generalizing too much, I would say that CEE economies shared broadly the same development model and problems. We benefited from large capital inflows mainly in the form of FDI, remittances and cross-border loans. Western European banks penetrated our financial system, increasing financial intermediation and facilitating capital inflows. This BIS Review 173/2010 1 
process resulted in fast credit and economic growth based on a consumption lead model. While inflation has been generally under control financial imbalances and vulnerabilities were increasing, in the form of rapid growth in real estate prices and balance sheet exposures in liquidity and foreign currencies. Our economies were hit by the crisis since the first week of October 2008. The fear of contagion was enhanced further by a sharp decrease in the market value of the EU banking groups that operate in the region. It affected negatively the public trust in the system, resulting in widespread deposits withdrawals. Later, as the financial crisis progressed and transformed into a global economic recession, the effects extended to real economy and exchange rate depreciation. Most of the countries in the region faced a rapid liquidity shortage caused by the deposits run, lower remittances and FDI outflows. The balance sheets across the region suffered from both liquidity problems and exchange rate depreciation. This was negatively reflected in consumption and investment, which further deteriorated the financial stability outlook with the possibility of a balance sheet deflation and economic contraction mutually supporting each other in a vicious spiral. The ability of our economies to absorb these shocks was however different. The natural instinct of macroeconomic policies facing such a contraction scenario is to engage in countercyclical measures in the form of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. However, the very presence of financial stability concerns in the equation significantly changed the equation. We can safely argue that countries which experienced the least macroeconomic and financial imbalances were the ones better placed to pursue countercyclical policies and in fact the ones which emerged the fastest from the effects of the crisis. I believe Albania is such a country:  We had no bank failures or public injections of capital;  We did contain and reverse the confidence crisis in the financial system and its adverse effects. In fact, we did not experience financial disintermediation;  We did continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace;  We did manage to keep inflation expectations anchored. Therefore, I will share with you our thoughts and measures throughout this period. To conclude this topic I will briefly summarize my personal lessons from this crisis. Before the crisis, Bank of Albania was concerned for the possible financial threats that were being accumulated during the years of fast financial intermediation. To illustrate the point: most of the credit growth went in the non-tradable sector, with services and construction accounting for most of the expansion. At the same time, more than 70 percent of total credit was in foreign currency with EURO making the biggest share of the outstanding stock. The tune of that period was the same in the entire region. The overall impression that the financial innovations had reduced the risk and the abundant global liquidity created a very optimistic picture. Despite some truth in this, the pace at which financial intermediation grew annually was frenetically high. In particular there were two main aspects of financial intermediation that were particularly troubling in my opinion. First, economic agents created financial excesses using mostly the financial system. While meeting their needs, the financial system aligns and matches agents’ positions according to length of maturity and liquidity. This holds true under the assumption that all claims and obligation will be fulfilled in timely manner in the same order. Otherwise if they violate this assumption and end up overlapping each other than financial system might become unstable. Our concern was that too many gaps were opening to fast and the Albanian economy seemed to experience some sort of what latter came to be named as risk-taking channel. Second, there appeared to be a general mispricing of risks from the banking sector. High concentration in particular sectors or clients indicated undue risk analysis or risk management from banks, while lending to  2 BIS Review 173/2010 
un-hedged borrowers in a flexible exchange rate regime seemed to be a potential moral hazard issue. We addressed the first issue through increasing information sharing and facilitating the dialogue between the monetary policy and the financial stability and supervision of the Bank. Normally, the foresight of monetary policy is from the trough to the pick of the business cycle because it is mandated with smoothing the fluctuation in economy or prices. However, the duration of financial gaps and excesses might be very different and usually much longer. Therefore monetary policy by design has the potential to forget about financial stability; therefore we were potentially missing important information regarding the effects that decision making on monetary policy could have on the sustainability of agent’s budgets. That is why I believe was important to have guardians of financial stability in the monetary policy decision making process. With this reasoning we have brought the director of supervision and the director of financial stability in the monetary policy advisory committee. In this respect our monetary policy did not focus only in the discussion of macro effects but also in the discussion of the micro effects of decision making. This resulted in policy coordination within the central bank. I believe that this is the first line of defense that we had in our philosophy. This helped us to strike the correct balance between all policies. The second issue was addressed through tightening macro-prudential regulations and policies and strengthening the on-site supervision of banks. Through regulatory and supervisory interventions, we aimed to improve the commercial bank’s governance and their transparency, to strengthen their risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, to improve the capital adequacy and liquidity ratios, as well as to reduce the exposure to credit risk stemming from un-hedged borrowers in foreign currency or predatory practices from commercial banks. On the same line, our policy response during the crisis was cautious, prioritizing financial stability and the preservation of inflation expectations to outright economic stimulus. By the beginning of the first quarter of 2009, financial panic, liquidity problems especially in foreign currency, slowdown in EU economic area and the financial stress in the EU banking system affected both the real and the financial sectors of Albanian economy. Credit slowed down considerably, exchange rate started to depreciate, and forecasts for economic growth and inflation were down. In the mean time deposit withdrawals continued and liquidity concerns become more prominent.  Bank of Albania provided ample liquidity in domestic currency in the interbank market while tightening its supervision on banks and increasing the collaboration with their home supervisors. A specific feature that needs to be mentioned is the timely increase of the deposit insurance scheme. This move marked a turning point in the confidence crisis of the public to the banking system and the liquidity problems of the system. From a narrow perspective centered on its main objective of price stability, the focus of monetary policy would be an expansionary action. However, considerations of the external balances of our economy, its financial stability and the need to anchor expectations, constrained our decisions. I will elaborate briefly on these factors. Faced with contained upward pressures in inflation, the central bank focused its attention on determinant factors of financial stability. By refraining from pursuing an expansionary monetary policy, the central bank did not exacerbate the pressures on the exchange rate which would than put additional strain on un-hedged borrowers and the bank’s balance sheets. Furthermore, interest rate cuts had the potential to affect deposit withdrawals and cause liquidity problems and further depreciation. At the time these two were the main concerns to financial stability. The Albanian economy did however receive some macroeconomic stimulus in the form of fiscal expansion. This countercyclical policy was made possible because of the previous work done to consolidate the fiscal position and to anchor macroeconomic policies and public expectations. Albania approached the crisis with sustainable fiscal position in terms of deficit and public debt, creating room for maneuver and fiscal expansion to support economy before BIS Review 173/2010 3 
monetary policy could intervene. Therefore the first lesson from the crisis for authorities would be to follow countercyclical policies, which will permit for bolder action in time of crisis.  What are the lessons for the future? I think I already mentioned the first one. The second lesson, which relates to the price and financial stability, is equally important. Price and financial stability do not conflict each other in the long run. Central bankers should never forget that fiat money on which we base our way of life and prosperity, is a social contract, based on the society’s trust that every bill will be honored by the creator of that money, which in most of the cases is the central bank. This trust is one of the important pillars that guaranty not only the economic system but the entire society. In my opinion, even in the short run, the central banks are well equipped to pursue these two goals with the instruments at their disposal: main policy rate on refinancing operation; macro-prudential policies on a systemic level; and, careful and diligent micro supervision of commercial banks. Having two goals and at least two instruments should allow for an optimal mix of policies, at least in theory. In practice, as is indicated from our experience, central banks should not shy to lean against the wing in order to discourage or at least contain financial imbalances. Furthermore, every time we face fundamental economic problems with potentially negative systemic implications, we revert to financial stability. I firmly believe that the first and most important job for a central bank is to ensure the integrity of money and the banking system. 2. Joint supervision and crisis response mechanisms Building bridges of continuous communication with local bank managers, home supervisors and headquarters of the mother institutions has proved to be critical in dealing with the problems before they get out of hand. While communication is an advice that is frequently used, we made a good use of that beyond mere courtesy. We acknowledged that financial development was following a certain pattern. Financial institutions like all other businesses adopt marketing strategies and stick to such strategies in all markets. What this means for us is that once new product are developed and tested in other markets, they will follow the same pattern of marketing in other markets as well. In the years that preceded the crisis, financial institutions started the practice of lending in exotic currencies, offering very low interest rates and being without any economic relation with the borrower activity. Being aware of these developments, from previous communication with other central banks in the region, we were alerted to spot the first sign of such behavior in our economy. Therefore at the first signs of such credits, we discussed with the management of our banks and stopped administratively lending in these currencies for all un-hedged borrowers. On a systemic level, I do believe the recent experience highlighted some issues that need to be looked more carefully in the future. I will highlight here only three of them.  The policies that facilitated the capital inflows into economies of the region were not followed by actions which could have provided the needed liquidity when these flows reversed or stopped. Countries of the region did not benefit from the swap agreements or similar arrangements that would allow us access to short term liquidity. One can certainly say that in normal times that could be resolved at group level. However, this didn’t necessarily prove to be the case in the recent experience. Because our financial systems are inter-connected, I think this issue deserves more attention in the future.  A crucial step in alleviating the financial crisis in CEE countries was the Vienna initiative, which stabilized both the balance sheets of the big banking groups operating in the region and the trust of our public in them. I think such a facility needs to be permanent, at least in the case of global or European potential financial 4 BIS Review 173/2010 
 Financial regulation and regulatory arbitrage was a serious issue before and throughout the crisis. Before the crisis, banking groups would play regulatory regime and policies against each other and try to reach some kind of lowest common denominator throughout the region. Countless times we have heard the complaint “Why are you not allowing this, your neighbors do!”, and I’m sure others people in this room have heard it too. During the crisis, we experienced several cases of countries trying to seek individual solutions to common problems. While fully respecting the idiosyncrasies and different timing priorities of each country, I think we would all benefit from a more collegial approach to regulation.  On a national level, I believe the stress should be on supervision of Systemically Important Financial Institutions, with the right care not to create wrong perceptions related with moral hazard. In our region, these institutions are typically banks. In my view, these banks should become subject of a more stringent regulatory framework, in terms of capital and liquidity requirements, business and risk profile, including contingency plans. The supervisory authority should always be prepared for the worse and make sure that crisis management procedures are complete and tested. In this process, valid recommendations of international organizations will be closely followed for adequate implementation over time. It is important to have close coordination with other public authorities in the country, including government.  3. Anchors of macro-prudential policies The role of anchors in monetary policy is well known. I mentioned before that an important lesson from the crisis for authorities would be to rigorously pursue countercyclical policies. I would like to stop a bit here and focus on this issue. I believe that Albania was prepared for the crisis because IMF programs have played an important role as a credible foreign anchor for economic policies. The IMF programs and similar EU membership process have played a similar role in all CEE and SEE countries. However as the countries have matured out of these programs or joined the EU, the political incentives to continue fiscal consolidation have been fading away. Current events show that the symptoms have spread to other older members of EU, where such policies become the reason behind instability. Therefore the role of anchors is very important for preserving and safeguarding financial stability. Sound, clear and enforceable fiscal rule would be an important step. Effective supervision based on simple and clear capital adequacy and liquidity rules would be another. The Basel III accord is a first step in the right direction. A unified approach and technical toolkit to stress-testing exercises would be also helpful. The joint stress-test exercise conducted by the ESCB is the right way forward. I would however encourage broadening its scope in candidate and potential candidate countries of CEE, in order to have a unified measurement system throughout Europe. Lastly, other measures of financial imbalances such as excessive asset price increases, under-pricing of risks, search for yields and increased risk taking need to be better incorporated in the standard models used by central banks. Conclusion In the light of this discussion, a central bank could not avoid the responsibility of engaging to protect financial stability, even though this is not defined as a particular mandate. Our experience as an emerging country indicates that price and financial stability are preconditions for each other. Our motto is that any investment that we make in financial stability today will return high benefits in price stability in the long run.  BIS Review 173/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 173/2010 Concurrently, I think our collective experience throughout the crisis showed that more can done in order to develop and institutionalize the proper mechanisms that would allow for better FX liquidity management in EE countries. A mechanism such as the Vienna initiative that would encourage the commitment of parent banks to their EE subsidiaries and would discourage their financial disintermediation in these countries can be made permanent with added benefits to all the stakeholders. Furthermore, regulatory harmonization can be improved and regulatory arbitrage can be mitigated. On macro-prudential policies I argued on the need to develop specific anchors that would make more credible, transparent and therefore achievable the goal of financial stability. Measuring financial stability, or instability, might be difficult but that should not discourage us from trying. Thank you for your attention.   Box 1 Measures taken in the banking supervision area during the pre-crisis period.  On June 2007, the new Law on Banks in the Republic of Albania entered into force. This Law stipulates rigorous principles and rules on the risk management, aiming at protecting the depositors, investors and fostering the banking system’s stability.  On January 2008, the Credit Registry started the operation representing a vital infrastructure-related development.   On March 2008, the Bank of Albania adopted a package of regulatory amendments which were generally oriented to adopting more conservatory policies in several main directions of day-to-day commercial banking running. In more concrete terms, this therapy can be described:  In compliance with the new Law On Banks in the Republic of Albania, new quantitative thresholds were set for the calculation, supervision and reporting of banks’ large exposures to parent banks and related entities.   In order to better diversify the risk arising from the concentration in banks’ investments in the international financial markets, lower thresholds were set for banks’ large exposures.   Internal control is considered an integral part of banks’ governance. Hence, special emphasis was put in designing the key principles for an independent, unbiased and accountable internal control. Internal control should cover each section of the bank in order to prevent the origination and development of undesired risks.  Accountable governance is a key principle, especially on financial institutions, whose success is, among others, largely dependent on public confidence in them. Accordingly, the Bank of Albania considers the quality of human capacities – implying the hiring of skillful people in the decision-making process and risk management – as fundamental. The decision making process, should always be based on such expert opinions and recommendations.  The transparency related to the banking and financial products and services provided, was also paid special attention. The new legal requirements standardize the manner and form of providing information to the clients on the banking products and services banks provide.  Part of this new package was also the standardization of the required information that banks and branches of foreign banks should disclose, related to the banks’ main activity, their organization and management, their financial performance and position, the risk management and the accounting policies.   
Erkki Liikanen: Global rebalancing, asset prices and policy responses Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Fifth High-Level Seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American Central Banks, Madrid, 10 December 2010. *      *      * Due to the strike and weather conditions the speech was distributed in written form. Some background  Global imbalances are certainly not a new policy concern. The most visible manifestation of these imbalances is the large current account deficits and surpluses, but these are not the whole story. Current account positions reflect a number of deeper, more fundamental problems. Therefore, the inevitable future rebalancing has to involve deeper structural changes in the countries involved. The risks caused by the global imbalances have been well documented in research and policy papers over the last ten years. Also, the imbalances have long been among the central agenda items in several international meetings. Most recent serious efforts to address them include the IMF-led Multilateral Consultations in 2006 and, today, the ongoing G20 Mutual Assessment Process.  Such rounds of discussions have successfully established a broad agreement over the key policy objectives to resolve the problem. At their simplest, these are remarkably straightforward. National saving needs to increase in the major deficit countries (such as the United States), and be reduced in the major surplus countries (such as emerging Asia and the oil exporting countries). It has also been acknowledged that for both deficit and surplus countries, meeting these objectives requires significant policy adjustments. However, the multilateral initiatives to address global imbalances have so far suffered from an obvious lack of traction to actual policy outcomes. Since the onset of the global financial crisis, the imbalances have admittedly undergone a certain reduction. But recent projections indicate that the imbalances tend to persist – or even grow – well into the future. It appears that the imbalances have become an even more persistent characteristic of our economic environment than was previously thought. The nature of the imbalances  International surpluses and deficits are not, of course, harmful as such if they remain reasonable. They are a natural reflection of financial integration. They provide flexibility to savers and investors. By that, they are welfare enhancing. However, very large current account deficits, when persistent and growing, fuel concerns of external sustainability. Two main risks to the international community have been extensively debated for almost a decade. First, sustainability concerns may lead to a sudden collapse of confidence in the ability of the deficit countries to maintain their external positions. The resulting disruptive adjustment would be harmful for the deficit and surplus countries alike and to the bystander countries as well. So far, this risk has not materialized and for the moment, the US bond markets do not seem to consider it particularly acute. The second risk is that the imbalances may give rise to tensions in global trade as well as exchange rate relations; this risk is materializing constantly, as witnessed in the run-up to the Seoul G20 Summit. Beyond these two main risks, the financial crisis exposed a number of more subtle channels of transmission through which global imbalances undermine global economic stability. In particular, the enormous growth of financial intermediation and innovation, related to the BIS Review 172/2010 1 
imbalances, combined with regulatory weakness, has made the international financial system much too fragile relative to the accumulated risks. Also, the fragility of the international financial markets has led to a volatility of capital flows which may harm even fundamentally stable economies. Easy and simplistic explanations of global imbalances have typically failed to stand the test of time. They may explain the most conspicuous developments in any one time period, yet fail to capture the multitude of relevant factors at play. It is therefore necessary to think of the imbalances as products of several fundamental factors, which lie deeper than the superficial level of macroeconomic policies. I will not go into these in great detail, but wish merely to mention a couple of rather general trends. The low pre-crisis national saving rates in deficit economies were supported by low borrowing costs and the consequent asset price boom during the period of “great moderation”. The low borrowing costs themselves reflected a number of reasons – from the “global savings glut” in emerging markets to failures in financial markets’ risk assessments – and their relative significance certainly varies from country to country. But now, the economic structures of the deficit countries have adapted to the inflow of resources from abroad, and their internationally competitive sectors are smaller than they should be. The high saving rates in major surplus economies are largely driven broadly by two key factors. Official sector savings derive largely from export-lead growth strategies based on asset-accumulating competitive exchange rate pegs combined with capital controls. Private sector savings for their part are motivated by structural forces, including demographic trends, the lack of developed social safety nets and a still underdeveloped financial sector that hampers domestic lending – and channels domestic savings abroad. Of course, in some commodity exporting countries, surpluses and official sector savings have been boosted by elevated commodity prices. I would also like to emphasize the significance of the domestic policy contexts in the major deficit and surplus countries. As I mentioned in the beginning, the solution to the issue of external imbalances seems relatively simple if considered in isolation: just reverse the existing divergent trends in saving and investment ratios between the countries involved. It is important, however, to recognize that the global imbalances also reflect cross-country differences in economic structures and real resources, which give rise to differing policy interests.  The post-crisis outlook for the imbalances So what does the crisis imply for the evolution of the imbalances going forward? Here I wish to make a few brief observations. On the one hand, the challenge of external rebalancing in the deficit countries has become closely intertwined with the internal rebalancing between public and private demand. Whereas the low saving rates in major deficit economies previously reflected large-scale private sector borrowing, the rapid decline in private spending after the crisis replaced private deficits with sizeable public sector deficits. Too much of global demand and economic activity is now dependent on the fiscal deficits in the developed world. Therefore, the deficit countries here face a dual task: to rebalance the government budgets and, at the same time, to establish a growth-friendly economic environment that provides a sustainable foundation for the growth of private spending. In terms of policy, one priority here lies in measures to maintain the availability of credit to the private sector, for example through repair and reform of the financial sector. However, credit is not enough by itself. The growth of private demand must lie on a sustainable basis. In the deficit countries, future growth inevitably needs to rely increasingly 2 BIS Review 172/2010 
more on net exports. This is a competitiveness question, but also a structural question. And this, of course, goes part and parcel with the objective of reducing the external imbalances. On the other hand, recent events clearly demonstrate how the current crisis has increased the international pressure on emerging market countries with surpluses. This was clearly apparent at the last round of G20 discussions, where foreign exchange issues were at the centre of the agenda. Undoubtedly, the problem has not gone away and will be one of the hardest issues also in the upcoming meetings. However the exchange rate, the real exchange rate to be exact, is only a part of the adjustment mechanisms which can lead to a more balanced redistribution of economic activity and spending. In the end, the more the surplus countries can achieve through opening their markets, increasing competition, and diversifying their economies towards services, the less pressure will prevail on their exchange rates, and the smaller are the inflationary pressures they encounter. So, orderly balancing is about structural changes in all affected societies, in deficit countries as well as surplus countries, around the globe. The political difficulty of making these adjustments happen is considerable. The roles of the euro area and Latin America No matter how the eventual and necessary global adjustment will take place, it will have spill over effects that concern us all. What unites the Latin America and euro area is the fact that global imbalances are not a problem of our own making. Both regions, taken as aggregates, have had broadly balanced current accounts and maintained flexible exchange rate regimes. But still, neither region would be immune to the spill over effects from a possible disorderly adjustment. And they would not be immune to the changes in relative prices which go together with an orderly adjustment, either. It is this common role as exposed bystanders where the Latin American and European viewpoints meet, regarding the global imbalances. Policy makers in both regions worry about the danger of exchange rate volatility, and should think hard how to position their economies for the future, post-adjustment circumstances. For the euro area, the challenges are threefold. There is the fiscal challenge you are well aware of; there is the challenge of increasing the productivity of the Euro area economies, especially in the countries with big external deficits, and there is the challenge of strengthening our financial system, which was so severely shaken by the crisis. Of these, I think the productivity challenge is the most fundamental in the long run, and much of the fiscal sustainability issue hinges on that as well. And without credible public finances, there cannot be a lasting solution to the stability of the financial sector. Latin America for its part has already fallen victim to some of the fallout from global imbalances. Since the bust of the US asset price boom, the suppressed domestic demand coupled with near-zero interest policy has turned private capital to search for higher yield in the still-growing emerging markets. Latin America has painful experiences with excessive external indebtedness, and hence the prospect of large capital inflows causes understandable concern. Under such circumstances of potentially disruptive capital inflows, capital controls have understandably become an increasingly attractive option for emerging markets trying to temporarily smooth the inflow of foreign capital, alleviate excessive pressure on the exchange rate and mitigate a build-up of risk in their domestic economies. The debate over the desirability and effectiveness of capital controls is still ongoing and I do not wish to give definite advice on their proper role and scope. However, I do believe that BIS Review 172/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 172/2010 financial development and innovation tends to make the maintenance of capital controls progressively more difficult and ineffective. And even as views on the controls have become more pragmatic within the international community, the historical experience thus far is mixed. It is safest to consider them as a temporary expedient, which cannot be relied upon to provide a lasting solution. I would also note that a proliferation of capital controls can introduce potentially adverse distortions in the international financial system, which should not be ignored. Where necessary, the international community should therefore seek to establish common principles for their appropriate design. This is an area where the IMF policy advice and monitoring could have a greater role.  Conclusion: addressing the problem Finally, let me say a few words about how the problem of global imbalances could be constructively addressed. I will leave a more detailed discussion on this for the subsequent sessions of this seminar, but wish to highlight one observation that is relevant to what I have just said. If deficit and surplus countries would choose to pursue policies based on their narrowest self-interests, seeking to postpone inevitable structural changes, the problems of global imbalances – and their adverse effects – would be likely to persist. The only way to address the problem is international policy coordination. It is not enough to simply demonstrate that the imbalances can be addressed through an orderly, policy-driven adjustment. What is also required is a credible commitment from all key stakeholders to follow a cooperative approach. As I see it, success in the latter requires two things. Partly, the commitment to a cooperative approach is a commitment to compromise. This can be achieved only through an open and direct interaction involving all key players. Despite its limitations, the G20 Mutual Assessment Process is the best tool we have for the task. Its mere existence has facilitated an exchange of views that was long lacking from international policy coordination. But, and fortunately so, the necessary global rebalancing is not only about making compromises. The world economy is not a zero sum game, and better cooperation delivers real benefits to be shared. One needs to present a convincing enough a case – in both the major deficit and surplus economies – that the spillovers from globally inconsistent policies, are not in the interest of any country. This is certainly not an easy feat and will be a major challenge in the discussions going forward. The challenge is even larger because the solution involves so deep adjustments, not only in macroeconomic policies, but in the very economic structures of the countries involved.  
Choongsoo Kim: The prospects for the Korean economy in 2011 Keynote speech by Mr Choongsoo Kim, Governor of the Bank of Korea, at the Seoul Foreign Correspondents’ Club (SFCC), Seoul, 13 December 2010. *      *      * I. International and domestic economic conditions 1. International conditions World economy Although the underlying recovery of the world economy is still on track, there seems little sign of any narrowing of the gap between the advanced countries and the newly emerging countries in what has been termed the two-speed global recovery1.  (USA) The macroeconomic policy stance of pump priming activity has been maintained for example by means of QE2, and the scale of the increase in facilities investment has widened because of the upturn in firms’ profitability. – We are unlikely, however, to see any great strengthening of the recovery momentum as a recovery in the labor and housing markets is yet to be seen while improvements in the saving rate continues.   (China) Shrugging-off the mildness of the recovery in the advanced countries, the Chinese economy has maintained its strong growth trend on the basis for domestic demand in line with the large scale of the rise in incomes and the measures2 to promote consumption.                                                  1 Ben Bernanke, Rebalancing the Global Recovery (November 19); Masaaki Shirakawa, Advanced and emerging economies – two speed recovery (November 23). 2 Payments to assist in the purchase of white goods are expected to be made up until January 2013 and, in accordance with the new economic plan for 2011–2015, social security expenditures are likely to e greatly increased to safeguard public welfare. BIS Review 172/2010 1 
– Consumer prices and asset prices seem set to show unstable movements as the increase in liquidity by way of foreign capital inflows comes on top of the demand pressures from the high growth rates.   The major economic forecasting institutes are predicting that the rate of growth of the world economy will be a little above 4% in 2011 and around 4 1/2% in 2012. Global financial markets Globally, credit conditions are forecast to continue their improving trends owing mainly to the accommodative monetary policy stance of the major advanced countries.  For the US and the eurozone, bank lending has shifted to an increase since this September.  The other side of the coin is that global financial market uncertainty is on the rise because of euro area’s debt problems and additional quantitative easing. 2 BIS Review 172/2010 
 (Euro area debt problems) Despite the funding support from the EU and the IMF, the sovereign debt problems of certain EU member states are likely to act as a factor making for market unrest for a considerable time to come. – If eurozone debt problems do worsen, there is the possibility that the credit risk of newly emerging market countries would also increase owing to a strengthened preference for safe haven assets.  (QE2) The global financial markets are likely to react extremely sensitively to the direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy ahead of the expiry of the second quantitative easing at the end of next June. – Market attention may well focus on whether or not there will be further quantitative easing (QE3).3  Commodity markets International oil prices are forecast to maintain their upward trend in line with the continued recovery of the world economy and the increase in global liquidity.  Next year demand for crude is likely to surpass supply albeit only by a small margin, led by the emerging market countries (+500,000bpd). – The fact that the OECD countries’ oil inventories are now at their highest level since 2005 will act as a factor limiting the scale of upward movement in the oil price.  Global liquidity, which has expanded greatly in line with QE2, could put upward pressure on oil prices if it feeds through into commodity markets.                                                    3  In the announcement of the Federal Reserve’s FOMC for November, mention is made of the possibility of additional steps in accordance with future economic activity. BIS Review 172/2010 3 
 2. Domestic conditions Fiscal spending Budgetary expenditures next year will be increased 6.0% over this year (260 trillion won) to 276 trillion won while for the year 2012 there will be a 4.0% increase to 287 trillion won.  The extent of the front-loading of fiscal spending during the first half of 2011 will be gradually scaled back so that around 2012 it will be back to its pre-crisis level.4 The ratio of the fiscal deficit to GDP will decline from 1.9% this year to 1.6% in 2011 as tax revenues increase5.  The sovereign debt ratio will decline from 36.1% this year to 35.1% next year.                                                   4 For the years 2004–07, the front loading of expenditures during the  first half averaged 53.7%. 5 The government intends to achieve a balanced budget by 2013 or 2014. 4 BIS Review 172/2010 
Household consumption Household purchasing power is forecast to expand thanks to higher incomes resulting from the continued economic upswing.  Households are also expected to become more consumption-minded.  – Share prices, which form a leading indicator of consumer sentiment, have risen strongly since this September.6 Having said this, the worsening of the terms of trade, could act as a factor limiting the increase in consumption.  Corporate investment Even in 2011, conditions for corporate investment are expected to present a comparatively favorable picture as growth trends are maintained in major branches of industry while capacity utilization rates run at high levels.  World demand for IT products and cars is increasing continually while domestic demand is also buoyant owing to the effect of new products such as smartphones. Construction investment, though, is likely to remain sluggish.  In the housing market, although there is some likelihood of private sector housing construction picking up as it shows signs of shaking off its long time torpor, the public sector, for its part, is predicted to present a subdued picture in line with this year’s large-scale reduction in permits issued.                                                      6 It is estimated that the rise in share prices during the first three quarters of this year added some 44 trillion won to the stock of financial assets.

 II.  Main assumptions & economic outlook 1. Main assumptions of the forecasts The growth of the world economy next year is set at 4.0%, reflecting the economic conditions in major countries (4.3% in 2012). The rate of the expansion of world trade is assumed to be 6.7% (7.3%in 2012). The price of a barrel of crude oil (annualized average) is set at USD 87 per barrel (USD 90 in 2012). Main assumptions  6 BIS Review 172/2010 
2. Economic outlook Growth The GDP growth rate in 2011 is forecast to register 4.5%.   In terms of each half year, it is expected to accelerate over the course of the year, running at 3.8% in the first half and 5.0% in the latter half.  For 2012, it is forecast to rise to 4.7%. Let us now look at the details of growth next year by sectors of expenditure.  Private consumption is predicted to increase constantly in line with the expansion in household purchasing power (4.1% in 2011 and 4.3% in 2012).  Facilities investment, similarly, should mark a solidly-based upward trend, but the scale of its increase is expected to narrow owing to the completion this year of the majority of investment projects held over because of the financial crisis (6.5% in 2011 and 6.3% 2012).  Construction investment is expected to stage no more than a slight increase (1.4% in 2011 and 1.3% in 2012).  Exports are forecast to continue on their strongly upward track, boosted by the advanced countries’ sustained recovery mode and the strong growth being registered in the newly emerging countries (9.6% in 2011 and 12.5% in 2012). Outlook for economic growth  Employment The number of persons in employment is forecast to rise by 260,000 in 2011 and by 280,000 in 2012.  The unemployment rate should drop from 3.8% this year to around 3.5% next year.  BIS Review 172/2010 7 
 Prices Consumer price inflation is seen to accelerate to 3.5% in 2011 and to rise about 3.2% in 2012.  The rate of core inflation, similarly, will edge up above 3% from next year.  Current account The current account surplus for 2011 is expected to narrow in scale from this year's 29 billion dollars to 18 billion dollars.  For 2012 it is forecast to be around 16 billion dollars.  8 BIS Review 172/2010 
III.  Overall assessment & policy tasks Overall assessment 1. Next year’s GDP growth rate of 4.5% will be at the trend level7.  The trend of an increase in economic activity should continue as next year’s Q4 growth (year-on-year) is projected at 5.6%, well above this year’s 4.8%.   In terms of expenditure sectors, domestic demand and exports are likely to act as twin sources of growth owing to the strengthening of private consumption and facilities investment. – The net growth contribution of domestic demand8 will be 2.5% and that of exports 2.0%. o The government’s net growth contribution will be at the level of 0.7 percentage point, the same as in an average year (2001~07 average: 0.7%p).                                                    7 This year’s 6.1% figure was greatly influenced by the base-period effect during the course of overcoming the global financial crisis. 8 The figures are calculated first by computing the scale of imports induced by domestic demand and exports using the import generation coefficient of the industrial input-output tables by sectors. The scale of imports is then subtracted from the relevant sector. BIS Review 172/2010 9 
 The perceived level of economic activity is expected to improve further as the growth contribution of domestic demand increases, but it is likely to be difficult to narrow significantly its differential from the actual level of economic activity. – The rate of increase of gross domestic income (GDI) will trail that of economic growth because of the worsening of the terms of trade.  2. In the labor market, the trend of improvement will be maintained with a private-sector-led increase in the number of persons employed and a fall in the unemployment rate.  Having said that, the degree of improvement in qualitative terms will be checked somewhat by the feebleness of large businesses in the creation of what are seen as “decent jobs”9.  3. Consumer prices are expected to stay on a rising track for quite some time, carrying over from the 3 1/2% level for this quarter.                                                  9 Even as the number of persons employed in the private sector increased by a total of 382,000 running up to October of this year, that of large corporations decreased by 49,000. 10 BIS Review 172/2010 
 Demand pressures are being built up from the sustained rise in economic activity and international commodity prices, wages and rental charges are all on the rise.  The accelerated upward trend of Chinese wages and prices may also act as a cost push factor for domestic prices by way of higher import prices.  Expected inflation, which has been on the rise since the beginning of this year, will affect prices after some time lag.  4. The current account will retain its underlying surplus but the scale of this surplus is seen to shrink owing to the expansion of imports drawn in by the strengthened recovery momentum of domestic demand.  The ratio of the current account surplus to GDP will drop from this year’s 3% level to below 2.0% but above 1.5% in 2011.  5. These economic forecasts for 2011 are attended by a considerable degree of uncertainty. Domestically, there are the geopolitical risks following the North Korean attack on Yeonpyeongdo. Externally, the unknowns include the sovereign debt problems of the euro area, price instability in China, and the direction of the US Fed’s monetary policy post-QE2. BIS Review 172/2010 11 
12 BIS Review 172/2010 Policy tasks 1. While the Korean economy will stay on a solid growth track in 2011, political initiatives should be directed toward raising the living conditions of the public at large including the boosting of purchasing power by way of price stability and the creation of “decent jobs”, given the persistent gap between public perceptions of the level of economic activity and the actual numbers. 2. Great care must be taken to avoid an enfeebling influence on the domestic financial and foreign exchange markets and on real economic activity from the eurozone debt problems, Chinese inflation and the Fed’s monetary policy course post-QE2. 3. In order to respond to an increase in the level of uncertainty of the external environment, a policy mix should be devised that emphasizes the twin growth pillars of domestic demand and exports. 
Hirohide Yamaguchi: Challenges for Japan’s financial system after the financial crisis Speech by Mr Hirohide Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the symposium co-hosted by the University of Tokyo and Development Bank of Japan, Tokyo, 10 December 2010. *      *      * Introduction It is my great honor to have an opportunity to speak at a symposium co-hosted by the Center for Advanced Research in Finance, the University of Tokyo, and the Research Institute of Capital Formation, Development Bank of Japan. While the global financial crisis that erupted about two years ago, triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers has not been completely over, the situation has significantly improved. Progress has also been made in establishing an international framework for preventing the recurrence of the recent global crisis in the future. Meanwhile, Japan’s Financial System has been relatively stable, compared with that in the United States and Europe, but some challenges have become clear as the effects of the crisis reached here in various forms.  In those circumstances, it is indeed topical to discuss today how the future of Japan’s financial system should be, and I am looking forward to the discussions by the experts. For my part, I will briefly review the financial crisis and talk about the future of Japan’s financial system and challenges for Japanese financial institutions. I. Global financial crisis and Japan’s financial system A. The international financial system after the Lehman shock These two years following the failure of Lehman Brothers have been indeed a tumultuous period for the global economy and the international financial system. Following the failure of Lehman Brothers, a financial crisis erupted on a global scale, and the global economy deteriorated simultaneously and rapidly. Subsequently, due to the effects of exhaustive policy responses by the governments and central banks, the global economy gradually started to recover around the spring of 2009 and profits and funding conditions of major U.S. and European financial institutions improved significantly. However, against a backdrop of European fiscal problems including those in Greece and Ireland as well as heightened uncertainty about the future of the U.S. economy, there have been phases in which financial markets have become unstable again since the spring of 2010. In the United States and Europe, amid continued balance sheet adjustments, bank lending has been sluggish and credit costs have been somewhat at high levels. The international financial system is still in a fragile state. B. Effects on Japan’s financial system Looking at the impact of the global financial crisis on Japan’s financial system, there was relatively a large decline in the functioning of CP and corporate bond markets. On the other hand, the direct impact on financial institutions central to Japan’s financial intermediation remained relatively small, compared with that on U.S. and European financial institutions, and the stability of the financial system as a whole was maintained. Three reasons can be pointed out. First, and probably the major reason, was that Japanese financial institutions had been generally cautious about taking risks based on the experience of the financial crisis since the BIS Review 172/2010 1 
1990s. Specifically, their investments in complex financial products such as collateralized debt obligation had been low and they had not adopted, unlike major U.S. and European financial institutions, the originate-to-distribute business model in a full-fledged manner.  Second, in terms of incentive, there was relatively low pressure from shareholders who pursued short-term returns and the remuneration system of financial institutions’ managers was also not conducive to short-term risk-taking activity. Third, as a result of the efforts by the public authorities to enhance the robustness of the financial system, including an establishment of a resolution framework for financial institutions, concern about the surfacing of systemic risk did not heighten among depositors and market participants. Nevertheless, the global financial crisis has also affected Japan’s economy in various forms such as a deterioration in economic activity, a fall in stock prices, and a decline in market functioning. Japanese financial institutions have also been hit accordingly in the form of impairment due to a decline in stock prices and of an increase in credit costs. In the meantime, the challenges Japanese financial institutions have been faced with, such as the weakness of core profitability and vulnerability against stock price fluctuations, have been highlighted again. I will come back to the details later. II. Prospects for Japan’s financial system A. Changing environment surrounding Japan’s financial system The topic of today’s panel discussion is “Whither the Financial System?” It is quite a difficult question, but in the hope of providing some reference to the discussion, I offer some consideration of how Japan’s financial system should be after the financial crisis both from macro and micro perspectives. As it might be useful to consider first what changes are expected in the environment surrounding Japan’s financial system in the future, let me start with the following three points. Strengthening of global regulation and supervision First, financial regulation and supervision will be strengthened on a global basis. On regulations, vigorous discussions are ongoing internationally, and the issues covered are quite wide, ranging from banks’ capital adequacy and liquidity, leverage, remuneration, and accounting. In terms of supervision, the scope will be widened mainly to cover those which have not been taken up sufficiently in the past, such as the so-called shadow banking system. Let me talk about some recent developments. For example, in terms of banks’ capital, an internationally common new regulatory framework, namely, Basel III, has recently been agreed on. Both the quality and the quantity of bank’s capital will be enhanced, albeit gradually, through increasing the ratios of common equities and Tier I that have a high loss absorbing capacity at the time of bankruptcy. Like the so-called “Volcker Rule” in the United States, there are also moves to directly regulate banks’ high risk businesses such as proprietary trading and investment in hedge funds. Through next year, the issue of moral hazard associated with systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs), namely, the “too-big-to-fail problem,” is expected to be discussed, including how to specify SIFIs and what responses will be necessary in preventing the failure of the specified SIFIs or in minimizing the impact once they fail. If I can offer my opinion on that issue, given the essence of the issue of avoiding moral hazard, it would be desirable to take a flexible approach. Namely, in accordance with the situation in each country, appropriate responses should be chosen from various options including not only a bank capital surcharge but also a liquidity surcharge and strengthening of supervision, and establishment of a resolution framework. 2 BIS Review 172/2010 
Increase in new demand for funds Second, as the contents of demand for funds financial institutions are faced with at home and abroad change, there is a possibility that new demand for funds will increase. For example, emerging economies are expected to continue to be the driving force of the global economy, and thus fund demand for improving infrastructure and for firms’ business fixed investment as well as for asset management associated with an accumulation of personal financial assets in those economies, is expected to further increase. Turning to the domestic areas, in the process of firms exploring new growth strategies and rebuilding the supply system for goods and services, there could be new fund demand for research and development as well as business relocation. Moreover, as the industrial structure is expected to change further, there will be increased importance of fund demand associated with corporate rehabilitation and realignment such as M&A finance and DIP finance and of fund demand from emerging companies that challenge new areas. Moreover, needs for asset management mainly by elderly people are expected to diversify and increase.  Changes in business models for globally active major financial institutions  Third, business models of globally active major financial institutions might change. Specifically, the originate-to-distribute business model that had been actively used prior to the crisis will relatively decrease in number and the proportion of commercial banking business that put more emphasis on the relationship with customers is likely to increase: that is called “back to basics.” Moreover, as business regulations such as the Volcker Rule will be implemented and regulation and supervision will be reviewed in order to restrain “too-big-to-fail,” it is likely that the moves toward mere scale expansion and toward excessive risk-taking will be restrained. In terms of funding, as awareness about liquidity risk heightened considerably through the experience of the financial crisis, more emphasis would be put on retail deposits, which have more stability than short-term wholesale funding such as repo transactions. Such changes in business models of globally active major financial institutions could have an impact on the business models and the competitiveness of Japanese financial institutions. B. Future of Japan’s financial system: macro perspective I will next touch on how Japan’s financial system should be in the future from a macro perspective, namely, a perspective of financial system structure. Needless to say again, Japan’s financial system has long been characterized by financial intermediation centering on banks. In this situation, from a perspective of improving the functioning and stability of the financial system, many have argued as follows. It is desirable to have not only bank-based financial intermediation but also financial intermediation through the capital market, inclusive of the so-called market-based financial intermediation. To that end, it will be necessary to increase the supply of risk money and eventually enhance the diversification of households’ asset investment. In fact, many policy measures have been taken to bolster such moves, including enhancement in market infrastructure, improvement in market transparency, and investor protection. If we revisit the discussions based on the experience of the recent crisis, it can be summarized as follows. First, the complementarity of functioning between banks and capital market is important. While the functioning of corporate bond and CP markets declined significantly in Japan during the crisis, bank lending substituted the financial intermediation function during such phase and underpinned the rapidly deteriorating firms’ funding. Subsequently, when the functioning of the capital market was restored, bank lending started to decline. Therefore, it became clear again that the existence of multiple financial intermediation channels is important for the availability of firms’ funding and the robustness of the financial system. BIS Review 172/2010 3 
Second, the existence of multiple financial intermediation channels alone would not be sufficient to ensure financial system stability. Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Greenspan once pointed out that one reason for Japan’s protracted crisis was that its financial intermediation was concentrated on banks, and the financial system like that in the United States, which has a variety of financial intermediation channels, would be more robust against shocks to the financial system and the real economy. However, the fact that the crisis deepened in the United States implies that such view is not necessarily correct. What is important is that each financial system participant maintains business soundness and pursues solid risk management, and, at the same time, that the regulatory and supervisory authorities and central banks recognize where the risks lie in the financial system as a whole from a macro perspective and take proper responses. Namely, I believe it is critical for financial system stability to maintain not only the robustness of the financial system structure but also self discipline of financial system participants and the risk capturing capability of the authorities at a high level as a whole.  C. Challenges for Japanese financial institutions: micro perspective  I will next talk about two specific challenges for Japanese financial institutions. I will touch on the challenges for the authorities in the final part of my speech.  Selecting business models and sustained improvement in profitability  The first and the biggest challenge for Japanese financial institutions is to raise their profitability in a sustained manner. Looking at the recent business performance of Japanese financial institutions, core profitability has been trending down due partly to a narrowing profit margin and declining lending outstanding. For that reason, an increase in profitability is an imminent challenge. In doing so, while it applies to every industry, it is essential to choose the optimal business model that utilizes an institution’s respective realms of expertise. As I have mentioned earlier, competition in commercial banking business, in which Japanese financial institutions are mainly engaged, is expected to intensify at home and abroad. Japanese financial institutions that receive domestic stable personal deposits have an advantage, including funding for overseas activities, in terms of resilience against liquidity risk. Moreover, a characteristic of Japanese financial institutions that traditionally put emphasis on the customer relationship is an important element in terms of “information production,” which is a key to conducting lending business, and could serve positively for businesses not only in Japan but also in overseas including Asian countries. Furthermore, Japanese firms and households, which are the main customers of Japanese financial institutions, are not in need of balance sheet adjustments like those in the United States and Europe. Therefore, in terms of the competitiveness of Japanese financial institutions compared with that of the U.S. and European financial institutions, I believe there is nothing to be pessimistic. With that recognition, what is necessary for Japanese financial institutions is, at first, to hone their skills in identifying firms with growth potential and continue to strive to find new borrowers and also tap new fund demand from the existing borrowers. While a fundamental problem Japan’s economy is faced with is a decline in medium- to long-term growth expectations, to overcome such problem, it is important that private firms promote their innovative activities and pursue a new source of growth at home and abroad. It is essential that financial institutions also firmly support such moves. In that regard, looking at the recent efforts by Japanese financial institutions, there have been proactive developments to utilize their respective characteristics, which is quite assuring. The major banks have been further expanding their businesses in Asian and other emerging economies regardless of customers’ nationality, and the regional banks have been making efforts to tap growth areas in the regions, including distinct local firms. I hope that Japanese financial institutions will establish their respective business models and pursue proactive efforts including tapping new fund 4 BIS Review 172/2010 
demand, while skillfully gauging various changes in the business environment at home and abroad. Second, it is also important to raise the core profitability of the existing borrowing firms through enhancing their governance. It has often been said in Japan that corporate governance that raises a firm’s profitability has been weak. There are many views that, one way to overcome such weakness is to use equity funds, which have a strong tendency to search for yields, as leverage to strengthen corporate governance from outside. Financial institutions can play a significant role in that regard by being involved in creating investment funds. Moreover, the role of a financial institution as a lender is also not insignificant. Many Japanese financial institutions appear to have been relying too much on real estate collateral and personal guarantees when providing loans especially to medium and small firms, and governance after loan provision has not necessarily been sufficient. Financial institutions are required to bolster firms’ growth constantly through deepening the ongoing relationship with them. In complementing such support, lending that uses movable assets, such as inventories, or accounts receivables as collateral – the so-called asset-based lending – or that utilizes covenants for medium and small firms can be useful options. Third, it is intrinsically important for financial institutions to play a role in encouraging metabolism, for example, corporate realignment. At the same time, it is also important that financial institutions also aim at metabolizing themselves through mergers, consolidation, or unbundling, in accordance with their own business models. For example, financial institutions that aim to be globally active could pursue the advantage of scale or scope through mergers and acquisitions. By contrast, for financial institutions that aspire to enhance their presence in niche markets, limiting functions and concentrating resources could be an important option. Those financial institutions’ behavior is expected to not only improve management efficiency of individual financial institutions through increased competitiveness but also lead to increased profitability of the financial sector as a whole through efficient resource reallocation. Proper risk management The second challenge for Japanese financial institutions is proper risk management. In that regard, there is an increasing awareness among financial institutions, including those overseas, of the importance of the following: to gauge risk comprehensively, for example, by way of stress testing, without relying too much on specific quantitative methods such as VaR, and to share the recognition of risks not only in the risk management section but also including top management. In addition to such general challenge, a reduction in market risk associated with stockholdings, in particular, would be a specific challenge for the future. As for market risk associated with stockholdings, many Japanese financial institutions have recognized the magnitude of price volatility associated with stockholdings and have been taking steps to reduce such risk as a management priority. Nevertheless, the pace of reduction in stockholdings has somewhat slowed recently due partly to sluggish stock prices and thus the due amount of market risk associated with stockholdings still remains. Of course, stockholdings could have implications as a part of corporate governance or could play a role as a tool to gain total profits including fee revenues. Even in those cases, however, it is important to firmly identify the risks and returns. On that basis, if it is judged that the risk is larger, financial institutions are required to steadily promote efforts toward the reduction of their stockholdings. Concluding remarks While I have been talking about the challenges for Japanese financial institutions, the recent crisis left various lessons for the regulatory and supervisory authorities as well as central banks. In relation to ensuring financial system stability, one lesson might be that “it is important to gauge with a sharp distinction between micro-level risks, such as risks of BIS Review 172/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 172/2010 individual financial institutions, and risks of the financial system as a whole.” By taking that point into account, the importance of the so-called macroprudence – which aims at accurately gauging the risks of the financial system as a whole, with due recognition of the relationship between economic activity, financial markets, and financial institutions, and taking necessary policy responses – has been increasingly recognized on a global basis.  In that regard, the Bank of Japan has been, from a standpoint of conducting monetary policy, monitoring a wide range of economic and financial developments at home and abroad and making in-depth research and analyses, as well as striving to improve infrastructure, including financial markets and the payment and settlement system. In addition, the Bank has been gauging business conditions of individual financial institutions through on-site bank examination and off-site monitoring, and information and perspectives obtained through such processes have been utilized in gauging the condition of the financial system as a whole and in risk analyses, and published in the Financial System Report. Also, the Bank took measures such as purchases of banks’ stockholdings and provision of subordinated loans aiming at ensuring the stability of the financial system as a whole. The Bank has thus been making various efforts on the macroprudence front.  Nevertheless, such efforts are only half done. For example, gauging macro risks is still not sufficient. From a viewpoint of strengthening macroprudential analysis, the Bank has been trying in the Financial System Report to broaden analyses to businesses other than banks, for example, insurance companies, to gauge macro financial imbalances, and to expand stress testing, but those efforts still remain at a stage of trial and error. In addition, the Bank is aware that, even if the macro risk is properly gauged, it still remains as a future challenge to examine what specific policy measures would be desirable to address the risk.  The Bank will, including the responses to the challenges I have mentioned, continue with the efforts to ensure stability of the financial system. 
Nout Wellink: Rebuilding the financial sector Speech by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the Colloquium of the Centre for Financial Studies, Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2010. *      *      * Introduction 1.  Ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis that has raged since July 2007 is a many-headed monster. At its core is a lack of market confidence in financial institutions and in some countries. I will speak about the background to the global financial crisis, its impact, and about the current situation in some European countries. I will elaborate on some challenges we face for the future. In particular, I will focus on strengthening the resilience of the banking sector, including the approach towards too-big-to-fail banks. I will conclude with the initiatives to enhance macro-prudential supervision. Causes of the global crisis Global fire fuelled by interdependencies, … 2.  After the first signs of difficulties with subprime mortgages in the United States emerged in the summer of 2007, they were long thought to be a specific US problem that would only indirectly affect other parts of the world. That proved an illusion: the mortgage problem in the US was the spark that set the system on fire worldwide. The flame was kindled by the negligent contracting of mortgage loans, via risky constructions and poor documentation. The popularity of financial innovations generated an opaque pyramid of financial risks that became steadily more unstable. … and insufficient buffers 3.  The innovations enlarged the net leverage in the system, because they enabled banks to operate with an ever slimmer capital position; the ratio between assets and capital at large banks before the crisis averaged out at more than 30. The supervision of liquidity risks at banks was inadequate and fragmented, also in Europe. In addition, the innovations deepened the interdependencies between financial institutions, and hence the pace and scope of contagion channels. In other words: the fuel to start a great fire was omnipresent. The crisis eventually erupted with great force after the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The losses caused by that collapse and the major uncertainty about who exactly was hit, led to a disappearance of market confidence and a full-blown systemic crisis. Global imbalances contributed to indiscipline 4.  Although the relative importance of the various causes is subject to debate, there is now a rather broad consensus about the developments that led to the crisis. The globalisation and integration of some parts of the global economy, like China and Eastern Europe, that had thus far been isolated was coupled with the build-up of global imbalances. Excessive debt build-up in Western, notably Anglo-Saxon, countries went in tandem with huge surpluses in oil-exporting countries and Asian countries. Asian countries stuck to a stable currency, causing the imbalances to continue and their currency reserves to accumulate. The investment of these reserves in the US kept US interest rates low, the so-called global savings glut, contributing to financial indiscipline in that country. BIS Review 171/2010 1 
Loose monetary policy another cause 5.  The accommodating monetary policy, particularly in the US, sowed the seeds for the imbalances. In the years before the crisis, money supply growth well outpaced potential GDP growth. This was not reflected in mounting inflation, because the supply of relatively cheap products from Asia kept price rises moderate. Nonetheless, the monetary expansion resulted in an acceleration of asset prices and credit aggregates. Before the crisis, lending in industrial countries grew by around 10% annually. The low interest rates and the abundant availability of credit encouraged a search for yield. Risks were underpriced and bubbles could easily arise, especially in real estate. This was the case in the US but also in some European countries. With hindsight, the interest rates were too low to tame the monetary expansion and other, more macro-prudential, instruments should have been deployed to contain the credit expansion. What has been the impact of the crisis? Serious damage in financial sector, partly at governments’ expense 6.  Writedowns on securitisation products and on ordinary loans led to huge losses in the banking sector. Banks worldwide have written down around USD 1,400 billion. This blew big holes in their capital base, and in order to uphold confidence in the sector, governments rigged up extensive support programmes. Some USD 500 billion was pumped into the banks, while bank debts and asset risks were guaranteed and deposit guarantees were extended. Large amounts were required to stabilise institutions, relative to GDP especially in Ireland, Belgium and the UK. Real economy hit hard 7.  The current economic downturn is deeper, more prolonged and more widespread than those occurring after 15 previous crisis periods in history, according to a multi-country study by Reinhart and Reinhart (2010). This reflects the radical deleveraging in the financial system. The study shows that deleveraging after a financial crisis is often initially postponed and is a lengthy process of on average seven years. The revival following a financial crisis hence tends to be very slow. A rapid recovery in the global economy set in over a year ago. As of the end of last year, that recovery has gradually flattened out somewhat, but the likelihood of a double dip in the US seems slight. The European debt crisis: imbalances underpin negative momentum 8.  Let me mention some words on the debt crisis that is currently plaguing Europe, on the causes and on the policy response. It was clear when establishing EMU that the currency union did not satisfy the ideal conditions. A currency union should preferably be coupled with a political union, and the latter – notwithstanding the continuing European integration – is still not in place. Large balance-of-payments imbalances had been built up, with Germany and the Netherlands running surpluses of around 5% of GDP and the so called peripheral countries reporting deficits of 5% of GDP or more. The current account deficits were a signal of major structural imbalances, such as in public finances. When investors became reluctant to finance the deficits, the debt crisis unfolded. This threatened financial stability Europe-wide because the countries in the euro area are highly interdependent financially. Decisive action by governments required 9.  In the market turbulence last May, Greece was the epicentre. With drastic intervention, government leaders and the ECB temporarily managed to turn the tide and 2 BIS Review 171/2010 
market turmoil abated. However, owing to concerns surrounding Ireland, the market turbulence flared up again recent weeks, with market participants fearing potential contagion to other peripheral countries. To maintain market and public confidence, it is essential that countries make every effort to introduce a credible consolidation programme and reforms to bring public finances onto a sustainable path. The primary responsibility for improving public finances lies with the authorities. Moreover, Europe and the IMF have set up an ultimate safety net that could also be resorted to if need be, while the Eurosystem provides enhanced credit support with the aim of safeguarding monetary transmission and preventing tight credit rationing in the private sector. In November, Ireland concluded a program with the European Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB. This program will deliver an important contribution to restoring financial stability in the country. Lessons learned and challenges 10.  The worldwide crisis has exposed some fundamentally weak spots in the international economy and the global financial system. In many cases the efforts to address them have only just got under way, while there is still much uncertainty about the effects of the measures. I will focus on two main challenges, first strengthening the banking sector and second enhancing macro-prudential oversight. Strengthening the resilience of banks 11.  Banks were at the epicentre of the crisis. After the wave of bank collapses, nationalisations, conversions, break-ups, sales, bailouts – all of which impacted on the real economy – the financial and banking system seems to have stabilised and to be on its way to recovery. However, reforms are essential to make the financial and the banking system truly resilient during periods of stress. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has announced a comprehensive package of measures to strengthening the banking sector. The contents of what we now call Basel III were endorsed by the G20 World leaders, in Seoul beginning of November. Basel III contains bankspecific reforms, the goal of which is to make banks more resilient to shocks. It also addresses system wide risks, as a bank-specific approach will not be enough. Bank specific reforms 12.  The core of the bank-specific reforms is stronger capital and liquidity regulation. Raising the quality of the capital base has been one of the primary objectives of Basel III. In the future, the emphasis will be on core capital, that is common equity and retained earnings, and banks will have less incentive to attract lower quality capital. In line with these qualitative improvements is the increase in the minimum quantity of regulatory capital. For the first time, a hard minimum requirement has been set for core capital, namely 4.5% of a bank’s total risk-weighted assets. In addition, the Committee has improved risk coverage of the regulatory framework and more improvements are on the way. The goal is to ensure that all material risks are captured. During the crisis, many risks were not reflected in the risk-based regime. Capital requirements for trading book exposures as well as for complex securitisations and exposures to off-balance-sheet vehicles will be increased substantially, about three to four times the old capital requirements. 13.  An additional element to the capital framework is a leverage ratio, which will serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital requirement. In the lead-up to the crisis, many banks reported very strong risk-based capital ratios while, at the same time, managed to build up high levels of on- and off-balance sheet leverage. The use of a supplementary leverage ratio will help contain the build-up of excessive leverage. It will also serve as an additional safeguard against attempts to “game” the risk-based requirements and it will help address model risk. A minimum leverage ratio of 3% will be tested during an observation period. BIS Review 171/2010 3 
14.  The proposed liquidity framework will also have a profound effect since a global liquidity standard does not currently exist. During the crisis, funding remained in short supply for an extended period. In response, the Committee has proposed global minimum liquidity standards to make banks more resilient to potential short-term disruptions in access to funding and to address longer-term structural liquidity mismatches in their balance sheets. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio will require banks to have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand a 30-day stressed funding scenario. This is complemented by the Net Stable Funding Ratio, which is a longer-term structural ratio designed to address liquidity mismatches. Addressing system-wide risks 15.  However, this firm-specific approach by itself will not be sufficient. Broader macroprudential measures to strengthen the entire banking system are equally important. An essential element in addressing system wide risk is the build up of buffers in good times that can be drawn down in periods of stress. The Committee has introduced two capital buffers. First a capital conservation buffer, which will increase the minimum capital requirements with 2.5%. As bank’s capital levels move closer to minimum requirements, the conservation buffer will impose a constraint on its discretionary distributions, like dividend payments, share buybacks and bonuses. Secondly, the countercyclical buffer, which would be imposed when excess credit growth is associated with an excessive build-up of system-wide risk. This buffer can vary between 0 and 2.5%. 16.  In order to give banks time to adjust to the new requirements and to support the ongoing economic recovery, Basel III will be implemented gradually. From 2013 onwards, the increase of the minimum requirement for core capital will be phased in three years’ time. And only thereafter the capital conservation buffer will be introduced step-by-step in four years’ time. The new liquidity standards will be implemented after an observation period to ensure their effectiveness. Too important to fail 17.  But an effective system wide focuses also addresses problems related to interconnectedness and the perception that some banks are too important to fail. Some institutions have grown so vital for financial stability that they have become systemically important and their failure is not a socially acceptable option. During the financial crisis, government authorities had no other choice then to save these institutions. At the same time losses of external capital providers were kept to a minimum. Let me explain the concept of systemically important financial institutions, the so called SIFIs, and discuss the international policy response to address the problems related to “too important to fail”. 18.  There are roughly three characteristics that make an institution systemically important: its size, interconnectedness and limited substitutability. Size measures the volume of financial services provided by a financial institution. Interconnectedness increases the extent to which problems at an institution may affect the financial system. This may happen via an institution’s direct links with other institutions as well as indirectly, via its role in the financial infrastructure or financial markets. The third factor, limited substitutability, indicates that if crucial functions or services cannot be quickly and easily taken over by another party, the system can become seriously disrupted. 19.  Aside from these structural characteristics of institutions, two other factors may accelerate the spillover to the entire financial system. First of all, the complexity of the organisation structure. Complex and internationally active banks cannot be easily wound up nor can their crucial functions be easily transferred to another party. Secondly, in a crisis situation, confidence effects and herding behaviour of market participants play a reinforcing role. 4 BIS Review 171/2010 
FSB Framework for SIFIs These contagion channels made bailouts of systemic institutions during the crisis inevitable. Such intervention, however, carries a number of problems, like a burden on fiscal position, creating moral hazard by making government guarantees explicit, and undermining the level playing-field between institutions. Therefore, steps have been taken to tackle the too-important-to-fail problem. The Financial Stability Board has developed a policy framework to deal with systemically important financial institutions, which the G20 World leaders ratified last month. This framework is designed to reduce the probability and impact of a failure of a SIFI. It rests on more intensive supervision, higher buffers for SIFIs compared to Basel III and an increased resolution capacity of national authorities. The case for macro-prudential oversight 20.  On top of these new standards and regulations, enhancing supervision is also vital. Macro-prudential oversight is, to put it simply, the missing link between the different approaches of a central bank and a financial supervisor. A central bank significantly promotes financial stability by aiming at low inflation, sound payment systems and sustainable credit growth. Supervisors exercise their responsibility for the stability of individual financial institutions by ensuring that they have adequate buffers to withstand shocks. The problem is that both responsibilities, although closely interrelated, have been poorly attuned. Let me explain. 21.  In the run-up to the crisis, most central banks warned against the risks to the financial system. But these warnings did not prove meaningful, as they were not effectively translated into mitigating action by supervisors. Likewise, most supervisors believed that if individual institutions were sound, the financial system as a whole would be too. However, the financial crisis has shown that supervision of individual institutions is important, but not sufficient to preserve financial stability. 22.  The message is clear: the supervision of the financial system as a whole should be strengthened to lower the chance and impact of future crises, and this requires central banks and supervisors to join forces. One important added value of macro-prudential oversight is that it looks at the interactions between financial institutions and their environment. A single bank, say, can exercise only a limited influence on housing prices. But, if many banks eased their credit standards for mortgage loans, housing prices could soar, possibly causing the housing market to overheat. A housing market crash can entail huge losses for the banking sector and the real economy. Thus, by monitoring the interactions within the financial system, including the dynamics behind a build-up of imbalances, macro-prudential oversight can identify threats to financial stability. In light of these lessons, the EU political authorities have decided to establish a new European Systemic Risk Board per 1 January 2011 to strengthen macro-prudential oversight in the EU. Conclusion 23.  Ladies and gentlemen, let me come to an end. I have talked about one of the most sweeping crises the financial world has been confronted with since a long time. Governments, supervisors and the financial sector worldwide have replied to this with ambitious measures and reforms. I am sure that many people, maybe even some among you, will question whether all these measures and initiatives will in the end improve the world? It is a simple and fair question, with no easy answer! And though I am no fortune teller, I firmly believe that these reforms will make the financial sector healthier, stabilise economies and so improve the world. 24.  And the need for these reforms is evident. A recent IMF study, for instance, estimates the costs of a financial crisis at around 15 percent of GDP, while research that BIS Review 171/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 171/2010 factors in the long-term impact of a crisis might easily arrive at a multiple of this figure. With the measures we discussed, future crises will become less probable. At the same time we should realise that this objective is not presented to us on a silver platter. All the parties involved will have to work hard to meet all the requirements now that implementation is the next challenge. So let us not wait too long, and start making plans instead. Thank you for your attention. 
Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: The crisis and financial markets Speech by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the Annual Financial Conference of the Asociación de Mercados Financieros, Madrid, 13 December 2010. *      *      * Good afternoon, and my thanks to the Asociación de Mercados Financieros for their kind invitation to participate in this lunch colloquium. Since the Great Depression last century, the world has not seen a financial crisis as deep as the present one. And, like then, many years of intense study and a sufficient time perspective will probably be needed to accurately assess the factors that caused the crisis and the mechanisms contributing to its spread. In particular, there is still much to be learned of the relationship between the development of the crisis and the behaviour of financial markets. Nonetheless, I shall take this opportunity today to offer some brief reflections on the conduct of markets during the crisis, with a perspective that in no way claims to be all-encompassing since I shall concern myself exclusively with its impact on the Spanish economy. To this end I’ll discuss two clearly differentiated episodes of the financial crisis of the past three years: the first, which we might call the “banking crisis”, affected Spain less than other countries; and the second, associated with the rapid deterioration of public finances in the euro area, has had significant effects on our country. The outbreak of the first phase of the crisis dates back over three years, when a European bank suspended redemptions of funds invested in US mortgage loans. It soon became apparent that the source of these problems lay in US subprime mortgages and in the spread of the associated risk via the “originate to distribute” model. Banks were hit hardest. Major financial institutions collapsed not only in the countries where the problems originated, but also in many others whose banks invested their savings in products generated by the more indebted economies. By contrast, the Spanish banking system had not originated or invested in this type of product, thanks largely to the relatively conservative approach behind our regulation and supervision. Consequently, although our banks were obviously not immune to some of the effects of the crisis, such as the deterioration in the economic situation or the consequences of the collapse in confidence on the workings of wholesale funding markets, the direct effect on the Spanish banking system was relatively minor.  During the long expansion prior to the crisis, there was a constant increase in the indebtedness of the Spanish economy, similar to that in other countries which, with the crisis, saw their banking systems collapse. Some analysts drew parallels with the events in these countries and warned that similar problems could arise in Spain. But this has not been the case. True, during the expansionary phase, private-sector debt grew at very high rates, although it should be clarified that the growth in asset prices – unwarranted by fundamentals – was less than in other countries. Yet during these three years the Spanish banking system has proven reasonably resilient; only two small entities had to be taken under central bank control, and the volume of public aid made available was very small compared with the public resources earmarked to this end in other countries. The explanation for this different outcome in apparently similar situations must be sought in the quality of banking regulation and supervision, and in the retail banking-based business model of banks in Spain. What happened was that the countries which saw their banking systems collapse were largely those which, in the preceding years, had most vigorously defended the benefits of a “hands-off” government approach to the functioning of the financial sector. This was quite the opposite of the approach of the Banco de España, a central bank that took to heart the lessons of the serious banking crises of the 1980s and early 1990s in Spain. BIS Review 171/2010 1 
Until the crisis erupted, the prevailing doctrine had advocated light-handed regulation, considering both our supervisory approach and our banking system’s business model, centred on traditional banking activities, as outmoded. But in the wake of the crisis, the pendulum has swung. Now the predominant approach in financial regulation has gone to the other extreme. Testifying to this is the work programme in place in the main international agencies and fora, such as the G20, the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  Intense work is under way to introduce major changes into the international regulatory and supervisory framework so as to prevent similar crises from recurring and to improve the financial system’s resilience moving forward. Such changes include most notably the new rules known as Basel III, which alter the regulation of the banking sector at the international level in several fundamental respects: banks will be required to have more and better-quality capital; explicit requirements will be made in respect of liquidity risk; and measures will be taken to mitigate the procyclical behaviour of financial activity. Further, the FSB is working on the treatment of systemic banks, i.e. those considered too important to fail due to their size, the level of complexity of their operations or their interconnectedness with other financial system participants. In future, these banks will have to meet greater regulatory and supervisory demands, which will need to be adapted to the type of activity, complexity and structure of each bank. Headway has been made and is being made in many other areas, such as remuneration in the financial sector, the regulation of rating agencies, etc. Generally speaking, Spain has much to learn from other countries about economic policies. The clearest and most pressing example, in light of the economic and social consequences of the burgeoning number of jobless Spaniards, is the employment and labour market policies of those countries which, even at the height of crises, keep unemployment rates low. However, within the realm of financial regulation and supervision policies, the opposite is the case: our supervisory arrangements are being closely studied for reforms in other countries. The ingenious idea of Governor Rojo and his team to set in place a countercyclical mechanism in order to try and soften credit growth or at least mitigate the adverse consequences of its cyclical behaviour on the banking system was a forerunner of the countercyclical capital buffers envisaged in the Basel III Accord. The constraints on complex products and the obligation to consolidate are further examples of rules or guidelines that are characteristic of Spanish banking supervision and regulation and which fully coincide with the direction in which global financial system reform is advancing. Spain’s approach to restructuring its banking sector has demonstrable advantages. The process has been undertaken using the FROB (Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking Sector), which was set up following Parliamentary approval over 18 months ago and has since overseen numerous integration processes between savings banks that have reduced their number from 45 to 17. The design of the FROB was based around a two-pronged approach. First, it was geared to supporting banks which, while viable, required restructuring to ensure their ability to resume a path of sustainable profitability, by reinforcing their solvency with public funds. Significantly, in certain countries where the need for a similar instrument has been acknowledged, this has not yet been created. Second, the FROB involved giving the Banco de España wide-ranging powers to swiftly and effectively take control and resolve the problems of those banks that are not viable.  Rounding off the remit of the FROB has been the approval of the reform of the legal regime for savings banks. To date, the limitations inherent in their legal status had prevented savings banks from reinforcing their core capital, except through the capitalisation of profits. The reform opens the way for savings banks to tap private capital by enabling them to issue core equity instruments, it provides for improvements in their management and it subjects them to greater market discipline.  Restructuring was considered on the basis of two criteria that have proven to be most useful. The first is the requirement that those banks applying for public aid should reduce capacity. 2 BIS Review 171/2010 
During the expansion, our banking system became excessively big in parallel with the growth of the construction sector. If aid had not been conditional upon the presentation of a capacity-adjustment programme, the profit and loss accounts of all banks would have continued to perform poorly, not only in conjunctural terms but also structurally. And as you know, the profit and loss account is the first line of defence when it comes to averting banking crises. Another criterion that has proven most useful relates to the substantial amount (up to €99 billion) authorised by Parliament to meet the recapitalisation needs that may arise during the crisis, but to contain in turn the budgetary impact of the restructuring process. The more than €10 billion that are to be lent to Spanish banks are no doubt a considerable sum. But it is actually a very small amount when compared with the outlay in other countries, which reacted by pumping towering amounts of public funds into private banks, leading to most serious increases in public debt that in some cases have ultimately caused problems for the country concerned. Where necessary, there are more than sufficient backstops to meet recapitalisation needs, but it is absurd to inject public funds unnecessarily. Let’s now turn to the role of financial markets in the second phase of the financial crisis, the so-called “sovereign debt crisis”, which erupted very recently, in spring this year. The behaviour of the sovereign bonds markets could be analysed from the standpoint of market failures or in how they are regulated. While this is an interesting perspective, proposals for reform on any major scale have not yet been set in train, unlike with banking regulation. The crisis has disclosed numerous shortcomings in the functioning of markets, and one frequent criticism is that these same markets influence the public policy agenda. But the fact of the matter is that hardly any far-reaching reforms such as those being drawn up for credit markets have been proposed. Those interested in this viewpoint should read the latest speech by Fernando Restoy, the vice-chairman of the CNMV (Spanish National Securities Market Commission). In it he suggests certain areas in which the regulation of these markets could be improved. I’m going to adopt a less ambitious approach, focusing on describing market behaviour from the standpoint of a country such as ours, which in recent months has had to tackle a lack of investor confidence. What have we learned from the behaviour of the debt markets in this second phase of the crisis? Perhaps one of the key lessons is that markets are capable of identifying certain structural problems which, for whatever reason, may affect an economy’s solvency. And this is why markets can offer us economic policy pointers, of interest not only to them but also to us. Restoring health to public finances, reforms to boost growth and reduce unemployment, the restructuring of our banking systems so they are positioned to promote growth when credit demand picks up, etc. are all pieces of advice of benefit to us and which are worth following.  Admittedly, some may say, markets issue warnings. But they usually do so belatedly. And this is true. Turning to Spain’s case, there was a more than 10-year-long boom during which credit hit double-digit growth rates and the current account, which was practically in balance in 1996, began to run a systematically and continuously widening deficit. Over this period the markets were not exactly profuse in giving signals about the imbalances that were building up. The markets, like Spaniards, thought the Spanish economy was doing fine. We should acknowledge, as Raghuram Rajan does when talking about the US economy, that this delay in realising the actual problems was shared by all agents in the economy. But that does not mean that, although they are late, the messages from markets do not merit being heard and given due assessment. If we think that investors’ evaluation of problems is reasonable, then the most recommendable response is to follow their advice. We’ve also learned that the markets may not only err when they are late offering their advice, but that their judgments may also be mistaken. Frequently, their information is diffuse or insufficient, and investors’ view of different economies is shaped in an overly simplistic BIS Review 171/2010 3 
fashion. What we’ve seen, when this is the case, is that criticising their ignorance is of little use in practical terms. The proper response is to provide them with the most and best information possible. Generally, when investors have the right information, they incorporate it appropriately into their judgments.  In all modesty, I think an example of an appropriate response to an incorrect diagnosis by the markets was our decision last summer to perform stress tests on all listed Spanish banks and savings banks. The markets’ doubts at that time about the Spanish system’s capacity to digest the real estate problem were unfounded. But once we reacted, transparently, the uncertainty dispelled, banks and savings banks were once again able to raise funds on markets and the recourse by our banks to ECB financing dropped dramatically. In this same vein of lessons learned, we’ve recently seen that the markets, in addition to not being infallible, also sometimes forget. The latest instance of this are the doubts that have emerged again about the Spanish banking system. The stress tests were performed at the end of July, and as you may well suppose, the value of Spanish banks’ real estate assets cannot have varied significantly in three months. Nothing has changed substantially in respect of the other assumptions made, and yet the markets appear to have forgotten this because they have adopted a line of logic that has it that if Ireland had a real estate problem and has serious banking problems, something similar might happen in Spain. This suspicion has been strengthened by the fact that Irish banks also passed the stress tests. In this respect, it should be underscored that the stress tests performed in Spain were more exhaustive and offered more detailed information. While in Ireland only two banks participated in the tests, in Spain all listed banks and savings banks took part and information was provided on the exposure to risks, real estate risk in particular, with a notably greater degree of detail and transparency than in other countries. But what is to be done when markets forget or investors’ doubts resurface? Once again in these cases, the medicine should be more transparency. This is why, in late November, we took the initiative of explaining again the situation and we once more laid bare Spanish banks, and savings banks in particular. We have asked banks to explain in detail their situation to the market. In particular, the Banco de España has given instructions to the related banking associations to ensure that institutions disclose standardised additional information on a quarterly basis to the market on their exposure to the real estate development and construction sector, detailing the percentages of doubtful loans, the related collateral and the provisions set aside to withstand their potential impairment. They also have to give details of their retail mortgage portfolio, including the related LTV ratios and the percentages of doubtful assets. Finally, they must assess their market funding needs and the short-, medium- and long-term strategies they have implemented. All this is necessary because when reality is perceived as being worse than it actually is, the best possible response is to explain it in the finest detail. A further lesson drawn from the conduct of markets is that they do not like uncertainty. As top film scriptwriters know, filmgoers are happiest when they can predict a little bit of what’s going to happen. Music composers also know this. The more unpredictable a film or a musical composition is, the more unsatisfied viewers and listeners are. In this debt crisis, in addition to the responsibility of the countries subjected to market mistrust, the lack of coordination among European Union leaders has also played a key role. In the public eye, the latter have aired substantial differences and have sometimes done so at the worst possible time in the crisis, thereby contributing to compounding the problems. I recall a journalist interviewing an analyst in a US TV programme some weeks back. The analysts set about discussing how Europe’s sovereign debt problems were the main source of instability at present worldwide. The journalists asked him how it was possible that, among the markets’ reasons for nervousness, he had not even mentioned the North Korean bombing incident the previous day. And the analyst replied: “Look, markets like predictable. And the North Korean government is much more predictable than European politicians”.  4 BIS Review 171/2010 
BIS Review 171/2010 5 What I have said about European Union institutions can also be extended to institutions within individual countries, where it is not only important what the central government says or does, but also what the regional governments, the opposition and, generally, all relevant economic agents do or say. And that’s something else we’ve learned about markets: they see us from afar and don’t distinguish what we distinguish within. Specifically, in our case, they do not always draw a distinction between regional and central governments, or between the government and the opposition. What they see is, simply, Spain. Taking these lessons on market behaviour to heart is very important for all countries, but all the more so in a country such as Spain which, owing to the systematic and growing build-up of current account deficits since 1996, has had to resort to external financing. Accordingly, it is vital to transmit confidence to those who finance us. We’re now moving in the right direction. In the space of three years we’ve moved from a current account deficit of around 10% of GDP to one below 5% this year. And in the case of the budget deficit, we’ll see a decline from over 11% last year to 6% next year. Once the adjustment is over, the Spanish economy will once again outgrow the biggest economies in the euro area, as foreseen by most international institutions. Yet we should not be complacent, but carry on pushing structural reforms through. You’ll have noted that the markets behave like people: sometimes they give reasonable advice, sometimes they do so late, sometimes they make mistakes, and sometimes they have a short memory. And they waver between greed and fear, depending on whether they’re preoccupied with returns or with risk. We’re now witnessing a “flight from risk”. But you’ll no doubt recall the frenzied “search for yield” on financial markets worldwide in the decade prior to the crisis.  Should we always heed the advice of the markets? Not necessarily. It’s highly recommendable to do so when their messages are sensible ones. And frequently, albeit belatedly, they demand we do what benefits us. But they also make mistakes occasionally and, in those cases, there’s no sense in our getting worked up and calling them ignorant. That serves no purpose. The right response is to offer them the most information possible and to explain to them our reasoning. This is how to convince somebody, and it is how we should react to the markets. Indeed, the markets are no more than people. That is why when I’m asked how we should react to them, my usual advice is to treat them like the people they ultimately are. Thank you. 
Guy Debelle: Bank funding and capital flows Speech by Mr Guy Debelle, Assistant Governor (Financial Markets) of the Reserve Bank of Australia, at the 23rd Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, 15 December 2010. *      *      * Thanks to Alex Heath, Chris Stewart and Crystal Ossolinski for their help in preparing this speech. The financial crisis has led to a significant re-assessment of risk. Having been underpriced for a number of years prior to 2007, risk was rapidly and substantially re-priced as the financial crisis unfolded. Counterparty risk came to the fore and there has also been a more fundamental re-assessment of the importance of liquidity risk. There is a new-found, or re-found, appreciation for the complex ways in which risk can affect the broader financial system.  Given the pivotal role of banks in the financial system, the evolution of the financial crisis has placed particular focus on them and the way they fund themselves. Because one of the main features of banking business is maturity transformation, banks were exposed to the realisation of a liquidity shock. Problems associated with liquidity (or more precisely the lack of it) proved to be an important channel for shocks in one part of the financial system to be propagated to others.  The re-assessment and the re-pricing of these risks have caused changes in the structure of funding of Australian banks. Today, I will discuss these developments on the liability side of banks’ balance sheets. But at the same time, there have also been changes on the asset side of their balance sheets, with credit growth slowing significantly, particularly lending to large businesses. The combination of these changes, together with the investment-focused growth of the Australian economy, has had a marked effect on the composition of capital flows to Australia which I will discuss later in my talk. These developments may well persist for quite some time to come.  Bank funding1 The re-pricing of risk significantly increased the cost of wholesale funding for the global banking system. At the shorter end of the yield curve, the rise in costs primarily reflected counterparty concerns. This is best exemplified by the spread between a short-term rate in the interbank market and the expected policy rate (Graph 1). As has been noted in the past, this spread serves as one of the better summary illustrations of the evolution of the financial crisis.  In Australia, this spread never rose as much as it did in other countries, reflecting the general absence of counterparty concerns and the associated smoother functioning of the interbank market throughout most of the crisis. As Graph 1 shows, this spread has fallen back in Australia to be not far above its pre-crisis levels: pre-crisis the 90-day spread averaged around 10 basis points, now it is around 20 basis points. It is not surprising this spread has narrowed so far. By and large, one would expect that in more stable times, counterparty concerns would be reasonably absent over shorter horizons and so not much of a risk premium should be present in the pricing. But when counterparty concerns are rising, they tend to be rapidly incorporated into this spread.                                                   1  For more detail on bank funding, see the Reserve Bank of Australia submission to the Senate Economics References Committee Inquiry into Competition within the Australian Banking Sector, 30 November 2010. BIS Review 171/2010 1 
Graph 1   At longer terms, the effect of this repricing of risk is much more stark and, while pricing has eased back from its peaks, it still remains well above its pre-crisis levels (Graph 2). The overall cost to a major Australian bank of issuing a three-year bond has risen to around 120 basis points over the government bond yield compared with around 50 basis points pre-crisis. Graph 2 shows that similar, but larger, developments have occurred in other banking sectors.  Graph 2  2 BIS Review 171/2010 
In addition to this effect on the pricing of wholesale funding, the re-assessment of risk has had a marked impact on the structure of banks’ funding (Graph 3). Banks, their regulators and markets have re-assessed the riskiness of different sources of funding, particularly liquidity risk and the related concept of rollover risk. This change in perspective is embodied in the new Basel standards for the banking system.  Graph 3   One notable change is the rise in the share of deposits from less than 40 per cent in 2007 to over 45 per cent currently. The Deputy Governor Ric Battellino talked about this at this conference last year.2 The desire to increase the share of deposits reflects the assumption that deposits represent a more stable source of funding.  In order to boost their share of deposit funding, banks in Australia have competed aggressively in terms of price. An indication of the degree of competition for deposits is the extent to which there has been an increase in the cost of deposit funding relative to the cash rate since mid 2008: the average cost of the major banks’ new deposits is now only slightly below the cash rate, whereas prior to the onset of the financial crisis, deposit rates were about 150 basis points below the cash rate (Graph 4).                                                  2  See Battellino R (2009), “Some Comments on Bank Funding”, Remarks to the 22nd Australasian Finance and Banking Conference, Sydney, 16 December 2009. BIS Review 171/2010 3 
Graph 4   Competition has been strongest for term deposits. The average rate on banks’ term deposit specials is currently more than 70 basis points above market rates for debt of equivalent terms (Graph 5). In the few years prior to the global financial crisis the average rate was generally about 60 basis points below. This is notwithstanding the fact that wholesale debt is a liquid tradable instrument whereas a deposit is not; one might expect that this liquidity of wholesale debt would result in it being cheaper.  Graph 5  4 BIS Review 171/2010 
Rates on at-call savings deposits – including bonus saver, cash management and online savings accounts – have also risen relative to the cash rate. The average rate on the major banks’ at-call deposits, which account for a little under half of their total deposits, is currently estimated to be around 40 basis points below the cash rate compared to around 100 basis points below in mid 2007.  So the bottom line of all of this is that the deposit market has been extremely competitive. The most marked increase in competition occurred late last year and the early part of this year. Since then, our liaison suggests that competitive pressures have not intensified further but nevertheless they remain at a high level. As Ric Battellino noted last year, at some point, it is likely that the elasticity of deposits to price declines. This means further increases in prices result in the banks mostly shuffling the deposits between themselves, rather than generating further increases in the share of funds investors allocate to deposits.  At the same time as banks have increased the share of deposit funding by around 7 percentage points, the share of longer-term wholesale funding has also increased by a similar amount. This increase in the share of funding sourced from deposits and long-term debt has mirrored a decline in the share of funding sourced from short-term wholesale debt, both from domestic and foreign markets. The share of short-term funding has fallen by 10 percentage points over the past three years, a very large change indeed.  As a result of these changes, the vulnerability of the Australian banking system to any further seizures in global financial markets has decreased. But these changes have increased the cost of funding for the banking system as a whole. The costs of all forms of funding have risen, and, at the same time, banks have shifted to more expensive sources of funding. As I said earlier, this shift has reflected market and regulatory pressures following a re-assessment of risk.  The re-pricing of risk has increased the cost of intermediation from its pre-crisis level, when it was arguably underpriced. This rise in the cost of intermediation is reflected in the increase in lending rates relative to the cash rate.3 The financial crisis also raised awareness of the other sources of risk for the global banking sector. For a number of European banks, the currency and maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities raised significant issues throughout the crisis and continues to be a vulnerability. The fact that this issue is ongoing has been reflected in the recent rise in the EUR/USD cross currency basis swap. In contrast, the Australian banks hedged the currency risk of their offshore borrowing using instruments that were maturity matched. As a result they did not face the issues that some European banks faced of funding US dollar assets from a euro funding base.  The US dollar swap lines that a number of central banks, including the RBA, established with the Federal Reserve were established in large part to alleviate these stresses stemming from the European banking system. As their funding was being severely curtailed from other sources, the European banks turned to the swap market to fund their long-dated and illiquid US dollar asset positions. This demand from European banks for US dollars each day, at the same time as supply was being reduced, caused the price of US dollars to rise dramatically in all markets and time zones.4                                                   3  Again, more details on this are in the Reserve Bank of Australia submission to the Senate Economics References Committee Inquiry into Competition within the Australian Banking Sector, 30 November 2010. 4  For more information, see “The Functioning and Resilience of Cross-border Funding Markets”, CGFS Papers No 37, March 2010. BIS Review 171/2010 5 
The RBA participated in the swap line to help distribute US dollars into this time zone (the Bank of Japan’s participation served a similar purpose).5 It did not reflect any issue with the Australian banking system’s own need for US dollars. The funds provided under the swap line were cheaper than the extremely wide market price at the time. As a result, Australian based banks availed themselves of this and in a number of cases on-lent the funds to banks in other jurisdictions. The provision of these funds globally alleviated the strains in the swap market and the spread declined. Once it declined below the price of the swap line, demand in Australia dried up and the facility was no longer offered here, although it continued to attract demand for a longer period of time in other markets.  Bank’s assets While these developments have been taking place on the liability (funding) side of banks’ balance sheets, there have been some interesting developments on the asset side too.  Since mid 2008, there has been a significant easing in the pace of credit growth, particularly for the business sector (Graph 6). Further disaggregation indicates that the easing in credit growth has been most striking for large businesses (Graph 7).   Graph 6                                                   5  The Fed has recently published details of these transactions, along with that of all its other programs. See http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/reform_swaplines.htm. The RBA's participation in this program was made available to the market in real time. For more details see the Operations in Financial Markets section of the RBA 2009 Annual Report. 6 BIS Review 171/2010 
Graph 7    The decline in credit outstanding to large businesses reflects a number of factors:   Some businesses have found it more cost effective to access funds directly from the market rather than through the banking system.   In 2009, there was a record level of equity raisings by large businesses that enabled them to repay debt (Graph 8).   There has been a tightening in lending standards for some sectors, most notably commercial property.   A number of large businesses, particularly in the mining sector, have been able to fund their activities and repay debt from their retained earnings resulting from their strong cash flow (Graph 9).  Looking forward, given the expected prominence of resource investment for GDP growth, it is quite possible this pattern of subdued business credit growth relative to robust growth in the economy might persist. The RBA’s forecasts have investment increasing as a share of the economy in the period ahead to historic highs. Much (although not all) of this pick-up in investment is in the resources sector. The companies undertaking this investment tend to be much less reliant on credit intermediated through the domestic banking system. Instead they are likely to fund a sizeable share of this investment from global capital markets either through direct raisings or syndicated loans.  BIS Review 171/2010 7 
Graph 8    Graph 9   8 BIS Review 171/2010 
This slowdown in growth on the asset side of the balance sheet has alleviated pressures on banks to increase their funding. Over the past couple of years, credit growth has been slower than the growth in deposits for the first time the early 1990s (Graph 10).  Graph 10   As mentioned earlier, part of the explanation for the strong growth in deposits is the increased competition for deposits in the banking system. But another part of the explanation reflects the changed nature of the financial flows in the economy. While parts of the corporate sector may be less reliant on the domestic banking system for their funding, ultimately a large part of the funding they raise from other sources still finds its way into the domestic banking system in the form of corporate deposits. Hence, if the economy evolves as forecast, it’s quite possible this pattern of deposit growth outstripping credit growth continues and deposits may continue to rise as a share of bank funding.  Bank funding and capital flows  These changes in bank funding, as well as in the funding of the increase in capital expenditure, are apparent in the financial accounts side of the balance of payments. These are the capital inflows that are the counterpart of the current account deficit.  The net capital inflow into Australia masks very large gross capital flows both into and out of the country. For example, over the past five years, the average annual net capital inflow amounted to $55 billion. This net capital inflow comprised:   foreign investment in Australian equity of $54 billion;   Australian investment in foreign equity of $51 billion;  foreign investment in Australian debt of $95 billion; and  Australian investment in foreign debt instruments of $43 billion. BIS Review 171/2010 9 
Given the size of these gross flows, it can be somewhat misleading to analyse shifts in capital flows or how the current account deficit is funded by focusing on net flows only.  For a number of years prior to 2007, Australian banks were a steady source of capital inflow, representing around 4 per cent of GDP, or around 80 per cent of net private sector inflow (Graph 11). These capital inflows reflected the fact that Australian banks found it cost effective to raise wholesale funds offshore to fund domestic asset growth. That these net flows into the banking sector were similar in size to the current account was as much coincidence as causation in my opinion.  Graph 11   Given the changes to bank funding and the slowdown in the credit growth discussed above, financial inflows in the form of offshore debt raisings by Australian financial institutions have declined. In the first three quarters of 2010, the net inflow of foreign funding to banks was only 1 per cent of GDP. All of this occurred in the first quarter of the year, with the net amount of offshore funding by the banking sector amounting to zero in the two most recent quarters. At the same time, the current account deficit has fallen to around 2½ per cent of GDP.  Going forward, the forecast rise in the investment share of the economy is likely to see an increase in capital inflows. As discussed above, given that mining companies are likely to rely less on locally intermediated debt to fund their activities, there are likely to be further changes in the composition of net private capital inflows away from banks towards non-financial corporates. Some of this might be in the form of increased direct debt raisings, some might be in the form of an increase in retained earnings. So the current account deficit may increase from its current level, but on the capital account side, there may not be a concomitant increase in banks’ net offshore raisings. 10 BIS Review 171/2010 
BIS Review 171/2010 11 Conclusion  The financial crisis has had a marked impact on financial flows globally. In this speech I have described some of the effects it has had on financial flows in the Australian economy. The funding of the Australian banking system has changed quite markedly as has the cost of that funding. In addition, the forecast composition of growth in the Australian economy and the funding of that growth may have implications for the asset side of the banking system’s balance sheet. It is quite possible that intermediated credit growth will be slower, and deposit growth relatively higher, than has been the case in recent years. These changes have been, and may continue to be, reflected in the changed composition of capital flows to the Australian economy. 
Mark Carney: Living with low for long Remarks by Mr Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of Canada, at the Economic Club of Canada, Toronto, 13 December 2010. *   *   * Introduction  I would like to thank the Economic Club of Canada for this opportunity to reflect on the current economic and financial trends. I am sure many in this room would like me to stop at the title, “Living with Low for Long,” so you can go merrily into the Christmas holidays, content that I have just provided an early present of extraordinary guidance on future Canadian monetary policy. However, I am not bearing gifts today. Canadian monetary policy will continue to be set, as it has in the past, for overall Canadian conditions and guided by our 2 per cent inflation target.  In my remarks today, I will focus on the factors that have led to a low-interest-rate environment in major advanced economies, and the implications of this environment for financial stability and economic growth.  Global economic outlook  Current turbulence in Europe is a reminder that the crisis is not over, but has merely entered a new phase. In a world awash with debt, repairing the balance sheets of banks, households and countries will take years. As a consequence, the pace, pattern and variability of global economic growth is changing, and Canada must adapt.  For the crisis economies, the easy bit of the recovery is now finished. Temporary factors supporting growth in 2010 – such as the turn in the inventory cycle and the release of pent-up demand – have largely run their course. Fiscal stimulus is turning to fiscal drag and, for some countries, rapid consolidation has become urgent. Household expenditure can be expected to recover only slowly. This all implies a gradual absorption of the large excess capacity in many advanced economies.  This is not surprising. History suggests that recessions involving financial crises tend to be deeper and have recoveries that take twice as long. In the decade following severe financial crises, growth rates tend to be one percentage point lower and unemployment rates five percentage points higher.1 The current U.S. recovery is proving no exception.  In such an environment, very low policy rates in the major advanced economies could be in place for a prolonged period – a possibility underscored by the recent extensions of unconventional monetary policies in the United States, Japan and Europe.  This tendency towards low-interest rates is being reinforced by structural forces. The global economy is rapidly becoming multi-polar, with emerging-market economies now driving commodity prices, representing almost one-half of all import growth, and accounting for about two-thirds of global growth.  This is an increasingly uneasy emergence. Growth strategies reliant on exports and excess national savings are unsustainable in the long term. In the near term, for many emerging economies, the limits to non-inflationary growth are approaching and the challenges of shadowing U.S. monetary policy are increasing.                                                   1  See C. Reinhart and V. Reinhart, “After the Fall,” Macroeconomic Challenges: The Decade Ahead, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 2010 Economic Policy Symposium. Available at: http://www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/reinhart-paper.pdf.  BIS Review 170/2010 1 
With currency tensions rising, some fear a repeat of the competitive devaluations of the Great Depression. However, the current situation is actually more perverse. In the 1930s, countries left the gold standard in order to ease monetary policy, and the system became more flexible.  Today, the process is working in reverse. The international monetary system is sliding towards a massive dollar block. Over a dozen countries are now accumulating reserves at double digit annual rates, and countries representing over 40 per cent of the U.S.-dollar trade weight are now managing their currencies.  This death grip on the U.S. dollar is reducing the prospects for rebalancing global demand. As the Bank of Canada has argued elsewhere, the potential costs are huge – to $7 trillion in lost global output by 2015.2 Ultimately, excessive reserve accumulation will prove futile. Structural changes in the global economy will yield important adjustments in real exchange rates. If nominal exchange rates do not change, the adjustment will come through inflation in emerging economies and disinflation in major advanced economies.  This more wrenching adjustment has already begun, raising the risk of debt deflation and deficient global demand. At a minimum, this dynamic reinforces the low-interest-rate strategies of major advanced economies and may necessitate further rounds of quantitative easing.  So what does this mean for countries caught in the middle, like Canada? I will review three aspects:   the effect of the second round of quantitative easing (QE2);   the implications for Canadian monetary policy; and   the potential financial stability implications of “low for long” interest rates.  QE2 and implications for Canada  Last month, the Federal Reserve launched a new program to buy US$600 billion in longer-term treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.3  It is doing so because, even though its policy rate has been effectively zero for two years, the Fed is still missing both legs of its dual mandate to foster price stability and maximum employment. Core inflation is at an all-time low and unemployment is unusually high. The spectre of large structural unemployment threatens.  QE2 is designed to support the economy through easier financial conditions. In theory, by putting downward pressure on longer-term U.S.-Treasury rates, the program stimulates interest-sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and business investment. Portfolio rebalancing should encourage investors to shift towards riskier assets such as corporate debt and equities. This in turn increases financial wealth, which supports spending. In contrast, some financial investment may shift to harder assets such as commodities, which would reduce the disposable incomes of Americans.                                                   2  See M. Carney, “Restoring Faith in the International Monetary System,” speech delivered to Spruce Meadows Changing Fortunes Round Table, Calgary, Alberta, 10 September 2010. Available at:   http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2010/sp100910.html. 3  It will also reinvest maturing existing holdings amounting to about US$250 billion to US$300 billion. 2 BIS Review 170/2010 
The exchange rate is another important channel. As returns on U.S. assets fall, investors could seek alternative investments outside the country, weakening the currency, boosting exports and curbing imports.  Finally, and importantly, expectations of higher growth should help increase inflation expectations towards a range consistent with the Fed’s mandate. This keeps real interest rates down, which encourages investment and spending.  Of course, the exact impact of the program is hard to discern as QE2 is not the only news in financial markets. Since the policy was first mooted by Chairman Bernanke in August, all the expected effects have been evident, supporting the Fed’s rationale. Since the November announcement, U.S. financial conditions have improved only slightly, reflecting the conflicting forces of some better U.S. data, heightened risk aversion caused by the European turmoil, possibly revised expectations regarding the ultimate size of the program, and the announcement of a major new fiscal package. The overall impact of QE2 may be more modest than previous interventions when market dislocations were more severe.4 The Bank of Canada anticipated the Fed’s latest move when we published our October projection (not hard to do, given the openness with which the Fed discussed its plans). Overall, we expect the net impact on Canadian GDP to be positive but small. This balances the impact of stronger U.S. growth on demand for Canadian goods and services, as well as on our terms of trade, with the possibility of further drag on non-commodity exports arising from the persistent strength of the Canadian dollar.  Canadian monetary policy  While the Canadian economy is importantly affected by developments in its largest trading partner, Canadian monetary policy is set for overall Canadian conditions and is guided by our 2 per cent inflation target. Given that the United States was the epicentre of the financial crisis and that the Canadian financial system has continued to function well, it is not surprising that our two economies have performed very differently. It is entirely appropriate that our monetary policies have diverged somewhat.  Consider the responses to the extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus enacted in the wake of the crisis.   Canadian output has now surpassed its pre-crisis peak (a situation unique in the G-7).   Canadian final domestic demand has grown by 5.7 per cent since the trough of the crisis – more than twice the rate (2.6 per cent) in the United States.   The Canadian economy recovered all of the jobs lost in the recession and added a further 23,700; the U.S. economy has recovered only one-tenth of jobs lost, while over 40 per cent of unemployed workers have now been out of work for more than half a year.   Household credit has grown by about 7 per cent in Canada since the trough in GDP; in the United States, it has fallen by 3.5 per cent.                                                   4  Research suggests that the first round of quantitative easing in 2009 was successful in improving market functioning and lowering long-term rates by 30-100 basis points in the United States and up to 100 basis points in the United Kingdom. See J. Gagnon, M. Raskin, J. Remache, and B. Sack, “Large-Scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” (Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 441, March 2010) and M. Joyce, A. Lasaosa, I. Stevens and M. Tong, “The Financial Market Impact of Quantitative Easing” (Bank of England Working Paper No. 393, August 2010). BIS Review 170/2010 3 
 The most recent rates of core inflation were 1.8 per cent in Canada versus 0.6 per cent in the United States.  It is not all good news. The weak links in the Canadian economy have been poor productivity growth and declining export competitiveness. As the Bank has emphasised in recent months, a rotation of demand from household expenditures to business investment and net exports will be important to a sustained Canadian expansion. In this regard, much remains to be done.  Since the spring, the Bank has unwound the last of its exceptional liquidity measures, removed the conditional commitment, and raised the overnight rate from 0.25 per cent to 1 per cent. Last week, the Bank maintained its target for the overnight rate at this level.  This decision leaves considerable monetary stimulus in place, consistent with achieving the 2 per cent inflation target in an environment of significant excess supply in Canada. Any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be carefully considered.  Historically low policy rates, even if appropriate to achieve the inflation target, create their own risks. Aside from monetary policy, Canadian authorities will need to remain as vigilant as they have been in the past to the possibility of financial imbalances developing in an environment of still-low interest rates and relative price stability.  I would like to spend the balance of my time on the more general issue of how the perception of low rates for long could potentially distort behaviour in public, financial, corporate and household sectors.  Implications for sovereigns  In some countries, low interest rates may delay necessary fiscal consolidation.5 By shifting their debt profile towards shorter-term financing, governments reduce interest rate payments. The substantial purchases of longer-term government bonds by foreign and domestic central banks could delay market signals about debt sustainability.6 While low current interest rates create short-term fiscal flexibility, they expose budgets to any increase in policy rates and abrupt changes in private market sentiment. Countries would be wise to heed the lessons learned by Canada in the 1990s: the bond market is there until it is not.  Implications of low for long for the financial sector  The conviction that interest rates will be low for long can lead to various types of risky behaviour in the financial sector.  As we have all just been reminded at great cost, an extended period of stability breeds complacency among financial market participants as risk-taking adapts to the perceived new equilibrium.7 Indeed, risk appears to be at its greatest when measures of it are at their lowest. Low variability of inflation and output (reduces current financial value at risk and) encourages greater risk-taking (on a forward value-at-risk basis). Investors stretch from liquid to less-liquid markets and large asset-liability mismatches are stretched across credit and currency markets.                                                   5  This is why it is important to adhere to the Toronto G-20 commitment to halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize debt to GDP by 2016. 6  Estimates of central bank ownership of U.S. Treasuries and U.K. gilts are both now over 40 per cent. 7  Either perceptions of risk or risk preferences could change. In the former case, complacency about actual risks can mean taking greater risks within the same risk budget. 4 BIS Review 170/2010 
These dynamics helped compress spreads and boost asset prices in the run-up to the crisis. They also made financial institutions increasingly vulnerable to a sudden reduction in both market and funding liquidity.8  The crisis prompted a brutal reversal, culminating in the panic in the autumn of 2008.  The period ahead will be somewhat different. In particular, perceptions of macroeconomic risk are more volatile, which should help limit complacency.9 Nonetheless, some of the risky dynamics associated with perceptions of an extended period of low interest rates could still be at work going forward.  For example, over the past year and a half, banks have used low short-term funding rates to rebuild capital by investing in long-term government bonds.10 This strategy is effective to a point, provided complacency does not set in over the duration of low policy rates. Making consistent positive carry may diminish the sense of urgency with which banks reduce leverage or write down bad assets. Financial institutions may also take this game too far, underestimating the risks. This is a particular concern since banks have considerably shortened the term structure of their funding in the aftermath of the crisis. Banks would do well to remember that marginal adjustments of interest rates have non-negligible effects when leverage is high.  A prolonged period of low interest rates also has important implications for insurance companies and pension funds with their longer-term guaranteed returns or benefits. By reducing yields on assets and raising the net present value of liabilities, a sustained period of low interest rates makes these guarantees harder to fulfill. To address potential shortfalls, funds could move into riskier assets in a search for yield and/or shorten their duration to limit asset-liability mismatches.11  The extent of these strategies will depend on accounting treatment of liabilities and regulatory arrangements. Some new proposals such as the recent International Accounting Standards Board’s proposed amendments to accounting standards for insurance contracts (IFRS 4) could have far-reaching systemic implications. The Bank correspondingly welcomes the Chairman’s recent decision to consider other options to improve the transparency and international comparability of insurance accounting.  Implications for the corporate sector  Low rates for an extended period of time reduce the incentives for banks to enforce the terms of loans and for firms themselves to adjust.  Past experience has shown that low policy rates allow “evergreening,” or the rolling-over of non-viable loans. The classic example was Japan in the 1990s when banks permitted debtors to roll over loans on which they could afford the near zero interest payments but not                                                  8  See M.K. Brunnermeier and L.H. Pedersen, “Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity,” Review of Financial Studies, 2009 22(6):2201–2238. 9  An analysis of the factors driving the weekly rates of return on a wide range of assets suggests that, since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, a higher proportion of the overall variation in weekly asset returns can be explained by a common factor. See Bank of Canada, Financial System Review, December, 2010. 10  The expectations channel is important because it determines the term spread, net-interest margin and forward-looking capitalization (accrual) of the banks. See T. Adrian and H.S. Shin, “Financial Intermediaries, Financial Stability and Monetary Policy,” a paper prepared for the symposium, “Maintaining Stability in a Changing Financial System,” Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August, 2008. 11  To some extent, insurance companies are sheltered from the immediate effects given the longer-term nature of their obligations as well as penalties on the withdrawals of existing plans that can be sizeable. BIS Review 170/2010 5 
principal repayments. By evergreening loans instead of writing them off, banks preserved their capital, but this delayed necessary restructuring of industry. Moreover, the presence of non-viable (or “zombie”) firms limited competition, reduced investment and prevented the entry of new enterprises.12 Here in Canada, the risk of such delayed adjustment is relatively modest at present since most Canadian corporate balance sheets are in outstanding shape. Corporate leverage declined in the third quarter of 2010 – approaching its lowest level in two decades – and it remains significantly below that in the United States, the United Kingdom and the euro area. However, it is possible that a mild form of such behaviour could develop in some sectors such as homebuilding, where land values may be slow to adjust to new realities. At present, low carrying costs provide powerful incentives for developers to wait out the current softness.  Unfortunately, the best contemporary analogue to the Japanese zombie firms is probably the U.S. household sector. Problems with the foreclosure process, government programs and forbearance by lenders are all delaying the adjustments.13 Absent more aggressive restructuring, the impact of negative equity on one-quarter of U.S. homeowners will weigh on consumption for the foreseeable future.  Implications for households  Encouraged in part by low interest rates, Canadian household credit has expanded rapidly during the recession and throughout the recovery. As a consequence, the proportion of households with stretched financial positions has grown significantly.  In a series of analyses over the past year the Bank has found that Canadian households are increasingly vulnerable to an adverse shock and that this vulnerability is rising more quickly than had been previously anticipated.14, 15 While there are welcome signs of moderation in the pace of debt accumulation by households, credit continues to grow faster than income. In some regions, lower house prices have begun to weigh on personal net worth. Without a significant change in behaviour, the proportion of households that would be susceptible to serious financial stress from an adverse shock will continue to grow.  The Bank has conducted a partial stress-testing simulation to estimate the impact on household balance sheets of a hypothetical labour market shock. The results suggest that the rise in financial stress from a 3-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate would double the proportion of loans that are in arrears three months or more. Owing to the declining affordability of housing and the increasingly stretched financial positions of households, the probability of a negative shock to property prices has risen as well.  Even if the growth in debt continues to slow, the vulnerability of Canadian households is unlikely to decline quickly given the outlook for subdued growth in income. In addition, private consumption is unlikely to be bolstered by gains in house prices going forward.                                                   12  “Low Interest Rates: Do the Risks Outweigh the Rewards?” Bank for International Settlements Annual Report 2009/2010, Chapter III. 13  Governor Kevin Warsh of the Federal Reserve rightly notes: “The steep correction in [U.S.] housing markets, while painful, lays the foundation for recovery – far better than the countless programs that sought to subsidize and temporize the inevitable repricing,” from the speech, “Rejecting the Requiem,” delivered to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, New York, New York, 8 November 2010. 14  Bank of Canada Financial System Review, June 2010 and December 2009. 15  This analysis was conducted using data from the Canadian Financial Monitor survey by Ipsos Reid Canada. 6 BIS Review 170/2010 
Lines of defence  Experience suggests that prolonged periods of unusually low rates can cloud assessments of financial risks, induce a search for yield, and delay balance-sheet adjustments. There are several defences.  The first line of defence is built on the decisions of individuals, companies, banks and governments.  The Bank’s advice to Canadians has been consistent. We have weathered a severe crisis – one that required extraordinary fiscal and monetary measures. Extraordinary measures are only a means to an end. Ordinary times will eventually return and, with them, more normal interest rates and costs of borrowing. It is the responsibility of households to ensure that in the future, they can service the debts they take on today.  Similarly, financial institutions are responsible for ensuring that their clients can service their debts.  More broadly, market participants should resist complacency and constantly reassess risks. Low rates today do not necessarily mean low rates tomorrow. Risk reversals when they happen can be fierce: the greater the complacency, the more brutal the reckoning.  The second line of defence is enhanced supervision of risk-taking activities. Stress testing in major economies should focus on excessive maturity and currency mismatches, look for evidence of forbearance (such as ailing industries receiving a disproportionate share of loans or the loosening of standards for existing debtors) and analyse the impact of sharp moves in yield curves.  These efforts will be aided by the imposition of the new Basel III regulations. Measures, including a leverage ratio, new trading book rules and liquidity standards, will help curtail excessive leverage and maturity transformation.  The third line of defence is the development of and selected use of macro-prudential measures. In funding markets, the introduction of through-the-cycle margining can help curtail liquidity cycles.16 In broader asset markets, counter-cyclical capital buffers can be deployed to lean against excess credit creation. Importantly, following the agreement of G-20 leaders in Seoul, the Basel Committee endorsed the Canadian-led proposal for this framework.17 In the housing market, the Canadian government has already taken important measures to address household leverage. These include a more stringent qualifying test that requires all borrowers to meet the standards for a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage as well as a reduction in the maximum loan-to-value ratio of refinanced mortgages and a higher minimum down payment on properties not occupied by the owner. In addition, the Bank of Canada’s interest rate increases reminded households of the interest rate risks they face. These measures are beginning to have an impact.  Canadian authorities are co-operating closely and will continue to monitor the financial situation of the household sector.  These defences should go a long way to mitigate the risk of financial excesses. But the question remains whether there will still be cases where, in order to best achieve long-run                                                  16  See “The Role of Margin Requirements and Haircuts in Procyclicality,” a report prepared by a study group chaired by David Longworth and published by the Committee on the Global Financial System of the Bank for International Settlements, 23 March 2010.

8 BIS Review 170/2010 price stability, monetary policy should play a supporting role by taking pre-emptive actions against building financial imbalances. As part of our research for the renewal of the inflation-control agreement, the Bank is examining this issue. While the bar for further changes remains high, the Bank has the responsibility to draw the appropriate lessons from the experience of others who, in an environment of price stability, reaped financial disaster.  Conclusion  These are extraordinary times. A massive deleveraging has barely begun across the industrialised world.  Canada entered this crisis extremely well-positioned. Due to the sacrifice of Canadians and the foresight of successive governments, our public debt burden was the lowest in the G-7. Thanks to the courage of my predecessors, monetary policy had tremendous credibility. Due to the quality of public supervision and private risk management, our banks had one of the soundest capital bases in the world. And after more than a decade of success, our corporate balance sheets were in great shape.  By combining these strengths with decisive policy actions, we have managed well through the turmoil. But the challenges we face have only just begun.  Cheap money is not a long-term growth strategy. Monetary policy will continue to be set to achieve the inflation target. Our institutions should not be lulled into a false sense of security by current low rates.  Households need to be prudent in their borrowing, recognising that over the life of a mortgage, interest rates will often be much higher.  The weight of the adjustment beyond our shores means that demand for our products is weak and competition fierce. We must improve our competitiveness. Recovery after a recession demands that capital and labour be reallocated. The surge in business investment that began this past summer can only be the start.  Now is not the time for complacency.  Thank you. 
Norman T L Chan: SME Financing Guarantee Scheme  Opening address by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Deputy Chairman of the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited, at the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme signing ceremony, Hong Kong SAR, 13 December 2010. *   *   * Good morning, I am very pleased to welcome all of you to today’s Letter of Intent Signing Ceremony for the launch of the SME (small to medium-sized enterprise) Financing Guarantee Scheme by the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation (“HKMC”).  SMEs are an important pillar of the Hong Kong economy and employment. In 2008, the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused credit crunch and market dislocation around the world. To mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis, the Hong Kong SAR Government swiftly rolled out a series of measures to “stabilise the financial system, support enterprises and preserve employment”. A key measure to help the SMEs was the launch of the $100 billion Special Loan Guarantee Scheme in December 2008. By October this year, the scheme has helped more than 20,000 companies, with the approved loan amount exceeding $98 billion, and helping to secure more than 330,000 jobs.  With the recovery of the local economy and the improved financing and cash flows for SMEs, the Special Loan Guarantee Scheme will cease to receive applications from early next year. Since May this year, many SMEs and think-tanks suggested that Hong Kong should develop a market-oriented platform to guarantee SME loans upon the phasing out of the Special Loan Guarantee Scheme. This suggestion has gained a good measure of support from the market and society at large. The HKMC therefore immediately launched an in-depth study and market consultation exercise. In mid-November, the HKMC announced that it will launch the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme on 1 January next year.  The Scheme will offer extensive and flexible guarantee coverage to help the SMEs in Hong Kong obtain more sustainable bank financing for their daily operations or purchase of equipment etc. Also, this Scheme will help banks manage their lending risks more effectively – the banks can meet the financing needs of the SMEs without having to warehouse excessive credit risks. Undoubtedly, the Scheme will bring benefits for the SMEs, banks, economy and employment in Hong Kong. We do not expect an overwhelming demand for the new Scheme initially. However, the global market conditions change and turn all the time. There is a high degree of volatility and uncertainty in the future. The business and financing environments for the enterprises could easily come under stress and the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme will then play an important role to help banks maintain a steady and sustainable flow of financing to the SMEs. To promote the launch of this new Scheme, the HKMC will offer a special discount for applications filed on or before 30 June 2011. There will be a waiver of three months’ guarantee fee for loans with tenor of one to three years and a waiver of six months’ guarantee fee for loans with tenor of more than three years. Lastly, let me thank once again the senior representatives of the 21 banks for participating in today’s Signing Ceremony. We stand ready to work with the banking industry to jointly promote this project which is so meaningful for the SMEs and the local economy. Thank you! BIS Review 170/2010 1 
Jean-Pierre Landau: Rebalancing the world economy – a common challenge Keynote address by Mr Jean-Pierre Landau, Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of France, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Economic Forum, Beijing, 11 November 2010. *   *   * In preparing those remarks, I was very influenced by the works by Ricardo Caballero and Raghuram Rajan (see references) among others. All interpretations and errors are mine. Great changes are taking place in the world economy. The center of gravity is moving to Asia and the emerging world. This has been recognized in the landmark agreement on IMF reform reached at the last G20 Ministerial meeting. China has become the IMF’s third shareholder, India has moved up by five ranks and Brazil is now on par with Canada (a G7 country). Symmetrically, the European representation in the Board will be reduced by the equivalent of two chairs (out of nine currently held). At the same time, we are facing great challenges. Output is growing fast in emerging economies but this relative shift in production has not been fully matched by a rebalancing in demand. Overall, beyond the turbulences caused by “hot money”, net capital flows are going “uphill” from emerging to developed economies. That means that some of the poorest citizens of the world are lending money to some of the richest, allowing those to finance their consumption. And financial bubbles have tended to proliferate in an environment of permanently low inflation and ample liquidity. I will argue that those phenomenons can all be ascribed to two common causes: a worldwide based shift in the primary distribution of income; and asymmetries in financial development among countries. Together, they combine to produce (1) excess saving in emerging economies (2) strong capital inflows to the US (3) an increasing frequency in financial booms and busts and asset price bubbles in both advanced and emerging economies.  Let’s look first at income distribution. In China, the share of wages in GDP has declined from 55% in 1992 to 48% in 2008. In the US, the median real wage has been stagnant over the last fifteen years despite the fact that real GDP has grown annually by above 3% over the same period. These are deep changes mostly driven by technology and demographics, in proportions which are hotly debated, and partly unexplained. In contrast to wage developments, consumption trends have been widely divergent. In China, the share of consumption has gone down by more than 10 % of GDP over the last decade. In the US, consumption kept growing (both in absolute and in GDP share) fueling the demand for imports. Households in the US could consume more and save less because they felt richer. And they felt richer because the value of their houses and financial assets was rising at a quick pace and that trend was expected to persist. Broadly speaking, the worldwide equilibrium between demand and supply of goods was based on a continuing asset price bubble in the United States. Considering now financial development, another kind of imbalance shows up. The global rise in savings, especially in the emerging world, has not been matched by an equivalent increase in the supply of safe and liquid financial assets. This “asset shortage” is one fundamental reason why bubbles have erupted in many countries with increasing frequency, either in real estate or financial markets or both. It also had a strong impact on the direction of capital flows. Only the US economy has the ability to generate liquid and safe assets in significant quantities. US capital markets act naturally as a magnet for world savings, especially for foreign exchange reserves. In addition, financial engineering allowed US institutions to manufacture complex products which looked apparently safe, but proved very fragile. Admittedly, internal imbalances and huge deficiencies in supervision and regulation BIS Review 170/2010 1 
played a role in the run up to the crisis. But the process has been largely driven by capital inflows in the US looking for an improbable combination of liquidity, safety and high returns.  Combining all these evolutions gives a good picture of the structural forces behind the crisis. Worldwide shifts in income distribution generated excess saving, which were compensated by wealth effects borne out of increases in asset prices. Since those transformations were asymmetrically distributed around the world, they were accompanied by growing imbalances and capital flows. Obviously, purely domestic factors, especially in the US played a major role in amplifying the underlying imbalances. But, ultimately, the crisis was borne out of structural changes in the world economy and our collective inability to adjust.  Looking forward, many features of the precrisis environment will still be with us. Emerging economies will still be saving a high proportion of their income. A significant part of those savings will be invested in foreign exchange reserves. Downward pressures on wages will subsist. There are signs that wage dynamics are changing, especially in China, whose economy is deemed by many analysts to have reached the “Lewis turning point” where demographic pressures are offset by increased demand for (at least) qualified labor. Nevertheless, the process will likely be very gradual. As for advanced economies, biased technical progress and pressures from the emerging world as well as unemployment may work to constrain wage dynamics. A general sense of economic insecurity will lead to increase in savings. In most countries and especially in Europe there is an urgent need for strong fiscal consolidation. Market discipline will act powerfully to impose strong consolidation of public finance over an extended period of time.  Therefore, it is a valid question to ask: where will growth in world demand come from in the future ? This may sound paradoxical. In most of the emerging world, demand seems to be booming, and, for many analysts future economic growth will be primarily constrained by the scarcity of natural resources and environmental pressures. These are real and unprecedented and they call for a new technological revolution. I am optimistic. History has taught us that Malthus and its intellectual descendants have always been proven wrong. The whole process of economic growth was borne out of the ability of mankind to overcome scarcity through human inventiveness and technical progress. It won’t be different this time.  I am also very optimistic in the long run on the fundamental rebalancing of the world economy. Income per capita levels in the emerging world will progressively converge to those of the advanced economies and this will present gigantic market opportunities for producers in those countries. At the same time, tensions and insecurity created by differences in income and productivity levels will abate and disappear.  The transition process, however, may be bumpy. Unavoidably, advanced economies, especially in Europe, will have to adjust to the permanent shift in world comparative advantages. They will have to increase flexibility and, above all, develop and preserve their most precious resource – human capital – through education and excellence in research. Emerging economies will have to face the dual challenge of aging and reducing inequalities.  During that transition period, which may last several decades, it is important that the whole process is not derailed by shocks and crisis borne out of imbalances in the world economy. This is where the twin questions – (1) of the level and distribution of global demand and (2) the level and allocation of world savings – may matter most.  Inside the G20, there is broad agreement on the need to rebalance aggregate demand. That shared objective creates cohesion and has played an essential role in 2008 and 2009 in restoring confidence and setting the path for the recovery. The debate is still going on, however, on three major and interrelated issues : first, the appropriate pace of the rebalancing, with advanced countries feeling a greater sense of urgency; second, on the most efficient strategies, in particular regarding exchange rates; and finally, and more broadly, on the best international financial and monetary architecture.  2 BIS Review 170/2010 
I would like to offer some tentative reflexions. These are purely personal thoughts, although I will try to put them in perspective with the incoming French Presidency of the G20.  Rebalancing global demand will not be an easy task. Simple arithmetic and size effects show the amplitude of the challenge. At the word level, to compensate one for one for a decrease of 1% in US consumption, Chinese consumption has to go up by 7%. In addition, saving behaviours are deeply rooted in cultural and demographic structures of our societies. In western countries, consumption can be seen as the ultimate objective of economic activity, as well as the fundamental measure of welfare. Other countries may have different preferences. In a speech one year ago, Governor Zhou pointed to the fact that “East Asia countries are influenced by Confucianism, which value thrift, self-discipline, … and anti-extravagancy”. In a period of aging, thrift will be seen as a necessity as much as a virtue. Shifts in income distribution might not happen fast if strong structural forces push in the other direction. Public policies (fiscal, social safety nets) certainly have a role to play, but they take time to redeploy and implement. Finally, consumption patterns differ across countries and are strongly influenced by differences in taste and level of developments. So, global rebalancing in consumption requires a change in production structures. That change will not – and should not – occur overnight. Attempts to speed up the process would only result in major disruptions and increased volatility. Rebalancing will be progressive but should start now. It cannot be achieved without some adjustment in relative prices. In market economies, it is important that producers face the right price environment when they make long term decisions about investing in technology and productive capacity. Countries are free – and should remain free – to choose whatever exchange rate regime and policy suit them best, taking into account their specific national circumstances. Real exchange rate adjustment, however, is an integral part of a global and orderly rebalancing strategy. That wisdom is best embodied in one of Governor Hu Xiaolian’s speeches, last July, where she demonstrated how domestic factor price and exchange rate adjustments are both substitutes and complementary.  Many interactions between our economies occur through capital rather than good markets; This is normal in a “multipolar” world given the diversity of countries, with different preferences, demographics and levels of development. Some of us save more than we spend. Others need capital to finance their growth. Many are aging and want to secure their future income through good and safe returns on their investments. We therefore share a common interest in well functioning global capital markets. Asymmetries in financial development prevent us from reaping all the benefits of our savings efforts.  These asymmetries exist for good reasons. In many emerging economies, the memories of the 1997–98 crisis are still there. They lead to precautionary behaviors and a very cautious approach to capital market liberalization. Obviously, the case for unrestricted financial development and market liberalization has been somehow weakened by the crisis.  Nevertheless, we might be paying a heavy price for the disorganized state of our global financial and monetary system. While real interest rates are historically low, many investments with high returns are not undertaken. Poor and emerging economies growth is, in many cases, constrained by lack of infrastructure. We may face future shortages in many essential commodities because of insufficient investment in the current period. Differences in financial systems also exacerbate capital flows and exchange rate volatility, especially when, as is the case today, monetary policies are widely divergent across countries. Surely, we can do better in the future. Full harmonization and total convergence in financial development between different countries is neither desirable nor feasible. But ensuring that our different financial systems interact harmoniously should be a priority. There are four possible avenues for progress.  BIS Review 170/2010 3 
First, greater convergence in financial regulation approaches between advanced and emerging economies. Significant advances are being made. China, together with Brazil and India has been, for a year, a full member of the Financial Stability Board, and as, such, participates in steering and leading the effort to build a more resilient and efficient global financial system. Second, we may start thinking about ways of dealing with international capital flows volatility. For one given country, capital controls may temporarily reduce the pressure on its capital account or even permanently limit the volatility of its exchange rate. For the whole international system, however, they may simply displace the pressure to other countries or asset classes and exacerbate, rather than reduce, overall volatility. There might be ways to eliminate those negative effects by creating a predictable framework defining the circumstances, modalities and conditions trough which temporary or permanent controls would be implemented. Third, it is important that countries which decide to open their capital markets be adequately protected against external financial shocks. Emerging countries have constantly sought to expand their foreign exchange reserves from 4 percent of GDP in 1190 to over 20 percent on average today. Reserves act as precaution against possible abrupt capital outflows. They also serve to provide liquidity to domestic financial institutions. They are used as a tool for internal – as well as external – financial stability.  The need for national reserves could be reduced if credible mechanisms exist to provide for the supply of official liquidity on a multilateral basis. Hence the current search for financial safety nets which has taken first stage in the G20. Significant progress has been achieved in this direction during the recent period with the creation by the IMF of new facilities and a new SDR allocation, the biggest ever, for the equivalent of 250 bn USD. More needs to be done and work should be undertaken to find sources of international liquidity truly substitutable to reserves without creating undue and excessive moral hazard.  And, finally, an important question is to find, in the future ,reliable international stores of value. The crisis has amplified the “asset shortage” as some instruments, up to now considered as riskless, have proved very vulnerable to changing financial conditions. The ability of the private sector to create “safe” assets through financial innovation has proved largely illusory. So, in the period to come there may be both an increased demand worldwide for risk free assets and much less certainty on their future supply.  The search for a reliable international store of value has been going on for many decades. When discussions were held to build the Bretton Wood system, Keynes proposed the creation of a new international currency, the “bancor” which could serve both as a source of liquidity and a store of value. Thirty years ago, there was extensive discussion in the IMF on the creation of a substitution account. Most recently, in 2009, Governor Zhou has reopened the debate and suggested, over the long run, the creation of a new “super reserve” currency, while, in the meantime, enhancing the role and status of the SDR.  There are good arguments to create international instruments providing a reliable store of value. There are also conceptual and political difficulties. A choice would have to be made as to the true nature of the “super reserve currency”. Would it be a basket of existing monies such as the SDR today? Or would it be a new “fiat” currency? More fundamentally, a new reserve currency would, in fact, grant a collective guarantee against exchange risk. This guarantee would benefit surplus countries and would be given by deficit countries. When the substitution account was discussed more than 25 years ago, it became clear, at the time that it would have to be part of a package encompassing explicit, binding and symmetric rules on balance of payment adjustments. Most likely, the same questions would be raised again today and the creation of a new reserve currency would have to be part of a broader framework. That may take time, as our Chinese colleagues are fond of reminding us when we discuss those issues. 4 BIS Review 170/2010 
BIS Review 170/2010 5 In the meantime, financial development in emerging economies can go a long way towards expanding the range of safe and liquid financial assets available to domestic and international investors. Capital markets in local currencies have developed significantly over the last decade as fiscal positions in emerging countries have dramatically improved. There seems to be considerable scope for regional financial and monetary arrangements to prosper in the future. Those huge pools of savings currently available can be intermediated locally instead of going through financial systems located in advanced economies. Regional financial markets would have to complemented and underpinned by monetary arrangements. Asian countries are working on and implementing progressively such schemes through the Chiang Mai initiative. We, in Europe, monitor closely those evolutions as well as the progressive emergence of the RMB as an international currency. As you know, we have a long and successful history of economic, financial and monetary integration. We have learned a lot and, still recently, gone through many crises and difficulties. Nevertheless the Euro, which did not exist fifteen years ago, stands today as one of two major world currencies. We certainly don’t pretend our own experience should constitute a model or an example to be followed. I have, however, one certainty: a strong and permanently renewed spirit of cooperation has allowed us to overcome many obstacles and to reap many benefits in terms of prosperity and stability. In a world full of opportunities, but also increasingly complex, this may be an inspiration for all of us. I thank you for your attention.

Glenn Stevens: Inquiry into competition in the Australian banking sector Opening statement by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry into competition in the Australian banking sector, Sydney, 13 December 2010. *      *      * The Reserve Bank has provided a submission to the Committee that details trends in lending, costs, margins, fees and other factual material the Committee may find of use. We of course will seek to answer any questions on that submission.  Perhaps I should note a few general points.  First, risk has been re-priced since early 2007. All of us are still adjusting to this change and its implications.  It is widely held that risk was under-priced for some years before then. That is to say, investors demanded very little risk compensation in their expected returns – perhaps in some cases because they didn’t understand the risks. So financial institutions of all types could get ample funding cheaply, and this could be passed on to their borrowers. Business models that took particular advantage of low-cost wholesale funding and/or securitisation were able to provide a very competitive edge to certain markets, particularly (though not only) to markets for mortgage lending.  But investors around the world changed their attitude to risk in 2007 and 2008. The compensation they require for taking on risk has increased. Wholesale funding and securitisation are now more expensive. In the case of securitisation, costs have also risen in part because some investors have left the market altogether.  The increase in costs has affected all financial institutions, but to varying degrees. As such, it has also affected the competitive landscape. Some business models that did well in the earlier state of the world find it harder going now. Part of the competitive advantage they had has been eroded by market developments. The current relationship between variable mortgage rates and market funding costs is making it more difficult than it used to be for the lenders relying on securitisation to compete with the major banks.  This changed attitude to risk has affected the locus of competitive forces. Whereas four years ago the environment was one in which the competition among financial institutions to lend money was intense, more recently it has been the competition to raise money that has been intense. Various other things have happened that also have a bearing on the competitive landscape, but this is a very fundamental change in the state of the world.  That said, the market remains a good deal more competitive than it was in the mid 1990s and borrowers have access to a much larger range of products. Moreover, the overall availability of finance to purchase housing in particular seems to be adequate.  The second theme is that, the market price of risk having risen, various players want the public purse to take on some of this higher price through various forms of support or regulatory change.  The various ideas should, of course, be assessed on their merits. But an important high-level point is that, in some instances at least, it would appear the taxpayer is being asked to shoulder more risk, one way or another, in order to facilitate the provision of private finance.  Whether, and in which areas, that might be a good idea – and if so how much might be charged for such support – is of course for governments and legislatures to determine. Hopefully your inquiries will be able to assist this process.  BIS Review 169/2010 1 
Charles Bean: The economic outlook for 2011 and beyond Speech by Mr Charles Bean, Deputy Governor for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, at the Market News International Annual Seminar, London, 13 December 2010. *      *      * Good morning! Christmas is the traditional time for looking back over the events of the past year and contemplating what the new year might bring. Today I shall follow that tradition by taking stock of economic developments over the past year and looking at the challenges ahead.  Many of the recent activity indicators have been somewhat comforting. Global growth has recovered strongly on the back of a strong rebound in the emerging economies, with the IMF projecting expansion of close to 5% this year and more than 4% next year. Here in the United Kingdom, we have also seen a nascent recovery; output in the third quarter was, according to the latest ONS estimates, some 2.8% higher than a year earlier. That is marginally stronger than our projection for the most-likely path of four-quarter growth made a year earlier in our August 2009 Inflation Report.  Around half of the growth over the past year was, however, down to the contribution of stockbuilding, as businesses reduced the rate of inventory decumulation and, in some cases, started to rebuild stocks. That can only provide a temporary boost to aggregate demand growth. And the contribution of public spending to growth is also set to fall as the Government’s planned fiscal consolidation gets underway. So economic prospects depend crucially on private final domestic demand and net exports picking up the baton; fortunately there have been signs that handover might be starting to take place in the latest quarterly data.  Private final domestic demand fell sharply in the recession. Consumer spending decreased by more than 4% over the five quarters from 2008Q2, as the prospect of reduced real incomes led households to cut their borrowing and build up precautionary savings balances. During this period, the household savings rate rose by almost six percentage points. Since then, we have seen a modest recovery in consumer spending, and measures such as the CBI Distributive Trades Survey suggest that recovery is likely to have continued into the final quarter of this year.  The prospects for household spending through next year and beyond depend crucially on households’ expectations of their future incomes, as well as their balance sheet positions. Consumer confidence measures have generally weakened through this year, possibly reflecting concerns about the prospective fiscal consolidation. An open question is how far the impact of that consolidation has already been taken on board by households in their spending decisions, and how much adjustment is yet to come. The annual survey of households’ financial positions carried out for the Bank by NMG Consulting1 included some special questions on this topic and found that, while the majority of households expected to be affected in some way, less than half had so far responded by spending less, working longer hours or looking for a new job. That suggests there may be further adjustment to come.  Investment fell even more sharply than private consumption during the recession – down almost 20% – as the higher cost and reduced availability of finance, coupled with sharply heightened uncertainty about economic prospects, led businesses to cancel or postpone                                                  1  See “The financial position of British households: evidence from the 2010 NMG Consulting survey” by Mette Nielsen, Silvia Pezzini, Kate Reinold and Richard Williams, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, Winter 2010.

investment projects. While the outlook remains highly uncertain, the improvement in both financial markets and in the real economy since mid-2009 is likely to have contributed to the modest recovery seen in businesses’ capital spending over the past year. And though continued tight credit conditions may restrain the investment spending of small and medium-sized enterprises, the bulk of capital expenditure is carried out by large businesses. They appear to be less credit-constrained and also have better access to the capital markets. Moreover, despite the downturn, the corporate financial position appears to be relatively healthy. So the availability of finance is unlikely to be a major brake. Rather investment spending is likely to be restrained by the juxtaposition of muted product demand and an overhang of spare capacity.  For almost as long as I have been a member of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee, we have pointed to the need for a re-balancing of the composition of demand at some juncture, away from domestic demand and towards net exports. Accompanying that re-balancing would be a re-orientation of the structure of activity away from businesses that predominantly meet domestic needs towards those producing internationally tradable goods and services. The substantial depreciation of sterling – down around a quarter since August 2007 – should facilitate that re-balancing by making it more profitable to produce for export or to compete against imports. For example, relative unit labour costs in the United Kingdom are now more than 25% lower than before the crisis.  The contribution of net exports to the recovery had – at least until the very latest GDP release – been somewhat disappointing. Net exports reduced growth by a total of 0.7 percentage points over the past four quarters, as import growth outstripped that of exports. As world output, weighted according to countries’ importance to UK trade, grew somewhat faster over that period than UK activity, the weakness in the UK’s net export performance cannot be attributed to a more rapid recovery here. Some of the weakness can perhaps be ascribed to strong import growth associated with the working out of the stock cycle, as inventories are relatively import intensive. But closer investigation suggests that the weakness has been especially concentrated in exports of financial services, no doubt in part reflecting the impact of the banking crisis. Foreigners’ demand for UK financial services may plausibly continue to be somewhat lower than before the crisis, so this weakness may persist.  In contrast, there are signs that the depreciation in sterling is having the expected effect on the market share of goods exporters. That is also reflected in the robust growth in manufacturing output and in business surveys which report buoyant export orders. So far, there is less sign that the lower level of sterling is leading to the substitution of imports by domestically produced goods and services. But it is likely that the producers of internationally tradable goods and services take time to respond to the improved opportunities associated with a lower real exchange rate, especially if investment in foreign distribution networks or the repatriation of off-shored activities is required. So, other things equal, it seems reasonable to expect the impact of the lower level of sterling on net exports to continue to build through next year.  The prospects for net exports obviously depend not only on the response to the past depreciation of sterling, but also on demand in the UK’s main export markets. While global growth has been strong over the past year, much of that has been in emerging economies that presently account for a relatively small proportion of UK exports.  Growth has been patchier in the developed economies. In the United States, following a series of soft indicators through the late summer and early autumn, the US Federal Reserve announced additional purchases of US treasuries. And the Obama administration is seeking to inject a further fiscal stimulus, incorporating not only the widely expected extension of the Bush administration tax cuts, but also a temporary cut in payroll taxes. The extension of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programme has proved controversial, with some US critics asserting that it is inflationary and policymakers in some of the emerging 2 BIS Review 169/2010 
economies claiming that it is both an attempt to engineer a beggar-my-neighbour devaluation and that it will boost capital inflows and foster asset-price bubbles.  These criticisms seem to me mostly off the mark. Central banks undertake asset purchases financed by the issuance of central bank money in order to boost nominal spending. They do that by depressing a range of longer-term real yields and raising asset prices. The earlier phases of quantitative easing both here and in the United States indeed appear to have lowered longer-term nominal and real yields below where they would otherwise have been.2 This time around, the transmission channel has been rather different, as after falling on the anticipation of further asset purchases, longer-term US yields rose. But the policy should only prove inflationary in the medium to long run if it results in excessive nominal spending growth, which hardly appears likely at the current juncture. Only if the Federal Reserve fails to tighten policy promptly as the recovery takes hold is excessive inflation likely to be a problem. The criticisms from outside seem to me almost as misplaced. While quantitative easing is likely to be associated with exchange rate depreciation, it also boosts domestic spending. Demand in other countries therefore rises as a result of the increased demand in the United States, as well as falling as a result of the appreciation of their currencies. These are just the normal mechanisms that operate when official interest rates are cut in one country. It is then an empirical matter which is the dominant channel. Quantitative easing is consequently very different in character from sterilised exchange rate intervention, which merely redistributes global demand.  There is, though, more substance to the concern that stimulatory monetary policies in the developed economies have encouraged a search for yield and capital inflows into the emerging economies. So there is some justification for the imposition of temporary restraints on those inflows. But where such asset price pressures are building, they seem more likely to be related to overly loose monetary and financial policies in those countries and their unwillingness to allow exchange rates to bear more of the strain.  It is the euro area, however, that is of particular importance to the United Kingdom. In aggregate, the euro area looks to be undergoing a steady recovery, not dissimilar to ours. Output in the third quarter was 1.9% higher than a year earlier, roughly in line with the euro area’s historical average growth rate. But that masks markedly divergent performance and prospects within the euro area. Germany is growing rapidly, led in part by an expansion in exports to the booming Asian economies. The countries of the periphery are, however, struggling in the face of significant fiscal and structural challenges. While the countries of the euro-area periphery are each confronted by specific challenges, they all need to restore their competitiveness without the option of devaluation. Instead, in the absence of effective structural reform, they face the prospect of sustained low growth in order to drive down wages and prices. That itself makes the task of stabilising public debt harder.  Support to Greece and Ireland from the IMF and rest of the European Union has given those countries a breathing space in which to undertake the necessary adjustments. Financial support for other countries may or may not prove necessary – only time will tell. But the important thing for us is whether an intensification of the difficulties in the euro-area periphery could also derail the recovery here.                                                   2  Analysis of the earlier phases of quantitative easing both here and in the United States suggest that purchases of the order of 12–14% of GDP have lowered longer-term government and corporate bond yields by around 70–100 basis points relative to where they would otherwise have been. See Michael Joyce, Ana Lasaosa, Ibrahim Stevens and Matthew Tong, “The Financial Market Impact of Quantitative Easing,” Bank of England Working Paper No.393, 2010, and Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack, “Large-scale Asset Purchases by the Federal Reserve: Did They Work?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Staff Report No.441, 2010. BIS Review 169/2010 3 
Sharp fiscal consolidation and very slow growth in the periphery countries would, of course, have some adverse impact on the demand for our exports. But the more significant links are potentially through the financial system. Fortunately, UK banks have done much to improve their resilience over the past couple of years and, even under a very adverse scenario, they should be able to absorb the likely losses on their direct exposures to Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain without too much difficulty. There is, though, the possibility of further indirect effects arising through the interconnectedness and cross-border operations of European banks which could amplify the impact. So some adverse effect on the funding costs of UK banks and the supply of credit remains a possibility.  Harder to gauge is the potential effect on household and, especially, business confidence. In the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, this was arguably the most significant transmission channel to the real economy. An intensification of the sovereign debt problems in the euro area could therefore administer a blow to the recovery here. But given the very high degree of uncertainty, there is little that the MPC can do to deal with this risk ahead of crystallisation.  While UK output growth has come in much in line with our expectations, the same cannot be said of our primary objective, inflation. Back in August of last year, our central projection was for CPI inflation to be around 1.5% now. But inflation has been markedly stronger than that – 3.2% on the latest reading. Why has inflation been so much higher, especially given that our expectations for growth have largely been fulfilled? There are three factors that account for this.3  First, energy and non-oil commodity prices are substantially higher than in the summer of 2009. By convention, we base our forecasts for these variables on futures prices, which were relatively flat at that time. The buoyancy of commodity prices since then reflects the rebound in global activity, and especially the strength in the emerging economies. In addition, temporary supply factors have boosted the prices of some agricultural commodities. At present there appears to be a margin of spare capacity in the oil market, so that may permit global growth to remain strong without putting further upward pressure on energy prices immediately. But a low elasticity of supply of other commodities means that their prices, relative to those of finished goods and services, may continue to drift upwards. That would constitute an additional headwind for the United Kingdom.  A second factor behind the unexpectedly high inflation appears to have been greater than expected pass-through into final prices from the depreciation of sterling after August 2007. Evidence from the United Kingdom and other countries during the Great Moderation suggested that pass-through had fallen, perhaps because inflation expectations were better anchored. We expected something similar on this occasion too. In the event, the strength of UK goods inflation, relative to that in the other G7 economies, suggests that the pass-through of the depreciation was in fact rather greater, and similar to that before the Great Moderation.  The third potential ingredient behind higher inflation is a more moderate drag from the margin of spare capacity in the economy. Pay growth has been subdued during the recession, and that has helped to ensure that unemployment has risen far less than many commentators feared. Rather the puzzle is on the pricing side, as prices have been higher relative to costs than expected.  That could indicate that the margin of spare capacity is not as large as the collapse in activity might suggest. On current estimates, output is presently about 10% below a continuation of its pre-crisis trend. But historical experience indicates that the output losses – relative to the pre-crisis trend – after banking crises tend to be highly persistent. That suggests that such                                                  3  See pages 48–49 of our August 2010 Inflation Report for more on this. 4 BIS Review 169/2010 
crises are associated with an impairment of supply capacity too. Business surveys are consistent with this, implying that the margin of spare capacity in firms is now relatively limited – in fact not much larger than after the bursting of the dotcom bubble. But against that, it is difficult to find any direct evidence of supply impairment. For instance, liquidations have been running at less than 1% (compared to 3% in the 1990s recession). One resolution of the puzzle may be that producers have mothballed capacity, which could, at a cost, be brought into use if demand conditions warranted.  The MPC’s view is that the current elevated level of inflation is likely to persist in the near term – indeed our central expectation for inflation is somewhat higher than that of outside commentators. Ultimately, however, this period of elevated inflation should prove temporary. The standard rate of VAT is set to rise again at the beginning of next year, but once that drops out of the annual comparison a year later, so the inflation rate is likely to fall back sharply. The impact on prices of sterling’s past depreciation should be starting to wane. And the relatively moderate expansion that we expect over the next year or two should ensure that there is some, albeit uncertain, brake on inflation from spare capacity. We have seen muted underlying inflation pressures in both the euro area and the United States, reflecting the spare capacity in those economies, and there is no reason to believe that the United Kingdom will behave differently once the temporary influences subside.  But there are risks to this scenario. They are twofold. First, that strong global growth continues to generate upward pressure on the prices of commodities and tradable goods more generally. And, second, that the period of elevated inflation causes medium-term inflation expectations to drift up, leading to higher rates of increase of both wages and prices. Measures of near-term household inflations have moved up in line with the MPC’s own assessment of near-term inflation, but the rise in longer-term measures has been considerably more muted. And measures derived from inflation swaps suggest that the expectations of financial market participants five years ahead have remained stable. But given the unexpected strength of inflation in recent months, this risk has probably increased of late. So we shall be watching these indicators, and their impact on wages and prices, like proverbial hawks.  What are the implications of all this for monetary policy? The recovery has so far turned out to be broadly in line with that expected a year ago, but the outlook for growth remains highly uncertain. Though inflation has been running well above target and is likely to continue to do so for a while yet, beyond the end of next year it should fall back to near the Committee’s 2% target. In the light of that outlook, I believe we have made appropriate use of the “constrained discretion” granted to us in the Chancellor’s remit, looking through the temporarily elevated inflation to the medium term in order to avoid unnecessary volatility in output. Tightening policy sharply in order to deal with the currently elevated level of inflation would simply have put a brake on the recovery unnecessarily and would have made inflation more likely than not to fall below the target in the medium term.  If all goes to plan, however, and private final demand continues to pick up the baton as the fiscal consolidation proceeds, then the margin of spare capacity will shrink and it will at some juncture become appropriate to begin withdrawing the current extraordinary degree of monetary stimulus. And, when that point comes, the MPC will aim to do so in a timely, but measured, fashion.  As 2010 draws to a close, the good news, then, is that the recovery, here and more widely, has remained on track, following the sharpest downturn in activity since the Great Depression. Such an outcome was by no means guaranteed twelve months ago; for that we must be grateful. But there remain significant challenges for the year ahead. In many developed countries, the after-effects of the financial crisis still linger, in the form of banks that are still overly reliant on official support, fragile household and business confidence, and bloated public sector deficits and debt. Moreover, the rapid recovery in emerging markets BIS Review 169/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 169/2010 has reawakened global inflationary pressures. And here in the United Kingdom, inflation has been running above the MPC’s 2% target for an uncomfortably long time.  It may be some while yet before normality is restored. Thank you. 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Educational games “€conomia” and “Inflation Island” Remarks by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the launch event for the educational games “€conomia” and “Inflation Island”, Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  I’d like to welcome you all to this launch event here today – in particular the students and teachers who accepted our invitation. I also extend a warm welcome to all the other visitors, notably the ECCO colleagues and media representatives – and to ECB staff members who have worked on this project.  In recent years, central banks have become important communicators and since its founding in 1998 the ECB has engaged on several avenues to broaden its outreach. The ECB was the first major central bank in the world to hold a press conference immediately after the Governing Council meeting to explain its monetary policy decisions. We publish a monthly bulletin for specialised audiences. We have educational videos on our website for the general public, we have games for children and of course we have our general publications. In 2010, our website was visited approximately 25 million times. Every year, around 13,000 people visit the ECB and we talk to them about the economy and our work. But there is always room for further improvement. And this is no time for complacency.  We want to reach out to you – young people who have grown up in a networked, multimedia world. So we decided to develop games like these because their interactivity and playfulness could help enhance the learning experience. Today we are launching “€conomia” and “Inflation Island” on our website, and we will continue our work on such tools in the next few years. We expect the games to make this institution and its activities more accessible. The games are available in 22 European languages. You have just been playing against each other in “€conomia” and I hope you found it interesting and fun. But perhaps it wasn’t so easy to keep inflation low and stable, in line with our definition of price stability: less than 2%, but close to 2%. If that was the case, then the games have already served a purpose, because in real life it is challenging to keep inflation low and stable. Developing, producing and translating both games was quite a challenge as well.  I’d like to thank everyone who has worked on the two games over the past year – the Directorate Communications, which is responsible for the project, ECCO members, experts from DG Economics and DG Market Operations, the language and software specialists.  Let me now officially launch the games [by sending a tweet on Twitter and pushing a button to link of the game on the ECB’s Website].  Now it’s my pleasure to hand over the certificates and prizes. In equal 4th place are the European School of Frankfurt and the ISF International School Frankfurt [hands over the certificates] In third place is Lycée Français Victor Hugo [hands over the certificates and prizes] In second place is Friedrich-Dessauer Gymnasium [hands over the certificates and prizes] And the winner is Liebigschule [hands over the certificates and prizes] Congratulations!

Norman T L Chan: Latest developments of renminbi business in  Hong Kong Briefing by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,  on the latest developments of renminbi (RMB) business in Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, 23 December 2010. *      *      * Good afternoon. Today I would like to provide an update on the latest developments of renminbi (RMB) business in Hong Kong.  With the strong support from the Central Government and the relevant Mainland authorities, the development of RMB business in Hong Kong has been encouraging this year. Significant growth and progress have been seen in various areas, including cross-border trade settlement, deposits, bond issuance and the introduction of financial products in the second half of this year. The total amount of RMB deposits increased markedly from RMB 60 billion at the end of last year to RMB 220 billion in October and RMB 280 billion in November this year. Of these deposits, those from personal customers amounted to RMB 120 billion, with a total of 2.2 million accounts and an average deposit size of RMB 54,000. Deposits from corporate clients amounted to RMB 160 billion at the end of November, with 117,000 accounts and an average deposit size of RMB 1.3 million.  Conversion arrangement for trade settlement in 2011 Following the substantial expansion of the geographical coverage of the cross-border RMB trade settlement scheme in June this year, the amount of cross-border RMB trade settlement has grown rapidly, from a monthly average of about RMB 4 billion in the first half of the year to about RMB 30 billion each month in August and September, and close to RMB 68 billion in October. Under such circumstances, the amount of RMB purchased by the Participating Authorized Institutions (Participating AIs) through the Clearing Bank in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System in Shanghai increased notably in October, and the conversion arrangement concerned was suspended in late October. In response, the HKMA promptly introduced a number of measures, and the RMB market in Hong Kong has been operating orderly and smoothly to date.  As regards the conversion arrangement for 2011, after discussions with the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the HKMA consider appropriate to introduce certain refinements to the arrangement for the conversion of RMB conducted by Participating AIs for their customers in relation to cross-border trade settlement. Before going into the specific refinements, I would like to elaborate the background of the arrangement for the conversion of RMB conducted by Participating AIs through the Clearing Bank in Shanghai: (1) First, RMB funds flowed into Hong Kong through trade payments or other channels will become RMB deposits in Hong Kong, and these RMB funds can be used, deployed or exchanged freely into other currencies in the market in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in Hong Kong. This is the main premise of developing an RMB offshore market in Hong Kong. In other words, the exchange rate and interest rate of RMB are to be determined by the supply and demand of RMB funds in the Hong Kong market. As the offshore and onshore markets are segregated, it is not unusual that the pricing may be different between the two markets.  BIS Review 175/2010 1 
(2) Secondly, we should look at the actual supply and demand of RMB funds in the Hong Kong market this year. At the end of November, the total amount of RMB deposits in Hong Kong reached RMB 280 billion. This means that Hong Kong has accumulated a substantial pool of RMB funds which can meet the market’s daily demand. Regarding cross-border trade settlement, in the first 11 months this year, payments from the Mainland to Hong Kong amounted to RMB 180 billion while payments from Hong Kong to the Mainland amounted to RMB 50 billion, resulting in a net inflow of RMB 130 billion to Hong Kong. These RMB funds remain in Hong Kong and constitute a main source of supply in the local RMB market. Of the RMB 50 billion paid from Hong Kong to Mainland enterprises, only about RMB 10 billion was obtained by conversion in Shanghai through the Clearing Bank. In November alone, the payment from Hong Kong to the Mainland under the trade settlement scheme reached RMB 22 billion. However, as the arrangement for conducting RMB conversions in Shanghai was suspended, enterprises in Hong Kong could only purchase RMB funds from the Hong Kong market. Given the abundant supply of RMB funds in the local market, the pricing of RMB funds in the Hong Kong offshore market and that in Shanghai were quite close to each other, with the differential between the two staying within 300 pips for most of the time in recent weeks. This shows that the offshore pool of RMB funds in Hong Kong is serving the function of supplying RMB funds to meet the demand from local enterprises, such that there is no need to rely heavily on the onshore conversion window in Shanghai for trade settlement. In other words, the conversion window in Shanghai serves a supplementary rather than the main source of RMB funds for trade settlement purpose.  In order to further promote the steady development of the RMB market in Hong Kong, the following refinement measures will take effect from January next year:  (1) Participating AIs can square their positions with the Clearing Bank when there is a shortfall of RMB arising from conversions with customers for cross-border trade settlement transactions. In other words, Participating AIs should first utilise the RMB trade proceeds purchased from their customers to satisfy requests for RMB conversions for trade settlement transactions before purchasing RMB through the Clearing Bank in Shanghai. (2) Participating AIs can only purchase RMB through the Clearing Bank in Shanghai for their customers in relation to trade transactions due for payments to the Mainland within three months. The HKMA and the PBoC estimate that the demand for RMB conversion in Shanghai would be within RMB 4 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The volume of conversion will be assessed and appropriately adjusted after the first quarter taking into consideration the actual circumstances. (3) In order to maintain a steady supply of RMB, the HKMA will, as a standing arrangement, provide RMB funds of RMB 20 billion through its currency swap arrangement with the PBoC, for cross-border RMB trade settlements. (4) Given the restrictions in the convertibility of RMB, Participating AIs are required to limit their RMB net open positions (whether net long or net short) to 10% of their RMB assets or liabilities. Participating AIs’ credit risk exposure to the Clearing Bank In their letter to the HKMA in November, the Hong Kong Association of Banks raised the issue of credit limit against the background of an increasing amount of RMB deposits being placed by Participating AIs with the Clearing Bank as the RMB business in Hong Kong continued to expand and deepen. The HKMA and the PBoC have held discussions about this issue, and it is considered that the issue could in principle be resolved by the Participating 2 BIS Review 175/2010 
BIS Review 175/2010 3 AIs establishing custodian accounts with the Clearing Bank. This means that the RMB funds will be placed with the PBoC Shenzhen Branch through the Clearing Bank as a custodian to overcome the issue of credit limit. We will further discuss with the PBoC, the Clearing Bank and Participating AIs on the details of such an arrangement including the related legal documents and operational procedures. It is hoped that the arrangement can be implemented soon early next year. Conclusion I believe that next year will be a crucial year for the development of offshore RMB business in Hong Kong. We have made very good progress this year. Along this positive trend, and with the number of Mainland enterprises eligible for the cross-border RMB trade settlement scheme increased substantially to 67,000 recently and with the refinements that we are going to introduce, I am confident that the offshore RMB market in Hong Kong will continue to develop progressively in the coming year, both in terms of the depth and breadth of the market and product development. Four Hong Kong banks have been approved to participate in the Mainland’s interbank bond market, and the applications by a number of banks are being processed by the Mainland authorities. This will provide a channel for the circulation and capital preservation for the RMB funds in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, we have just been informed that HKMA’s eligibility for investing in the Mainland’s interbank bond market has been approved by the PBoC. We are working closely with the PBoC on the implementation arrangements. Finally, to further promote the development of the RMB offshore business in Hong Kong, the HKMA is making preparations for overseas roadshows with the financial industry, focusing on locations which have growing trade and investment flows with the Mainland. We believe that with our joint efforts, Hong Kong will be able to play its role as an RMB offshore market to the fullest, thereby promoting and supporting the nation’s increasing cross-border trade and investment activities while enhancing and consolidating the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre. 
Stanley Fischer: Corporate governance in Israel Summary of the address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel,  to the general assembly of the Association of Publicly Traded Companies, Jerusalem, 23 December 2010. *      *      * I would like to talk of three issues relating to corporate governance in different economic entities in Israel. The Bank of Israel will soon undergo a significant change in the way it makes its decisions. Till now, the Governor has had sole responsibility for interest rate decisions. That situation was the result of, among other things, the generally accepted practice around the world when the Bank of Israel was established, and also of the outstanding personality of the first Governor, Mr. David Horowitz. There are still today several central banks in which the Governor formally makes the decision alone. However, I do not know a single Governor who actually does decide entirely by himself. In the Bank of Israel, for example, there is a set mechanism of the monetary discussion in a narrow forum, in which a discussion is held at the highest professional level. Research has shown that on average group decisions are better than decisions taken by one person. The fact that, till now, one person makes operational decisions in the Bank of Israel, and that there is no board of directors as there is in public companies, is certainly not the ideal situation. The new Bank of Israel Law states that the Bank of Israel will have a Monetary Committee that will make the policy decisions and an Administrative Council that will make the operational decisions. As well as managers from the Bank of Israel, the Committee and Council will have representatives of the public. The Government has appointed a search committee under retired Judge Winograd charged with putting forward a list of candidates for these entities. The search committee is required to consult with the Governor about the proposed members of the Committee and Council, but the final decision is that of the government. I hope that members of the two bodies will be appointed soon, and I am sure that the decisions they will take in the new system in the Bank of Israel will be better. The second subject I would like to speak about is corporate governance in the banking system. The crisis greatly deepened our understanding of the need to strengthen corporate governance in banks. The main measures introduced in Israel in this context are based on the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision and on the Financial Stability Board. The most important topic on which our attention is focused is an update of Directive No. 301 in the Proper Conduct of Banking Business, which deals with several aspects of the work of the board of directors:  Clarifying the role of the board of directors and emphasizing the difference between the functions of the board and those of management;  Strengthening the composition of the board, and the independence and professionalism of the outside directors;  Raising the level of director’s qualifications, and clarifying expectations regarding their functions;  Improving the board’s working practices. The Bank Supervision Department has drawn up the principles regarding the existence of a main risk management function in banks, and all banks have appointed a chief risks officer. The principles of a proper compensation policy have also been formulated, and changes in this sphere are becoming evident world wide. BIS Review 175/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 175/2010 My third subject is what is known as the shadow banking system. The practical significance of this term is that it deals with aspects of the financial system that the regulators do not know how to supervise. In the US and the UK, and to a lesser extent in Europe too, a large part of the credit market is now outside the banking system. In Israel the banking system currently covers slightly above 50 percent of total credit, credit from abroad accounts for some 18 percent, so that nonbank credit has increased to more than 30 percent of the total, mainly as a result of the pensions reform and the Bachar Committee reform. No system of regulation can be perfect, but it is essential that we find a way to supervise nonbank credit. It is no coincidence that many of the companies affected by the crisis belonged to one industry, the real estate industry, and that tells us something. The Securities Authority is responsible for transparency, but it does not regulate due diligence in new issues. In the final analysis, it is the institutions that manage the public’s money that must take the investment decisions. These areas have advanced and improved recently, but we must continue to enhance the quality of supervision over the conduct of these entities, and the quality of corporate governance in companies. 
Ardian Fullani: The Albanian economy and the banking sector in 2010 Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the reception of the Albanian Association of Banks, with bankers and representatives of banks operating in Albania, Tirana, 17 December 2010. *      *      * Dear bank executive managers, Dear participants, It is always a pleasure to meet once the year-end approaches to make a summary of events that characterized the Albanian economy and the banking sector over the course of 2010.  The Albanian economy is forecast to grow in 2010 slightly higher than in 2009. Industry and services provided the largest contribution to the positive economic growth, yielding as well a relative improvement in the balance of payments’ current account. Lek’s exchange rate was more stable compared with the preceding year, whilst consumer prices fluctuated within the Bank of Albania’s target of 3%.  Fiscal policy engaged in a process of fiscal consolidation during the present year, which we consider as critical in order to preserve the budget deficit and domestic debt levels and keep the level of interest payments in check.  Developments in the financial system attest to the full recovery of public confidence in the banking system. As at end of the third quarter of 2010, total banking sector assets accounted for 81.7% of GDP, up 12.2% y-o-y versus merely 0.9% in the same period in 2009.  Deposit growth and higher capital account provided the major positive contribution to the expansion of banking sector activity. Deposits have grown by 18% y-o-y, out of which more than 2/3 of this figure represents foreign currency-denominated deposit growth. Banking sector treasury and interbank operations declined versus the same period in 2009. Liabilities to non-residents have dropped by 32% y-o-y.  Concerning the composition of banking sector assets, we note that lending has grown by 8% on a yearly basis. The annual growth rate of lending has been constantly downward in the last couple of years. Banking sector and interbank operations have grown by about 25% on a yearly basis.  Banking sector investments in non-resident assets increased by 53% y-o-y. Net profit was positive and substantially higher than in the same period in 2009. Return on Assets and Equity stood at 0.6% and 6%, respectively. Capitalization and liquidity figures were at adequate levels. Capital adequacy ratio was estimated at 15.7%, while liquid assets accounted for 28.9% of total assets. As part of the regular stress-test analyses conducted by the Bank of Albania, in the context of a more comprehensive risk evaluation, the banking sector results stable.  Let me now elaborate on some issues I find critically important for the future.  The banking sector weathered the hard liquidity situation in year-end 2008 and early 2009 successfully. Following that period, public deposits in banks have grown at stable rates and liquidity has improved markedly. However, lending has contracted pronouncedly, initially as a result of the higher credit risk and later, due to the fall of business and consumer demand for loans.  Therefore, the free funds were invested in non-resident assets against a background of lower return on investment in the global market. The deteriorated loan quality, the obligation to increase the reserve funds and the lower average rate of return were followed by the decline in the banking sector net profit.  BIS Review 174/2010 1 
For some banks, this situation needs careful monitoring by the governing structures and shareholders in order to identify those operations that would improve the expenditure and income structure and maintain its capitalization levels.  With regard to lending, the Bank of Albania has continuously called for greater banking sector commitment in this regard. This has not been a rhetorical-like request considering that we have taken all the necessary actions to meet the banking sector needs with ample liquidity and we have cut the key interest rate several times. These measures, coupled with lower Government borrowing, have provided room for lower interest rates on ALL lending.  Nonetheless, their decrease still seems insufficient to push credit demand higher. Loan quality remains a challenge both for ALL and foreign currency-denominated loans. Against this setting, it is essential that banks do not only create in a prompt and rigorous fashion reserve funds according to the regulatory requirements, but they should also complete and improve the procedures and human and financial capacities that enable following-up insolvent borrowers. Complete acknowledgement of loan quality-related concerns and the full commitment of governing structures and shareholders allow for its more rapid and ultimate handling.  Otherwise, the banking sector’s capacity to intermediate more effectively would be impaired for a longer time. Banks need to be determined to follow collateral execution procedures for insolvent borrowers. On the other hand, court decisions and particularly the actions of bailiff officers should be prompt and effective. I take this opportunity to appeal to the authorities to prioritize these actions.  If legal procedures need to be complemented and improved further in order to enhance efficiency, the banking industry should make the necessary proposals in a prompt fashion and the public authorities should commit to considering them.  Lastly, I want to elaborate on two other issues. The first relates to governance and accountability in banking operations and the second to the improvement of capacities for the identification, evaluation and management of risks.  These two issues have continuously been part of our regular communication as they rest on the cornerstone of a safe and successful banking activity, public confidence on which remains unwavering.  Concerning governance, last year I constantly highlighted the need for professionalism, commitment, responsibility, farsightedness and accountability to be reflected not only by you but they should also be embodied in your staff.  To make this happen, policies and rules for defining strategies for the development, concrete decision-making, control of particular activities and their reporting to the institution and the public need to be continuously completed and improved. Internal control systems are the ones to determine the institution’s capacity to operate safely. They are indispensable to avoid any room that may be used for abusive actions that would impair the institution. I therefore request that you take the necessary measures in terms of financial, human and technological capacities in order to ensure the safety of each banking operation.  In pursuing its supervisory function, the Bank of Albania will have this matter under close focus and I assure you that any decision that may have hampered the safety of the activity will be handled with utmost stringency by the law. In a broader context, banking activity, in addition to operational risks, is faced with other financial-related risks.  We will therefore increase the regulatory requirements for banks to be engaged in an integrated process of risk evaluation and management proportionate to the level of development and sophistication. In a more practical approach, this implies that banks should have specific functional structures that monitor risks in the main activity areas and endeavour to anticipate their possible evolution and impact on banks’ activity. These structures must be 2 BIS Review 174/2010 
BIS Review 174/2010 3 in place in the largest banks and their products should be an integral part of the decision-making process.  Dear participants,  We are leaving behind a challenging year but other numerous challenges will follow for banking activity. They provide us the opportunity to put our vision into practice, in order to ensure a stable banking activity as a precondition for conducting an efficient intermediation activity with remarkable contribution to economic development at home.  Weathering the challenges requires courage and professionalism. In addition, banking institutions should provide an environment where accountable and professional human capacities are in the service of the public and the institution. I am confident that you will prioritize the foregoing matters in 2011.  I wish you success in your work and many wishes for the New Year!  Thank you. 
Norman T L Chan: Master’s degree 2009–2010 graduation ceremony Speech by Mr Norman T L Chan, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,  at The Chinese University of Hong Kong master’s degree 2009–2010 graduation ceremony, Hong Kong, 17 December 2010. *      *      * Professor Wong, Professor Lee, Faculty Members, Graduates, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour to be invited to speak at today’s Graduation Ceremony. I am so happy to see so many fine men and women graduating today. All of you have made well earned accomplishments that make your parents and families feel very proud. On this joyful day, it is clearly a time for celebrations and photograph-taking with families and friends. However, some of you may, when you have a few quiet moments of your own, ask yourselves these questions : What would I become in 10, 20 or 30 years’ time? Have I chosen the right field or career? What does it take to succeed and make a name in the society as so many of my CUHK seniors have done before me? These are very pertinent questions and certainly I did ask myself these questions when I attended my own graduation ceremony in the CUHK some 34 years ago.  In talking about successful people, I am sure all of us have our own idols. But very few people will disagree with me if I refer to Bill Gates as a prime example of success. We all know who Bill Gates is and how he set up the most profitable software company called Microsoft. Bill Gates is now the richest man in the world and is spending most of his time doing charity work worldwide. Bill Gates is clearly an idol for lots of people, old and young, and a symbol of great success. But how come Bill Gates has become so successful? Many say he is a genius, both in computer programming and in doing business. But is it that simple? I have just recently come across a book written by Malcolm Gladwell, who has referred to an interesting thesis called the 10,000 hours rule. To understand this thesis, you have to look closer at Bill Gate’s life. No doubt Bill Gates is very clever and is extremely talented in computer programming. However, what made him so special as distinct from so many other equally clever and talented people in the past three to four decades is that by the time Gates dropped out from Harvard in his sophomore year in mid-1970s to set up his little backyard software company, he already had 8 solid years of non-stop computer programming experience, something that was exceptionally unique at that time for a young man just over 20. For a number of very peculiar reasons, Gates started his programming venture in as early as 1968 when he was just an eighth grade kid in a high school in Seattle. In those days, even university students in the USA would not find it easy to have access to mainframe computers, let alone doing non-stop programming. But Gates had the opportunity and the advantage of having done lots and lots of programming, probably more than 10,000 hours, when he started Microsoft, which subsequently outperformed all other competitors in the field by huge margins. The question that I have is this: Would Bill Gates still be the same Bill Gates that we now know if he did not have the opportunities that were opened to him in these early years of his adolescence that enabled him to jump start on his programming career ahead of so many other equally clever and talented people in the USA? I don’t quite know the answer, but let me turn to another example of great success in the last century in the musical world – the Beatles. Being a person born in the 1950s, it is not surprising that I am very fond of the Beatles. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were clearly very, very talented. Ever since they launched their hugely successful tour of the USA in February 1964, the Beatles had for several decades became the centre of the rock and roll world. But is it true that Beatles became so good and so successful simply because they were music geniuses? BIS Review 174/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 174/2010 Is it that simple? Let’s look closer at the days before they became the idol of the world. Before 1960, the Beatles was still a struggling high school band. However, through some strange connections, Beatles got invited to play at some night clubs in Hamburg in  1960–1962. Within a year and a half’s time, the Beatles played in these Hamburg clubs for 270 nights. These Hamburg clubs were not the kind of music halls in which proper concerts are conducted. They were more like drinking clubs where lots of people came in and went out constantly as live entertainment on stage was performed. The Beatles had to perform 4, 6 or even 8 hours each night. Because of so many live performances of very long hours, the Beatles had greatly improved their stamina and team work. Moreover, they had to try out different varieties of music and songs in order to satisfy the customers. So, by the time the Beatles made their celebrated US tour in February 1964, they had already done an amazing 1,200 live performances. This is an astonishing and unusual number. In those days and even now, very few rock and roll bands are able to do that many live performances in their entire careers.  Again the question that I have is: Would the Beatles be just as good and as talented without Hamburg?  There was an enlightening study conducted by Ericsson in the 1990s. The study showed that out of the violin students in the elite Berlin Academy of Music, those who were ranked as top of the class and attained performer soloist standard were students that had practised most: over 10,000 hours by the age of twenty. Students ranked at the next level, i.e. professional but not quite soloist standard, had practised less, with 8,000 hours by the age of twenty. For students at the next level down, they had practised for just around 4,000 hours. The results of this study seem to suggest that, once a student had reached a certain level of aptitude and talent, at least good enough for admission into an academy of music, those who practised most diligently tended to yield the best outcome. The study did not find students that had practised more than 10,000 hours had failed to reach the top level. On the other hand, the study did not find students who achieved the top level without putting in a huge amount of practice.  The reason why I wish to share these fascinating stories with you today is not out of pure academic interest or curiosity. To me, these stories carry a message with profound importance. The message is that success or more precisely, great success, does not come naturally. It is often too easy to say Bill Gates or the Beatles became idols of the world because they were born geniuses. Since very few of us are geniuses, it is only natural to conclude that we cannot and should not ever aspire to succeed the way they did. However, if you really dig deeper into the stories of great success, you will probably find that even very clever and talented people have to make use of every opportunity they have come across to develop and perfect their talents before they can transform from good to great, and from great to awesome. While one cannot turn himself into a genius if he is not one, he can still decide, on his own, how hard he works to upgrade and excel in whatever profession that he is pursuing. There is of course no guarantee that if we work really hard we will definitely achieve great success, but at least we will have a chance. If we don’t even give it a try, there is no hope. It does not matter which way you may wish to go as long as you are fully aware that you do have a choice. That choice, which will shape your careers and your whole life, is yours and yours alone.  Thank you. 
Louis Kasekende: Citation for outstanding leadership Citation by Dr Louis Kasekende, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Uganda, at the farewell party for the 2010 retired staff, Kampala, 17 December 2010. *      *      * Prof. Emmanuel Tumusiime-Mutebile has led the Bank of Uganda for almost 10 years. It has been a decade of remarkable achievements; achievements which were made possible both by the Governor’s strategic leadership of the Bank and by his ability to inspire and motivate its staff. His stewardship of the Bank has been notable, not just because it has embodied the highest standards of professional expertise, but also because he has never shied away from taking difficult decisions or of speaking the truth about economic realities, however unpopular this may have been in some quarters.  The Bank of Uganda’s core mandates are to deliver macroeconomic stability and to regulate the banking system. In terms of both objectives, the Bank has been very successful. The Bank’s monetary policy has faced many challenges during the course of the last 10 years: from the difficulties of sterilising large aid inflows in the first half of the decade; from the supply side shocks to international fuel prices and food prices which pushed up inflation temporarily in 2008 and 2009; and then from the consequences of the global financial crisis for the balance of payments and aggregate demand. Under Prof. Tumusiime-Mutebile’s leadership, the Bank’s monetary policy was able to steer the economy through the turbulence created by the external shocks and keep it on an even keel. In particular, the Bank has delivered low inflation; the primary policy objective of its monetary policy. Headline inflation over the course of the last decade has averaged only 6.5 percent per annum. In turn, price stability has enabled the economy to attract increasing amounts of private investment and grow rapidly at an average of 7.4 percent per annum in real terms over the course of the decade. Sound macroeconomic management ensured that our economy was able to withstand the external shocks from the global economic crisis and avoid recession.  Prof. Tumusiime-Mutebile’s leadership of the Bank of Uganda in its role as banking regulator has been equally successful. He assumed the stewardship of the Bank at a time when parts of the banking system in Uganda were experiencing distress. Several banks had failed towards the end of the 1990s, and the largest bank, Uganda Commercial Bank, was under the statutory management of the Bank of Uganda as a result of its insolvency. The Governor’s decision to resolve Uganda Commercial Bank by selling it to a reputable international bank, in the teeth of widespread scepticism and in some cases outright opposition, proved to be one of the most prescient ever taken in the history of banking in this country. UCB was sold to Stanbic Bank, a sale which preserved the nationwide branch network of UCB, and protected its deposits. Since acquiring UCB, Stanbic has been in the forefront of the dynamic expansion of the Ugandan banking system which has occurred in the 2000s, which has included very rapid growth of bank lending to the private sector.  The Governor also spearheaded major legislative reforms to financial regulation which were essential to strengthen the legal framework governing the financial sector in Uganda. The 2003 Micro-finance Deposit Taking Act brought, for the first time in Uganda, deposit taking microfinance institutions under the regulatory aegis of the Bank of Uganda. In the following year, the Financial Institutions Act was enacted, which upgraded banking legislation in Uganda and incorporated important elements of international best practise, such as prompt corrective action provisions for resolving distressed banks. The success of financial regulation in Uganda over the last decade is indisputable. Despite the shocks emanating from the global financial crisis, Uganda’s banking system has remained in a markedly robust financial condition, with average capital adequacy levels comfortably in excess of statutory minimum levels, low levels of non performing loans and impressive profitability.  BIS Review 174/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 174/2010 Prof. Tumusiime-Mutebile was recently appointed to a third five year term as Governor. The Bank will face new challenges in the years ahead. The emergence of Uganda as a “frontier market” will make effective financial regulation, including macro-prudential regulation, even more critical to the stability of our economy. We must upgrade our monetary policy framework to embrace inflation targeting. And we must prepare the Bank for the transition to East African monetary union. We should not be afraid of these challenges, for we are led by a Governor of unique vision, courage and wisdom.  Mr. Governor, please accept this plaque from the Board and staff of Bank of Uganda in recognition of your exemplary stewardship of this institution. You can count on our support. We wish success in your new term.  
Philipp Hildebrand: Global and Swiss economic outlook Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 16 December 2010. *      *      * The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is maintaining its expansionary monetary policy. It is leaving the target range for the three-month Libor unchanged at 0.00–0.75%, and intends to keep the Libor within the lower part of the target range at around 0.25%. The global economic recovery is continuing. While the growth dynamic in emerging economies is vigorous, the recovery in the industrialised economies remains modest overall. Growth in Switzerland was robust in the third quarter of 2010, but the weakening of exports, in particular, points to a significant reduction in growth in the quarters ahead. The SNB expects GDP to grow by some 1.5% in 2011, following growth of about 2.5% in the current year. Monetary policy operates in an environment of heightened uncertainty. Concerns about stability in the euro area have led to renewed financial market tensions. Against this backdrop, the Swiss franc has again appreciated. Should these tensions be exacerbated and put a strain on economic developments in the euro area, this would also have a detrimental effect on the Swiss economy. If a deflation threat emerges, the SNB would take the measures necessary to ensure price stability. The SNB’s conditional inflation forecast for 2012 and 2013 is slightly below the September forecast. This correction is the result, in particular, of the less favourable economic outlook for Europe compared with the last assessment. For 2011 it is marginally higher, due mainly to a higher price for oil. Assuming an unchanged three-month Libor of 0.25%, average inflation for 2010 is expected to amount to 0.7%, for 2011 to 0.4% and for 2012 to 1.0%. The conditional inflation forecast shows that there is no threat to price stability in the short term. However, the rising path in 2012 and 2013 shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be maintained over the entire forecast horizon without compromising long-term price stability. The inflation forecast is still associated with a very high level of uncertainty. Global economic outlook I would now like to take a closer look at the economic situation and at monetary conditions. Overall, the recovery in the global economy continued, encouraged by expansionary economic policies and vigorous economic activity in the emerging economies. In the euro area, however, growth slowed markedly in the third quarter. The favourable developments in Germany’s economy differ from those in the peripheral countries of the euro area, with their weak growth. The recent financial market turmoil is likely to hamper activity in the euro area. Although domestic demand is gradually firming up in the US, the momentum is insufficient for a sustainable reduction in unemployment, which remains high. In addition, construction investment is suffering from the situation on the real estate market. Consequently, GDP growth in the US will remain modest. The vigorous economic momentum in the emerging economies is likely to provide positive stimulus for global growth in the future. BIS Review 173/2010 1 
The SNB has made slight downward revisions to its growth forecasts for the global economy, mainly for Europe in 2011 and 2012. Uncertainty with regard to global economic developments remains very considerable and the risks are still to the downside. Swiss economic outlook Growth of the Swiss economy remained robust in the third quarter. Consequently, utilisation of production factors increased. Technical capacity utilisation has returned to a normal level in manufacturing, while in the construction industry it is in fact considerably higher than the long-term average. Employment also increased moderately and unemployment declined further. However, the indications of a significant slowdown in growth increased. Goods exports stagnated from June to October, mainly due to weaker demand from Europe. Exports of services declined most recently. Inflation, as measured by the national consumer price index, fell to 0.2% in November. The decrease over recent months is mainly attributable to the fall in the prices of imported consumer goods. Accordingly, the core inflation indices calculated by the SNB were somewhat higher, and have remained steady since the last monetary policy assessment. For the coming months, the SNB expects economic growth to continue. However, it is likely to be significantly lower in the quarters ahead – a development attributable to both the generally subdued economic activity in the industrialised countries and the appreciation of the Swiss franc. Consequently, the SNB expects GDP to grow by some 1.5% in 2011, following growth of about 2.5% in the current year. Monetary and financial conditions Monetary and financial conditions in Switzerland are shaped by the expansionary monetary policy. Since mid-September, the three-month Libor has remained fairly constant within the lower part of the target range. Yields on high-quality Swiss bonds remain at a low level, despite the latest increase. This also applies to long-term real interest rates, which are ultimately decisive in investment and consumption decisions. Historically low interest rates for corporate loans and mortgages also create conditions which stimulate domestic final demand. Concerns about stability in the euro area have led to renewed financial market tensions. Against this background, the Swiss franc has again appreciated. As shown in the survey carried out by the delegates of the SNB regional contact network and published next week in the Quarterly Bulletin, business activities of numerous companies are hampered by this development. An aggravation of the crisis in the euro area would inevitably have further negative consequences for the Swiss economy. As my colleague, Jean-Pierre Danthine, will outline in more detail later, liquidity-absorbing operations have continued since the monetary policy assessment of September 2010. As a result, bank sight deposits with the SNB have fallen further. Nevertheless, the monetary base is still significantly higher than its level prior to the financial crisis. The broader monetary aggregates have continued to expand strongly since the last assessment, and pose a potential threat to long-term price stability. In view of the expansionary monetary conditions, lending business remained brisk. According to the SNB survey on bank lending, banks maintained their lending standards for companies and households in the third quarter of 2010. Several banks reported that household demand for mortgages increased again. This is reflected in the continued high growth rate of mortgage volume. Moreover, real estate prices continue to rise. The situation on the mortgage and real estate markets still requires the full attention of the SNB. 2 BIS Review 173/2010 
Impact of foreign exchange market interventions on the SNB balance sheet Since the beginning of the financial crisis, the SNB balance sheet has lengthened considerably and its composition has changed, in particular due to the SNB’s foreign exchange market interventions. Since the beginning of 2010, the balance sheet total has increased from CHF 207 billion to some CHF 280 billion. Moreover, the significant appreciation in the Swiss franc has resulted in considerable exchange rate losses on the SNB’s foreign currency investments. My colleague, Thomas Jordan, will take a closer look at the risks for the SNB associated with the lengthening of the balance sheet. After the beginning of the financial crisis, the SNB lowered money market interest rates to virtually zero. Despite these decisive reductions in interest rates, the Swiss economy faced the threat of deflation from March 2009 onwards. This required the SNB, as part of its mandate, to undertake a further monetary policy easing. In view of the limited size of the domestic capital market compared to other countries, foreign currency purchases seemed the most appropriate course of action for Switzerland. This allowed for the absorption of extreme exchange rate developments, which could have triggered a deflationary dynamic. In absorbing the upward pressure on the Swiss franc, the SNB may have taken on a higher balance sheet risk, however, in doing so, it countered the risk of a deflationary trend. Although the Swiss franc has appreciated sharply since the beginning of the year, the deflation threat has declined as the economic recovery has strengthened. The appreciation of the Swiss franc has impaired the competitive position of Swiss exporters. However, the negative impact on export demand has been reduced by robust economic growth in the economies importing Switzerland’s goods and services. Chart of conditional inflation forecast I would now like to comment on the new, conditional inflation forecast in more detail. The (dashed) red curve on the chart represents the new, conditional inflation forecast. It shows the future path of inflation, assuming that the three-month Libor remains constant at 0.25% over the entire forecast horizon, and it covers the period from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the third quarter of 2013. For purposes of comparison, the (dash-dotted) green curve shows the inflation forecast published in September, which was also based on the assumption of a three-month Libor of 0.25%. The new conditional forecast shows that inflation remains low for 2011 and 2012. The forecast for the next few quarters is revised because new data has been taken into account. The new forecast for 2011 is slightly above that published in September because the oil price has increased. The increase in inflation in the third quarter of 2011 is attributable to a base effect, because inflation in the third quarter of 2010 was comparatively low. Compared to the forecast published in September, inflation in 2012 and 2013 rises less steeply, particularly due to the fact that the economic outlook for Europe is less favourable than in the previous quarter. Towards the end of the forecast horizon, inflation rises briskly and exceeds the upper bound of 2%, assuming that the three-month Libor remains at the current level. This shows that the current expansionary monetary policy cannot be pursued for the entire forecast horizon without compromising long-term price stability. Due to the risks mentioned previously, this forecast is associated with a very high level of uncertainty.  BIS Review 173/2010 3

Jean-Pierre Danthine: Swiss monetary policy and Target2-Securities Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Danthine, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 16 December 2010. *      *      * My remarks today will focus on three topics. I will start by looking at the situation on the international financial markets. I will then speak about the SNB’s own financial market activities in connection with the two core tasks of monetary policy implementation and foreign exchange reserves management. Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the planned pan-European securities settlement system, Target2-Securities. International financial markets The situation on the international financial markets reflects the gradual global economic recovery. At the same time, these markets continue to be affected by the fallout from the financial crisis and by doubts as to whether the current global economic recovery will be robust enough to reduce the existing financial imbalances. On the stock markets, volatility has trended downwards over the past half-year, but has remained high. Shares and corporate bonds have benefited from investors’ growing risk appetite, the ongoing expansionary monetary conditions and good corporate results. On the bond markets, by contrast, uncertainty has, if anything, grown. With the global economic recovery, yields on long-term government bonds have picked up from their low levels. In Europe risk premia for heavily indebted sovereigns have risen markedly. The imbalance in many government budgets has taken problematic proportions. Wide-ranging cuts have been announced in the affected countries, and international rescue packages have been put together, first for Greece and latterly also for Ireland, in order to prevent the situation from escalating. The markets will, however, be monitoring the effectiveness of the announced cuts and support measures very closely. The problem of sovereign indebtedness in Europe remains a source of considerable uncertainty. A high level of uncertainty also remains on the foreign exchange markets. The continuing high volatility is coupled with strongly divergent exchange rate developments. Over the last few years, a number of currencies have appreciated substantially against the two major world currencies: the euro and the US dollar (cf. chart 1). These currency shifts do not just negatively affect the export capability of the countries whose currencies have appreciated; they also have a heavy impact in monetary terms. This is because, in order to keep appreciation in check, some countries have intervened in the foreign exchange markets, with some others even resorting to restrictions on the movement of capital flows. The result has been a global rise in foreign exchange reserves. Indeed, they have almost doubled in the past four years (cf. chart 2). The high level of foreign exchange reserves ultimately reflects substantial global economic imbalances. As we know, the Swiss franc also appreciated substantially in the wake of the financial crisis. Looking at how the Swiss franc’s real and trade-weighted external value has changed over the long term (cf. chart 3), we can see that, historically, periods of Swiss franc strength have alternated with periods of weakness. The fact that the current Swiss franc strength is proving particularly burdensome for the Swiss economy is due partly to the rapidity of the appreciation, but also to the uncertain economic climate. BIS Review 173/2010 1 
Diversification of foreign exchange reserves As you will be aware, our foreign exchange interventions since March 2009 have resulted in the SNB’s foreign exchange reserves expanding to over CHF 200 billion. As we were primarily buying euros, euro holdings accounted for 70% of foreign exchange reserves at one point. In the meantime, we have reduced the euro’s share in the foreign exchange reserves substantially, to 55%. Moreover, we have diversified foreign currency risk further by investing for the first time in Australian and Singapore dollars, as well as Swedish kronor and Danish kroner. Together, these currencies make up 3% of the foreign exchange reserves. The majority of non-euro holdings continues to be in US dollars (25%), Japanese yen (10%), Canadian dollars and pounds sterling. Finally, we have increased the proportion of the foreign exchange reserves that is made up of equities, from 4% back to 10%. This comprehensive repositioning was carried out gradually, and the market had no problem in absorbing it. We were thus able to considerably reduce the risk concentrations in the foreign exchange holdings. An examination of further diversification measures forms part of our annual investment strategy formulation process. Normalisation of the Swiss franc money market The effect of the monetary policy crisis measures introduced in recent years was also felt in the area of monetary policy implementation. By buying foreign currency against Swiss francs, we created a structural liquidity surplus on the Swiss franc market. We have since largely reabsorbed this excess liquidity via a set of instruments that are already well established. Liquidity is absorbed, on the one hand, through weekly issuance of the SNB’s own money market bills (SNB Bills) with terms of 4, 12, 24 or 48 weeks, and on the other through daily one-week repo transactions (cf. chart 4). We are currently using both instruments to absorb around CHF 140 billion of liquidity, of which some CHF 110 billion is accounted for by SNB Bills. This brings banks’ sight deposits, which ultimately determine the level of interest rates on the money market, to around CHF 20 billion. Compared to the period prior to the financial crisis, this level of liquidity is still high. However, our experience with liquidity-absorbing operations shows us that we can reabsorb the excess liquidity at any time. This allows us to manage the three-month Libor. There is a liquidity overhang in the banking system as a result of the interventions. This does not pose a problem for monetary policy, as we reduce the monetary base directly through the liquidity-absorbing operations. Since the absorbed liquidity is tied up in the form of securities, the banks cannot use it either as a means of payment (like cash or sight deposits) or to satisfy their minimum reserve requirements. To the extent that SNB Bills are purchased by non-banks, customer deposits in the banking system decrease, thereby directly reducing the broader monetary aggregates. The decisive factor in determining the degree of monetary policy restrictiveness remains the level of interest rates on the money market. And we are able to control this level by tailoring the scope and conditions of our liquidity-absorbing operations accordingly. The shift in the liquidity regime has brought about a certain number of changes in SNB central bank operations with banks. For instance, we now normally only conduct operations with banks that need to place excess liquidity. The group of these banks is fairly large, consisting of 80 mainly domestic banks. Something that we no longer offer, by contrast, is regular refinancing. Banks now have to cover their refinancing needs via the money market. Refinancing through the SNB is available only in exceptional circumstances via the liquidity-shortage financing facility, at a higher rate of interest. Access to this facility should thus be part of domestic banks’ own liquidity arrangements. A further effect of the regime shift on the money market is that the SNB pays the banks interest for liquidity-absorbing operations, whereas previously it received interest payments for providing liquidity. The SNB’s additional interest costs – which amount to some CHF 100 million for the current year – are offset by the additional income from the correspondingly higher foreign exchange reserves. 2 BIS Review 173/2010 
Experience shows that, in the longer term, the income on diversified foreign exchange holdings will exceed the interest costs on the Swiss franc money market, even after any exchange rate losses are taken into account. However, as we can clearly see from this year’s income statement, the fluctuations in income can be very large. Swiss market considers participation in Target2-Securities, the European securities settlement system Finally, I would like to briefly discuss the planned pan-European securities settlement system. Target2-Securities (T2S) is designed to replace, either totally or partially, the existing domestic settlement systems of the national central securities depositories (CSDs), and to drastically reduce the cost of cross-border securities settlement in Europe. The European Central Bank (ECB) regards T2S as a contribution to the harmonisation and integration of the European market. T2S is scheduled to go into operation in 2014. The ECB’s project will also have an impact on the Swiss financial centre. The question of how the Swiss financial market infrastructure will be connected is important for both the banks and the SNB. In 2009, with the agreement of the SNB, SIX SIS AG – the Swiss CSD and a subsidiary of SIX Group – signed a memorandum of intent to participate in T2S with euro-denominated securities. This would allow banks in Switzerland to settle securities transactions in euros more cheaply. T2S has a multicurrency dimension, and the ECB is very interested in integrating other currencies into the system. Consequently, the SNB, in agreement with SIX Group and the banks, is currently investigating the suitability of T2S for settling Swiss franc-denominated securities. For this to happen, the SNB would have to permit SNB accounts in Swiss francs to be maintained in T2S (similar to Swiss Interbank Clearing SIC), and allow the banks to hold part of their central bank deposits (sight deposits) on their Swiss franc accounts in T2S. The management of SNB accounts within a foreign system would be a significant change that needs to be investigated thoroughly. These investigations are currently underway, and a decision by the SNB on whether to settle Swiss franc transactions in T2S is expected by mid-May 2011.    BIS Review 173/2010 3

Javier Aríztegui: Savings bank restructuring and institutional protection schemes Speech by Mr Javier Aríztegui, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the conference organised by Caja Granada, Granada, 17 December 2010. *      *      * It is a pleasure for me to be able to share with savings banks professionals and Spanish financial system specialists some reflections on what are known as “Institutional Protection Schemes” (IPSs). And it is all the more satisfying to do so in a city as magnificent as that hosting the event today. My thanks, then, to Caja Granada for kindly inviting me to participate in the closing of this conference.  The year 2010 now drawing to a close has been a difficult one for the Spanish banking system, whose activity has continued to unfold in a sluggish economic setting marked by financial markets that have not yet managed to attain the degree of stability and confidence needed. It has thus been a year replete with management challenges, intellectual debates and legislative initiatives. But if we must choose one specific milestone marking it above all others, 2010 has been the year of merger agreements between savings banks, in possibly the most extensive banking concentration process ever undertaken in our country. A sizeable portion of these agreements has taken the form of Institutional Protection Schemes or – to make a further addition to the plethora of acronyms and initials characterising today’s financial jargon – IPSs. While as a general rule I am against this invasion of jargon, perhaps in this specific case the initials are preferable to the longer version, because IPSs, the focus of this conference, are not merely “institutional protection schemes”, or legal instruments suitable for securing the benefits of consolidation under capital regulations. They are and should be much more than that.  IPSs have arisen as an innovative structure in the banking system and, like all new products, they are best evaluated by organising their assessment in steps, or successive degrees of scrutiny, so that at the end of the process their structure can be fully appreciated.  The first step in the process of evaluation will be to judge whether they are timely. The second will focus on their design and construction. The third will be a “use test”. And the fourth and final level of assessment will look at how readily they lend themselves to progressive development so as to cover potential future needs. Allow me to cover these successive steps or facets one by one. Let us start with the first, their timeliness. IPSs are a response to an unquestionable substantive need: the downsizing of the Spanish banking sector, following the excesses of the growth period prior to 2007. These factors left many institutions facing the challenge of a future far removed from the comforts that had characterised the previous period, namely: strong economic growth, abundant liquidity on international markets, extensive business margins and healthy assets. Such comforts were viewed by many as a shield against underlying risks, and in some cases they prompted banks to lower their guard against the problems that were gathering. Given the new playing field in place as from 2007, the responsibility of savings banks is clear: to act resolutely to change those structures that can be improved, in full awareness that other parts of the new situation are exogenous and therefore elude their management capabilities. Hence the importance of taking decisions aimed at improving efficiency, through merger – or concentration – processes that position savings banks at a new set of size and rationality-based coordinates.  BIS Review 173/2010 1 
Faced with this need, the structuring of the new IPS instrument (new, at least, in terms of its current contours) responds to the need to pave the way so that concentration agreements may be reached between a type of institution –savings banks – which, given its business form and complex governance arrangements, does not have the same flexibility as banks to conclude merger agreements. To smooth these concentration processes, the Fund for the Orderly Restructuring of the Banking Sector was also created, a Fund to which the initiators of the various projects can resort to strengthen their capital. This assistance adds further discipline in respect of compliance with the plans, since the condition imposed by the use of public funds is that the capacity of the banking system should be reduced and its efficiency increased.  Mergers and IPSs are thus two alternatives available to savings banks to concentrate their business and restructure. The two options differ in terms of their legal form, but they coincide fully in their objectives and should be equivalent in terms of their results.  Let us turn to the second step of the evaluation process. The guiding principle of the design and legal construction of IPSs has been the search for a concentration mechanism analogous to mergers in terms of practical results. In this connection, the IPS has been structured on three basic pillars. The first entails the relinquishing by all participants to the central body of the IPS of the capacity to determine and implement business strategies and internal risk control and management tools, in such a way that this central body becomes the nerve centre of the IPS. The second pillar comprises the mutual liquidity and solvency pacts between the participating savings banks and the pooling of results, to extents that should exceed 40%. And the third pillar is a commitment to stability of the agreements, which must run for a minimum term of 10 years, and which cannot be broken without the Banco de España first analysing the viability of the various institutions resulting from the fragmentation process. It should be stressed that, in all cases, the agreements so far reached go further than these minimum legal requirements, in the extent of pooling of solvency, liquidity and results. This is because, if so approved by the general meetings convened for next week, the extent of pooling will reach 100%. This solidarity arrangement contributes to providing firm foundations for a common project and giving it substance, since objectives are unified, more efficient management arrangements are set in place and the markets and all intervening agents can more readily perceive the project’s cohesiveness and viability. From the standpoint of banking regulation, by using this design IPSs become consolidatable groups of credit institutions dominated by a central body. Actually, however, they are more than a group; they are de facto mergers (“cold mergers” as they have been called) since, for economic – not legal – purposes, each participant has forgone the individuality proper to a separate legal person. Full mutual liability between the parties to the agreement has been achieved, going beyond what the law governing corporate groups provides for in Spain. Hence, in practice, the participating savings banks become, from a merely economic and managerial standpoint, what are veritable retail banking “regional heads” of the IPS regarding their operational capacity and the way in which they contribute solvency, liquidity and results to the group; yet, from the legal standpoint, they retain their personality and their sovereignty in the agreed distribution of welfare fund assets.  I also pointed out how, like any new product, IPSs must pass muster in respect of the third and most important step of the evaluation process, namely the “use test”, i.e. proof of their adaptation to reality. IPSs have to obtain the same improvements in organisation, efficiency, economies of scope, diversification and quality and unity of management as traditional mergers. They must do so in the same length of time as a normal merger, and they must strive to ensure that their results are clearly perceived by the markets as lasting. 2 BIS Review 173/2010 
In this connection, it is vital that the initiators should be particularly diligent in countering the danger that the “raw novelty” of this legal formula – whose features have had to be rapidly devised – may be used as an excuse for rigidities, procrastination or half-measures.  Compared with traditional mergers, where the combining of objectives and efforts to advance in a single direction is more natural, all the participants in IPSs must be on their guard to prevent the essential goal of unity from becoming distorted. They must strive to ensure that the mind-set of directors, managers and staff alike is geared towards a single goal; individual visions are no longer appropriate here, and nor are decisions not aimed at achieving a better future for the single corporate project that has replaced its predecessors. All the participants in institutional protection schemes are assuming a very specific responsibility here, an institutional responsibility and a personal responsibility. The single economic entity resulting from the IPS – the aggregate – must be profitable and efficient, well-managed and display dynamism befitting the financial sector so as to provide the services demanded by the real economy with quality and at competitive prices. Evidently, in a setting of clear risk-aversion, the road to attain these goals and to convince savingsbank creditors of them, so that they renew the funding they have provided, is not an easy one. This task requires three basic conditions. First condition: resolve in adopting the measures needed using exclusively corporate criteria, in full knowledge that some of them may not be agreeable owing to the personal sacrifice entailed. To achieve this, it is essential that all the interest groups behind the governance of the merged savings banks should identify with the goals of the single project. Second condition: flexibility and speed in adopting these measures. As the saying goes, time is precious. The need to access wholesale funding markets as from the first fortnight in January in 2011 and the greater capital requirements imposed by the regulations in the pipeline and by the widespread increase in the perception of risk should be a spur to all, and they impose a clear-cut reduction in all the timeframes envisaged for the conclusion of the projects. In practice, the timetables for the concentration plans suggested some six months back must be significantly shortened. Implementation of the various steps must be brought forward, with every extra effort and sacrifice needed being made. Third condition: determination in transmitting to the market the idea of a single and consolidated project, of a concentration arrangement equivalent to a merger, of an entity prepared to harness in practice all the synergies and all the management improvements made possible by an IPS structure. To do this a proactive strategy should be adopted, geared to securing the economies of scale characteristic of a merger and to reducing overheads, including unit wage costs, which is imperative in the current economic circumstances. Any sign of wavering should be avoided, since this would be seen as an excuse to question the group’s cohesiveness, which is an unacceptable risk at present. I stated in the introduction that any new product has to be prepared to overcome a fourth and final trial and evaluation step: it must prove its capacity for future development. This is a particularly pertinent demand for the financial system, since what is involved is a nimble and dynamic sector.  IPSs are a structure that must prove to be of use in providing lasting banking services. But it is also true that legislation, specifically Royal Decree-Law 11/2010 of 9 July 2010, has opened up new means for savings banks to pursue their activity, offering a range of possibilities. In particular, it is provided for that savings banks participating in an IPS can convert in the future, de facto or de jure, into savings banks with “indirect activity”, or into foundations, which focus on attending to and developing their welfare fund assets. In this connection they will transfer in full the assets assigned to their banking activity to the central credit institution, in exchange for shares, and they will collaborate efficiently in the management and control of the activity pursued by this bank.  BIS Review 173/2010 3 
Making use of this possibility is a decision incumbent upon the managers of IPSs, and one which should be considered without delay, if funding markets so demand. Or if this should be so required by the even more demanding capital market, to which access will prove vital. In adopting investment decisions, this will call for a high level of certainty in projects and in business structures.  To access bond markets and cover maturities, it may suffice, along with the full sharing of profits and losses and the cross solvency guarantee, to transfer to the central entity a portion of the group’s assets and liabilities (normally that associated with wholesale businesses and branches located in territories in which it does not operate exclusively). We shall find out if this is sufficient from January 2011, when significant volumes of external financing will have to be renewed.  However, probably, when it is necessary to raise capital, by issuing shares of the bank located at the heart of the IPS, a larger contribution of strategic assets and liabilities to this bank will be needed, if it is desired to give expectant new members complete certainty regarding the specific assets and liabilities they are going to share and promote as a shareholder. And I insist that, in the current circumstances, this decision must be taken promptly, if the necessary capital is to be raised for the projects that need to be developed. Firms in other sectors of the economy, savings bank workers, the public in general and welfare projects will ultimately be the true beneficiaries of concentration processes conducted in accordance with the criteria of rationality I have referred to. The Banco de España, in its capacity as the supervisory authority, has adapted the organisational structure of its supervisory services to the new savings bank map, in order to monitor meticulously the progress of each project. Before concluding, I must draw attention to an urgent outstanding task. Over the past year, savings banks have performed an excellent job of self-criticism, reform and adaptation which, in my opinion, has only been partly publicised and explained to all parties interested in their welfare: the financial markets – on which they depend for the lifeblood of funds to conduct their activity – and the public, who are the ultimate beneficiaries of the banking services the savings banks provide. Businesses, balance sheets and income statements have been integrated, market values, capital gains and capital losses have been recognised, and assets have been written off in the concentration processes, which will be recorded in the accounts at year-end 2010. This overhaul and the key future milestones in the concentration processes (relating to resources, systems, human resources, etc.) have not been sufficiently communicated to all interested parties.  Consequently, a major communication drive is needed to explain the changes agreed, the assets and liabilities of the new financial statements (which are still pro-forma) and the pending concentration programme. This is because suspicions arise in the markets from time to time that these changes, rather than amounting to wholesale reform of the organisations concerned, are merely window-dressing. And this task of educating people must be performed before the wholesale markets re-open in about three weeks’ time. When that happens, the new treasury teams resulting from the concentration and merger of savings banks will have to use that detailed information as the basis for their demands for financial resources from euro area creditors. Without fluid communication, matters will be very complicated indeed. It is now that the true extent of the value added by good management comes into its own. You must take decisions, at times disagreeable ones, to protect profit margins, to reduce operating costs and overheads, to promote business activity, to control risks and liquidity, and to complete the integration of operations. In short, you will have to convince the euro financial markets to commit money to your projects, in the form of loans and capital, and all this must be done very rapidly and in an adverse environment. 4 BIS Review 173/2010 
BIS Review 173/2010 5 The new decade dawning in a few days will be as the old one, full of challenges but also full of hope that we will be able to pool the best of our abilities to contribute to a future the Spanish banking system merits. Allow me to wrap up by making a small correction so as to infuse some consistency in all I have said. At the beginning I thanked Caja Granada for the invitation to participate in this conference. I should like to clarify by saying that my thanks should really go to IPS “Mare Nostrum”. Thank you very much and Happy Christmas to you all. 
Miguel Fernández Ordóñez: Global rebalancing, asset prices and policy responses Opening remarks by Mr Miguel Fernández Ordóñez, Governor of the Bank of Spain, at the Fifth High-Level Seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American Central Banks, Madrid, 10 December 2010. *      *      * Good morning and welcome again.  More than three years after the global financial system started to show serious signs of instability and two years after being on the verge of a global economic and financial meltdown, the world economy seems to have avoided that risk, backed by a strong and coordinated policy response. Nevertheless, the strengthening has been uneven and the risk of economic and financial instability is still persistent and significant in some regions, like the euro area. Indeed, it is hard to emphasise sufficiently the challenges ahead and how crucial the present juncture is for the future of our Monetary Union.  On the contrary, Latin American economies had learned the lessons from the severe financial and economic disruptions they experienced in the not so distant past, and the challenges they currently face are more similar to those that characterised the period of strong growth prior to the financial crisis. These very different sets of present circumstances make today’s exchange of mutual experiences and policy discussion particularly interesting.  The title of today’s Seminar was chosen almost a year ago, but it couldn’t be more timely: Global Rebalancing, Asset Prices and Policy Responses. From today’s perspective, these three issues refer – more or less directly – to the basic challenges that will have to be tackled to make the present uneven and unbalanced global recovery sustainable.  With this in mind, I will organise my Opening Remarks around these three topics. First, I will deal with global rebalancing and how to achieve it in a context of diverging economic prospects for advanced and emerging market economies. Second, I will address the recent behaviour of global financial flows and the challenges that emerging market economies face in this regard, including the risk of asset price overvaluation. And finally, I will touch briefly upon the need to enhance policy cooperation at the global level, especially as some economies progressively leave the worst of the crisis behind. Let me move now to the first issue: global rebalancing and the world economic outlook. Although global imbalances were considered one of the major risks facing the world economy before the crisis, such risks did not finally materialise in the expected form of a disorderly adjustment of exchange rates, with disruptive effects on global financial stability. Nevertheless, even if large and unsustainable deficits financed by the accumulation of reserves by surplus emerging economies were not the ultimate cause of the global economic and financial crisis, it can still be argued that they provided support for the build-up of the financial excesses that led to it.  In the aftermath of the crisis, global imbalances were reduced as a consequence of the financial retrenchment and the severe downturn in activity worldwide. However, a large portion of the correction is likely to have been merely cyclical. As a matter of fact, as the global recovery is taking hold, a new widening of imbalances is starting to be perceived this year and is foreseen to continue into 2011. Indeed, the basic structural factors underlying global imbalances remain essentially in place; but the crisis has brought about some potentially important changes in the nature of the imbalances.  As trade and capital flows experienced a sudden stop during the crisis, the immediate impact was deeper in those economies more open to trade – which collapsed – and those with higher net external financing needs. When trade recovered, export economies tended to BIS Review 172/2010 1 
rebound strongly, but countries with large external deficits generally lagged behind. In many advanced economies, particularly in those running deficits, private domestic demand remains severely impaired by the adjustment process and the need for the private sector to deleverage. As a result of this process private sector saving rates have increased sharply and public sector balances have rapidly deteriorated. In the end, external deficits do not reflect anymore the large financing needs of the private sector – as they did before the crisis – but those of the public sector. High fiscal deficits and rapidly increasing debt levels in most advanced economies are both a consequence of the crisis and of the policy response to it, as Governments tried to make up for the sharp collapse in private sector activity and to support their financial sectors, in a context of rapidly shrinking public revenues. Given the deep concerns about public debt sustainability brought about by these developments, a key policy challenge in most advanced economies is to achieve fiscal consolidation, even at a time of expected lasting weakness in domestic demand.  European economies have been acting resolutely in the pursuit of fiscal consolidation. In particular, Spain is undergoing an intense adjustment process which has halved the current account deficit (from 9,6% in 2007 to around 5% this year). The Government is implementing an ambitious fiscal consolidation plan, combining some tax increases with sizable spending cuts and, more importantly, adjustments to long-term expenditures, in particular to the pension system, all of which will have a strong positive impact on the long-term sustainability of public finances.  But the success of the adjustment will depend first and foremost on achieving a solid and sustainable growth rate. This goal requires implementing the necessary structural reforms to increase productivity and the efficiency of the economy, and establishing a more balanced and stable pattern of growth. The most important of these reforms have already begun to be introduced, in particular those bearing on the labour market and the financial sector, but continuous progress is needed. The third pillar of the Spanish action plan is the restructuring of the financial sector and its adaptation to an economy less dependent on credit and leverage for growth. Restructuring turns on two essential aspects: the downsizing of the banking sector as a whole, and maintaining a sufficiently large backstop as to ensure the capital that is required, but using only that necessary so as not to overburden public debt, no matter how small the Spanish public debt is. The hard times that characterise a protracted process of economic and financial  adjustment are familiar to many Latin American countries, which have experienced sovereign and banking crises over the past decades. But they have avoided it this time. Indeed, Latin America has proved outstandingly resilient at a time of global hardship, as too have many emerging economies – perhaps with the exception of some Eastern European countries. Before the crisis, most Latin American countries had dramatically reduced their vulnerabilities, precisely as a result of the lessons learnt in the previous crisis. Accordingly, there were no severe problems of overborrowing or external imbalances of the sort experienced by industrial countries, and the current adjustment, while significant in size, has been swift. Recovery in Asia and Latin America is proving strong and driven increasingly by domestic demand.  All in all, improved fundamentals relative to industrial countries have placed emerging market economies in a much better position to resume high levels of growth. Going back to a debate that was popular in the first half of 2008, we can say that, after all, emerging countries have been able to “decouple” from the dire growth prospects of advanced economies.  But it is still uncertain whether solid growth in emerging economies can be sustained over the medium term if external demand from major industrial economies remains subdued for a protracted period. Moving one step forward, we can ask to what extent emerging economies can act as an effective engine for growth in advanced economies through their external 2 BIS Review 172/2010 
demand. There are clear incentives for emerging market economies to forcefully promote the growth of their domestic demand and contribute, at the same time, to rebalancing the world economy and to rendering global growth more sustainable.  Let me now turn to the second topic: financial flows and financial globalisation. Increased capital inflows into emerging market economies at a time of strong domestic growth is probably the central concern for these economies today; however, coming from a situation in which the risk of a “sudden stop” became very serious, at the end of 2008, the current bonanza does not appear such a bad outcome after all.  Yet large capital inflows together with strong domestic demand pressures combine to make for very expansionary economic conditions, posing risks to economic management in the form of overheating, inflation and appreciation pressures, credit booms and asset price overvaluation. Emerging economies have traditionally been more prone to “booms and busts” and “sudden stops” than more mature economies, and this helps to explain policy awareness when dealing with strong credit growth and currency volatility. Total capital inflows into emerging market economies, and also into Latin America, have strongly rebounded from the fall in late 2008 and 2009, and are expected to continue to grow over the medium term. Driving these developments are a combination of solid economic prospects and sizable interest rate differentials relative to advanced economies. Which of these two factors dominates is hard to say ex-ante but has important implications in terms of economic policy management of the situation.  On the one hand, if current capital inflows to emerging markets simply reflect their perceived relative economic strengths going forward, they should be expected to be largely permanent, and therefore, an appreciation of their exchange rates would be taken as granted. Such a choice would provide monetary policies with more degrees of freedom, allowing for a tightening more suited to their cyclical conditions, and for a rebalancing of growth towards domestic demand.  However, should short-term interest rate differentials also be playing a role in explaining this new wave of inflows, then the reluctance of emerging market countries to tolerate large appreciations would be understandable, also because the most dynamic components of the inflows – portfolio equity and debt flows – are the most volatile and subject to eventual reversals. However, limiting upward exchange rate flexibility may attract more capital inflows, on the expectation of future appreciations, turning thereby into a self-defeating strategy. In summary, choosing the right policy mix has become a challenging task for many emerging market economies, all the more so in the absence of a globally coordinated policy response.  Faced with these uncertain times, Latin American economies are applying a mix of policies to attain their multiple objectives and minimise risks. The mix includes, to differing degrees of intensity, monetary policy tightening, foreign exchange interventions and reserve accumulation, macro-prudential policies and, in some cases, capital controls.  The use of capital controls has traditionally been controversial, because they distort markets while their effectiveness is not backed by empirical evidence. But we must acknowledge that there has been a shift in opinion in their favour – at least as a last-resort instrument – even among institutions such as the IMF. In turn, this shift probably reflects a change in the perceived balance of benefits and costs associated with financial excesses.  Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind that capital controls can also entail negative externalities for the global economy. While fully convinced of the benefits of financial globalisation, a topic to which we devoted our Seminar in 2006, I am concerned by the risks of financial deglobalisation arising in the wake of the crisis. There is much discussion on the risks of trade protectionism as a consequence of the crisis, but the risks of financial protectionism are at least as significant and probably more evident. For instance, national rescue plans to address the financial crisis may have jeopardised the level playing field that must underpin cross-country financial flows. In a similar vein, capital controls could induce BIS Review 172/2010 3 
market segmentation and trigger a spiral which would erode some of the progress achieved in financial integration over the past decades.  Let me be more specific on banking flows and the lessons from the global financial crisis. The crisis has emphasised the vulnerability of cross-country banking flows, and how quickly they may retrench in times of stress. Such retrenchment was an important transmission channel of financial strain during the global financial crisis. However, not all banks behaved equally; lending by some proved more resilient than others. Recent research1 on the performance of cross-border lending to emerging markets during the recent crisis has yielded a number of interesting conclusions. Among them, that lending by Spanish banks to Latin America was more resilient than lending by other international banks, and that by behaving like domestic banks they did not contribute to the impact of foreign shocks on credit and interest rates.  The relative stability of Spanish banking flows has to do with both the banking business model and the quality of supervision. Spanish banks in Latin America have traditionally operated under a subsidiary model, whereby they are financially autonomous from the head office and they have to comply with the host country’s capital requirements and deposit insurance schemes. In turn, supervisory responsibility is shared between the host country and the home country supervisors. Another factor of resilience behind the business model of Spanish banks in Latin America is their focus on retail banking, which tends to be less volatile and more closely linked to the real economy than wholesale or investment banking. Both the emphasis on retail banking and the principle of financial autonomy of the subsidiaries induce banks to fund themselves primarily through the deposit base in the host country. This reliance on domestic funding has favoured “business as usual” even if the home country was enduring financial stress, and has helped to reduce the financial vulnerability of the host country by mitigating the exposure to external flows.  I am aware that even if the subsidiary model has proved its resilience during the crisis, it may involve some costs in terms of liquidity management, and that alternative banking models may have their virtues depending on the nature of the banking business. With due attention to limiting financial vulnerabilities, the question of models for cross-border banking has to be addressed with the necessary flexibility. In any case, the relatively mild recession and the favourable prospects for banking business in Latin America have encouraged Spanish banks to maintain or even increase their activity in the region at a time of hardship at home. This last factor is indeed an example of the benefits of preserving financial globalisation: strong economic prospects in Latin America have helped Spanish companies to build an important buffer against the deterioration in the domestic market, with an important contribution to our own financial stability.  Let me briefly address my third and final point today: the need to maintain the highest degree of global policy cooperation. The immediate crisis response by the international community was first coordinated in the revamped G20. The crisis showed, on the one hand, that the national policies of systemic economies had long neglected the spillovers of their own policies on other countries and, at the same time, that some of these policies entrenched unsustainable patterns of growth. In addition, as mentioned before, the crisis exposed countries to sudden and severe liquidity shortages. Against this background, the G20 has pledged a significant strengthening of both global surveillance and global financial safety nets.  The measures taken and the coordination involved highlight the remarkable unity achieved in response to the crisis. However, as the recovery gathers steam at different speeds, some                                                  1 See Kamil and Rai (2010), Galindo, Izquierdo and Rojas-Suarez (2009). 4 BIS Review 172/2010 
BIS Review 172/2010 5 dissent has surfaced. Although differences in policies are not completely unexpected now that the collapse scenario has been reduced, they do show that the international financial architecture still lacks sufficient leverage to coordinate the interests of the different countries.  Symptoms of imperfect coordination can be seen across the board today and, unfortunately, the euro area is no exception. As I have mentioned and illustrated above, a lack of coordination leads to national responses which can generate negative externalities. Recovering the sense of common purpose shared at the height of the crisis remains of the essence when designing the right policies at the global level. In these circumstances, it would be of paramount importance to reinforce the efforts to keep cooperation and dialogue open, and this Seminar is intended to contribute to that goal.  The other area where international cooperation is definitely needed is in the construction of global safety nets as a way to reduce global financial risks. A wider use could help mitigate certain policies that may be detrimental to global stability from a collective standpoint, such as excessive reserve accumulation. In that respect, additional work is needed to improve the incentives associated with IMF lending facilities for emerging market economies and to address more effectively the traditional problems associated with them (for instance, the stigma problem). International fora are well suited for resolving these coordination problems. That brings me to the end of my introduction to the Seminar. As you can see in the programme, there will be three sessions which will take up each of the topics I have just addressed. Each session has been organised as a panel discussion so as to facilitate the presentation and exchange of different views, with three panellists from both sides of the Atlantic. After each panel, we have allotted sufficient time for an open general discussion. Finally, at the end of today’s proceedings, President Trichet will make the closing remarks of the Seminar. I hope we will have an intense and very productive day’s discussion.  Without further delay, I give the floor to my friend Governor Carlos Costa, who will chair the first session of the seminar on global rebalancing. Thank you 
Stanley Fischer: Israel’s economy Summary of the address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the Israel Business Conference, Tel Aviv, 13 December 2010. *      *      * Israel’s economy is doing well, but there are still many long-term goals that need to be dealt with. Each one of them needs to be approached differently, and requires hard work and difficult decisions. I will outline what I consider to be the major challenges confronting us in the next decade. First, we must ask ourselves about the strategy that will lead us towards long-term growth. It is clear that Israel’s economy, like every open economy, must continue to be based on exports as the engine of growth and to be open to competition from other economies. The results of international tests showing a persistent decline in the relative achievements of Israeli students indicate that we must continue to promote the education system and to solve the problems it faces in all segments and across the entire age structure. The problem of education is directly connected with the problem of poverty, which in Israel is concentrated in two sectors in the population – the ultra-orthodox, and the Arab sector. Only 30 percent of ultra-orthodox men participate in the work force, with the inevitable result that a large part of that population is below the poverty line. In the Arab sector the main problem is the low level of employment of women, as well as discrimination, and the need to improve the education system. If we do not deal with these problems we will be unable to maintain our standard of living – that of the advanced economies. Israel also suffers from a lack of infrastructures, and related to that, from bureaucracy, slow decision making, and a low level of public-sector efficiency. Our geopolitical situation is clearly another factor; if that problem would be solved, the standard of living in the whole region, and in Israel too, would improve significantly. The problems I have enumerated till now are long-term ones. I will turn now to some short-term macroeconomic issues that come within the scope of the responsibility of the central bank. The main goal of the Bank of Israel, under the Bank of Israel Law passed by the Knesset this year, is the preservation of price stability, i.e., to keep inflation down to between 1 percent and 3 percent a year. In addition, the Bank’s objectives are to work towards the achievement of the other goals of the government’s economic policy, in particular growth, employment and the narrowing of social gaps, and to maintain the stability of the financial system and its proper functioning.  Recently inflation has been within the target range, and will probably remain within it until the end of this year. Inflation expectations for next year, however, are relatively high. As the expectations are around the upper limit of the target inflation range, this does not present a serious problem at this stage, but it is our task to ensure that inflation should not exceed the upper limit of the target. To achieve that requires a slightly tighter monetary policy. Let us turn now to the second goal, employment. The rate of unemployment, which increased during the crisis and declined during the recovery almost to its pre-crisis level, has recently risen slightly. This, in effect, is good news, as the unemployment rate has increased because of an increase in the rate of participation in the labor force, and not because of a drop in the number of employed persons. If the rate of participation had not risen, the rate of unemployment would today be about 5.5 percent. Our function is also to promote economic growth, and we therefore also keep an eye on developments in the exchange rate. The latest figures show that exports remained steady while imports declined, so that we expect the current account surplus to increase despite the relatively strong shekel exchange rate. Nonetheless, we must continue to support exports, BIS Review 172/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 172/2010 and we will therefore continue to intervene in the foreign currency market, and like every other country, we must be prepared for every possible economic scenario. With regard to financial stability, we are currently mainly concerned over developments in the housing market. The Ministry of Finance reports that prices of new houses have fallen, while the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) reports that overall housing prices continue to increase. Until the trends in the real estate market become clearer, the Bank of Israel must ensure that no bubble in housing prices develops that would harm financial stability. The best solution is to boost the supply of houses and thus lower their prices, and together with the Ministry of Finance we are examining ways of doing that. Meanwhile, as I said, we must ensure that financial stability is maintained. Another issue I would like to address is that of the medium term. The question is asked whether the recent discoveries of natural gas will have a major impact on Israel’s economy. It is too soon to answer. We have to continue encouraging the various investors to keep searching for gas, and must await results. The immediate issue here is that of royalties, reviewed by the Sheshinski Committee. I support the Committee’s approach, the aim of which is to find a way of dividing the gas profits between the entrepreneurs who search for and find the gas and Israel’s citizens. In this context I refer you to what I said when the Committee’s recommendations were published and I stand behind the views I expressed then. The gas discoveries raise a related issue, known as the Dutch disease. I have stated in the past that in my opinion the right way to deal with the problem is the Norwegian model, in which the royalties and the relevant government’s tax revenues are invested in a sovereign fund. The fund invests its income abroad, and the government’s income from this investment is more stable over time, and the fund moderates the short-term effect of the gas income on the exchange rate, an effect that could prove disastrous for the tradable goods industries, as happened in the Netherlands and other countries. I would now like to introduce the next speaker. Dr Jihad Al-Wazir, Governor and Chairman of the Board of the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), was born in 1963. Dr Al-Wazir obtained his Ph.D. in Business Administration from Loughborough University in the United Kingdom, and in the past served as Deputy Minister of Finance and Acting Minister of Finance in the Palestinian Authority. Relations between the Bank of Israel and the PMA under Dr Al-Wazir’s leadership are marked by effective and productive cooperation, and I hope that they will continue to be so. 
Deepak Mohanty: Investment and its financing – what causes private investment to remain relatively low in Asia? Welcome remarks by Mr Deepak Mohanty, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Conference on “Investment and its Financing: What causes private investment to remain relatively low in Asia?”, Mumbai, 16 December 2010. *      *      * 1. Mr. Peter Bekx, Director, European Commission. Mr. Subir Gokarn, Deputy Governor. Mr. Moreno Bertoldi, Head of Unit, European Commission. Ms. Valerie Rouxel-Laxton, Head of Sector, European Commission. Distinguished representatives from the ASEM member countries. Esteemed colleagues of central banks, representatives from multilateral organisations, think-tanks and academia, distinguished experts and friends. I am really privileged to have this pleasant opportunity of welcoming you all on the occasion of ASEM Conference on behalf of the Reserve Bank of India and on my own behalf. I understand that this is the first ASEM conference of European Commission in India. I thank the European Commission for this opportunity. 2. I am indeed honoured to welcome you all to this lovely city of Mumbai. As some of you may be aware, Mumbai has a unique place in Indian History and Commerce. Mumbai, built on seven islands, was the first British Indian possession. Mumbai came as a part of the royal dowry in 1661 to King Charles II of England on his marriage to the Portuguese princess. It was later leased to the East India Company for £10. Today you can’t get even a square inch of land in Mumbai for that price. Today Mumbai is one of most expensive cities in the world. Mumbai is the business capital of India and handles major share of India’s commerce. It houses the headquarters of many major banks, financial institutions, insurance companies and stock exchanges. Mumbai’s nature as the most eclectic and cosmopolitan Indian city is symbolized in the presence of Bollywood within the city, the centre of the globally-influential Hindi film and TV industries. The city has valiantly faced many setbacks and kept up its vibrancy. That is what Mumbai is! Be that as it may, I am sure, you will get an opportunity during your stay to go around the city and experience for yourself the brisk life of Mumbai. The Marine Drive which is just opposite this Hotel is popularly known as Queen’s necklace which you could see from the Rooftop where we will have our dinner tonight. I must also add that the weather is very pleasant at this time.  3. Now let me turn to today’s event. The Asia-Europe Meeting, generally known as ASEM, is the embodiment of Asia-EU collaborative involvement in the endeavour of enhancing growth opportunities in both these regions. The forum of ASEM provides a platform for useful dialogue at various levels between Asia and Europe on almost all issues of relevance ranging between finance, education, culture, climate, information technology and governance. The ASEM conference series which focus on topical issues provide useful inputs into ASEM dialogues. The ASEM conferences before, whether on finance or growth or terrorism, have brought in insights into the issues aiding policy making both in Europe and Asia. 4. The theme of the present conference – “Investment and its Financing: What causes private investment to remain relatively low in Asia” is topical and could not have come at a better time. It is particularly very important because of two main reasons. First, as we emerge from the financial storm of the last couple of years, investment has the key role to restore potential output to sustain aggregate demand. Second, investment growth in the emerging economies of Asia can play a pivotal role in the multi-speed recovery of the global economy characterized by protracted rehabilitation of over-extended balance sheets in the advanced economies. BIS Review 172/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 172/2010 5.  This platform, in my view, should be seen as a great opportunity to the academicians as well as policymakers of both Asia and Europe not only to learn from each other’s experiences but also to develop a vision for the realisation of faster and smoother growth trajectory. After every crisis, market agents, regulators, journalists and academics generally believe and persuade themselves that this time it is different. But it never is. There is a lot to learn from the past experiences of the crisis and the forum like ASEM conference can be immensely beneficial in sharing them. 6.  Let me now take this opportunity to discuss briefly about the format of the Conference. We will cover the conference theme in five sessions and a panel discussion. We begin with the keynote address by our Deputy Governor Dr. Subir Gokarn followed by the technical sessions and discussions. 7.  The first session will deal with what drives investment in Asia. The second session will delve deep into the issues related to investment and productivity growth in Asia. The third session will deal with credit growth and financial stability in the Asian countries. The fourth and the last session of today will be on the ways to improve the channelling of domestic saving to investment in Asia. We will resume tomorrow with the fifth session to discuss the role of financial sector and credit growth on investment. This will be followed by the panel discussion on the impact of infrastructure bottlenecks on Asian growth chaired by Dr. Y.V.Reddy, former Governor of Reserve Bank of India. 8.  Let me welcome you all once again. In the local language of Mumbai which is Marathi: Amchya Mumbait Tumha Sarvanche Swagat Aahe. You are welcome in our Mumbai. May these two days not only be marked with fruitful discussions but also bring closer the Asian and European communities in this increasingly globalised world. Thank you. 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Economic and Monetary Union – current situation Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the International Club of Economic Journalists, Frankfurt am Main, 13 December 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a true pleasure for me to participate in the meeting co-organised with the International Club of Frankfurt Economic Journalists. I vividly remember the interesting discussions we had in December 2008. At the time, I took the opportunity to discuss the changes in central banking communication. Today, I would like to focus on the current situation regarding Economic and Monetary Union.  Let me start by quoting from a famous speech that, according to the ancient Greek historian Thucydides, the Athenian statesman and leader Pericles delivered to his fellow citizens during the Peloponnesian War more than 2400 years ago: “Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration favours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a democracy.”1 As democracy in Periclean Athens 2400 years ago, the construction of Europe does not have established institutional patterns to copy. The European Union and the euro area are shaping new forms of cooperation and integration between sovereign states. The founding fathers of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) built the European house from its foundations. They could count neither on guidelines nor on predetermined rules. We are still progressing. An ambitious agenda lies in front of the European Leaders. It is a visionary agenda, and despite all the current challenges it is being pursued with determination.  Serious work is currently under way to underpin macroeconomic and financial stability in the euro area. We all know that it calls for determination, resolve and a solid sense of direction. For what concerns monetary policy, you can rest assured that the European Central Bank will continue to deliver the most efficient policy response and retain the posture of “credible alertness” that was adopted since the outbreak of the financial turmoil back in August 2007. This posture includes both standard monetary policy, which is implemented through interest rate changes, and non-standard policies, which are implemented, in essence, through special liquidity operations and interventions in some bond markets.  The ECB’s Governing Council has demonstrated a strong ability to preserve price stability during one of the most challenging period of modern monetary history, a period that could have led to a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.  Not surprisingly all advanced economies, being stressed by the worst financial and economic crisis since World War II, are called to reflect on the weaknesses of their economic and financial structures and on the appropriate reforms to redress their medium and long term macroeconomic and macro-financial strategies. This is the case in the United States. This is the case in Japan. It is the case in the European Union and in the Euro area as well. My plan for tonight is precisely to assess the institutional framework of the Euro area by highlighting the origin of the tensions we are currently experiencing and the plausible solutions that would help to restore market confidence and consolidate the building blocks of EMU.                                                   1  Thucydides (431 BC): The History of the Peloponnesian War (translated by Richard Crawley). BIS Review 171/2010 1 
As its name suggests, “Economic and Monetary Union” has two attributes: one is “Economic” and one is “Monetary.” The Monetary attribute of our Union refers to the ECB, its mandate and its independence. The “Economic” aspect of our Union comprises the fiscal regime enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact; the national frameworks of economic policy, including macroeconomic policy and financial supervision; and the system of mutual surveillance.  The developments we are currently witnessing in Europe’s economy have to do with its “Economic” functions. They have essentially three origins: unsound fiscal policies in a number of member states; inappropriate macroeconomic and supervisory policies in a number of member states; and overall an inadequate system of surveillance. This is the triangle that lies behind the current situation. And let me make this very clear: the triangle does not include monetary policy.  *** The “monetary” side: price stability in the euro area  The “M” side of the EMU is relatively straightforward to assess. The Treaty assigns the ECB the primary responsibility for maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term. We now have almost 12 years of experience with the euro: this is a sufficiently long span of time to provide an evaluation of how successful the ECB has been in delivering on its mandate. You all know that from the outset the ECB has set itself a very clear numerical benchmark, which is a public and transparent yardstick. The ECB’s Governing Council has defined price stability to be an annual rate of inflation in the euro area of below 2% over the medium terms. The Governing Council has also declared that, in pursuing its mandate, it aims – within that range of values – at an inflation rate over the medium terms close to 2%.  Let me emphasize that the track record is solid. Over the first 12 years of existence of the euro, the average annual inflation rate in the euro area has been 1.97%. This is the best result in the euro area for at least 50 years and despite the number of economic and political shocks we had to face since we began, in 1999, with a new institution, a new currency and a new framework for monetary policy-making. It has been achieved in an environment of positive growth that in per capita terms was virtually the same as in the United States. It has been achieved in an environment of employment growth with employment rising by over 14 million. And it has been achieved for an entire continent of 330 million people.  Furthermore, over the same period, inflation expectations have generally been aligned with our definition of price stability. Even at the height of the financial crisis, in a situation of high uncertainty, inflation expectations have remained anchored. Today, as witnessed by the October reading of the Consensus Forecast, as well as of the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Euro zone Barometer, they remain anchored, with both readings at 1.9% at a 5 years horizon. The more recent Eurosystem staff economic projections – that spans a shorter time horizon – also reflect the stability of inflation looking forward.  Our monetary policy strategy has communicated a clear sense of direction. The sustained anchoring of expectations has made it possible for the ECB to ease its policy stance in response to the crisis without entering pre-commitments about the future path of the policy rate. Our definition of price stability has guided our citizens in their economic decisions and has acted as a built-in stabiliser in the deepest phases of the crisis.  The “economic” side: sound and sustainable fiscal policy Let me now turn to the main contention of my remarks: the tensions we are experiencing today in the Euro area sovereign debt markets find their deep causes in the countries’ policy 2 BIS Review 171/2010 
slippages of the past years. These slippages are all concentrated on the “E” side of EMU. First, fiscal policies in some countries have not been aligned with the requirements laid out in the Stability and Growth Pact. Second macroeconomic policies in some Euro area countries were not fully consistent with the participation in a monetary union that is founded on price stability.  To be sure, looking at the euro area as an aggregate, and comparing the euro area with its major global partners, the fiscal problem appear relatively modest. Next year, the average Euro area budget deficit will be in the order of 4.6%. By 2012 it is expected to decline further to 3.9% (Source EC Autumn 2010 economic forecast). These expected numbers are about half the corresponding expected figures for the US and Japan. The problem, the source of the current tensions clearly reside with national fiscal developments, notably localised in those countries that have not done enough to correct imbalances or to prepare for difficult times, when times were still good. We know that for several years, fiscal policies in some European countries have breached both the letter and the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact calls for budgets that are close to balance or in surplus over the cycle, deficits always below 3% of GDP and a public debt level of below 60% of GDP. When a few years ago it became clear that in some important countries fiscal policies would not be able to meet the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, it was not the policies that were changed but the Pact. This was clearly a dark moment in the history of European policy decision making. In 2004 and 2005, the governments of the three largest Member economies coalesced to try and dismantle the Stability and Growth Pact. It was a very fierce battle at the time, and the ECB publicly voiced its grave concerns.  The recent crisis has demonstrated that growing underlying macroeconomic imbalances can also destabilise fiscal policies and place a country on an unsustainable trajectory. A boom-bust cycle can mask a fiscal problem for a long time and suddenly expose the problem when it turns. High fiscal elasticities tend to curb budget deficits – and even produce overall surpluses – when asset price run-ups boost revenues from financial and housing transactions. The same elasticities, however, will send the budget into distress when the boom reverses.  The second area of policy slippage concerns macroeconomic policies. Here what stands clearly in front of the policymakers is the sustained increase in unit labour costs whose growth in some member countries has consistently outpaced both domestic inflation and euro-area average union labour costs. Such competitiveness losses cannot be sustained forever, and catching-up phenomena can only explain a limited part of the process. Sooner or later adjustments in unsustainable economic policies have to be made. Fiscal and structural policies need to keep domestic demand in line with rates of sustainable growth and price stability.  Reinforced fiscal surveillance, for all its critical importance, is not enough. We need to scrutinise more closely the macroeconomic policies. We need reinforced macroeconomic surveillance. You know that the monitoring of fiscal and macroeconomic policies in the European Union and the Euro area is performed by peer group fora: the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings of finance ministers. The European Commission typically supports the activity of these fora. Of course, effective monitoring requires adherence by members to the policy framework, it requires peer pressure and consequences to deal with deviant behaviour, and it requires reliable statistics.  Europe’s economy: the current challenges and the way ahead Let me come to the third part of my remarks: what is expected of national governments and of European Union institutions?  BIS Review 171/2010 3 
Starting from fiscal policies, in some countries there remain significant concerns about the sustainability of their own fiscal positions. It is not possible to procrastinate further the solution to these problems and fiscal authorities need to act in order to strengthen public confidence in sound public finances, thereby reducing risk premia in interest rates and supporting sustainable growth over the medium term. More generally, all euro area governments should step up consolidation efforts in a way that is credible and lays the foundation for sustainable long-term growth. To this end, it is essential that countries pursue credible multi-year consolidation plans and fully implement the planned consolidation measures. Positive fiscal developments that may emerge, reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected economic environment, should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation. In their 2011 budgets, countries need to specify the necessary fiscal adjustment measures in detail, while standing ready to correct any slippages from the fiscal objectives announced.  In this context, let me express the appreciation of the Governing Council for the economic and financial adjustment programme which was recently agreed by the Irish government with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund. I am sure that the programme is suited to bring about a sustainable stabilisation of the Irish economy and sooth the tensions in financial markets that are associated with the Irish fiscal problems and the reorganisation of its banking sector. Furthermore, by addressing in a decisive manner the economic and financial causes underlying current market concerns the programme will also contribute to restoring confidence and safeguarding financial stability in the euro area as a whole.  Equally important is that structural reforms are rapidly implemented that enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth especially in those countries that have accumulated over the past years significant loss of competitiveness or are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits. Removing labour market rigidities and increasing product market competition – particularly in the services sectors – would further support the adjustment process of these economies. Measures working in this direction will also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and foster innovation, productivity growth, which ultimately leads to sustainable long-term economic growth. At the current stage it cannot be stresses enough how important it is that the banking sector of the euro area be appropriately restructured. By repairing their own balance sheets, implementing sound and effective risk management strategies the banks in the euro area will increase their resilience to domestic and external shocks, which would allow them to make their contribution to sustainable growth and financial stability. Finally, let me state clearly – also on behalf of the Governing Council of the ECB – that we are not completely satisfied of the proposals put forward by the Commission and the European Council Task Force that should aim at strengthening the system of economic governance in Europe. These proposals in our view do not yet represent the quantum leap in economic governance that is needed to be fully commensurate with the monetary union we have created. Most important, we need to strengthen in particular two areas of the economic and financial structure in the EU. The first area is the surveillance on domestic fiscal policies with a view to preventing excessive deficits and unsustainable public debt. The second one is the adoption of a mutual surveillance framework on macroeconomic policies in the euro area focussing on those countries which experience sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits as these countries face the greatest sustainability challenges.  To be specific, I think that for these two broad areas, one can highlight six main lines of reform that the ECB deems it is necessary to purse further. Starting from the fiscal policy side, I am convinced that, as far as the euro area is concerned, one should: 1. The deadlines for action on the side of governments under excessive deficit procedures should be shortened, and the system of sanctions should operate much 4 BIS Review 171/2010 
earlier in the EDP process. In the past lenient applications of the rules were exploited by short-sighted policymakers for irresponsible delays in adjustments and laid the premises for the current situation. 2. Sanctions should be applied in a way that is quasi-automatic and based on clearly defined criteria and with less discretion over outcomes. This will mean, first to diversify the spectrum of possible financial and non-financial enforcement mechanisms. Among the financial mechanisms, I include fines, deposits and reduced access to EU funds. Under the non-financial mechanisms, I include country missions, recommended adjustment programmes, possible limitations of voting rights for Member State in persistence violation. Quasi-automaticity will also imply the limitation of the scope for discretional intervention at the political level, for example by implementing to the maximum possible extent the “reversal of voting majorities” at the European Council.  3. Place more ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% ceiling. We should assign the debt criterion the importance it is given in the Treaty by combining a clear and sufficiently ambitious rule on public debt reduction with the prescriptions on deficit developments that are typically the exclusive focus of EDP procedures.  For what concerns the mutual surveillance framework, three other main lines of reform are necessary in our opinion: 1. The design of a transparent procedure that clearly specifies the sanctions in case of breach of sustainability rules. Identification of Member States with vulnerabilities should be done on the basis of clear and undisputable quantitative indicators which should not be left to the sole discretion of the Commission. We have advocated that a specific scoreboard should be designed for euro area Member States which would trigger a quasi-automatic in-depth analysis and reinforced monitoring. A detailed and self-contained scoreboard offers a concrete basis for assessment. Furthermore, it restricts the scope open to countries to arbitrage across indicators and monitoring dimensions. 2. The procedure should be transparent in order to give the possibility to the general public and to market participants to appreciate the evolution of the process, from the stage at which macroeconomic imbalances are detected and assessed, to the stage at which recommendations for corrective actions are issued. Transparency in this case reinforces – rather than weakens – the teeth of the procedures. 3. The increase in the quality and independence of the economic analysis that underpins the surveillance exercises. It is important that the Commission is permitted to assess not only national budgets, but also the individual budgetary measures taken by Member States and have the right – in liaison with the ECB – to carry out missions to Member States in order to assess the budgetary situation. Ancillary to this last point, we need to bring the reliability of statistical data to the highest possible level.  It is my opinion that in order to pursue these lines of reform we need to give the Commissioner himself and the Commission services charged with conducting macroeconomic and fiscal surveillance for the euro area the highest degree of independence possible within the Commission, ideally supported by a body of “wise persons” providing external assessments. Let me conclude with an example that demonstrates that in Europe policymakers can make bold steps when and where necessary. I am referring to the recent decisions of the European Council and the European Parliament to create the European Systemic Risk Board – or ESRB – which I shall have the honour to chair.  BIS Review 171/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 171/2010 This new European body will be part of the new European System of Financial Supervision and its function will be to provide macro-prudential oversight of the EU financial system. It will bring together the governors of the national central banks, the new European Supervisory Agencies, the Commission and the national supervisory authorities of all 27 member states.  The establishment of the ESRB will be a landmark event in how Europe deals preventively with systemic risk. It will complete the European construction in the direction of adding safeguards that will stabilise the financial system and make Europe’s economy more stable and resilient in the medium terms. Furthermore, it will facilitate multilateral dialogue and cooperation in the field of macro prudential oversight with similar institutions in other countries, including the US and the newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC). Conclusion The ECB has, I trust, been living up to its responsibility and delivered what had been promised to our people: a stable currency that has promoted economic growth and job creation. This has not been an easy journey and we had to drive on rocky roads and absorb various shocks, including food and oil price gyrations as well as the consequences of the terrible terrorist attacks in the US. Over these years, the euro has always been a force for stability and it remains so also in what is now a more than three-year period of economic and financial instability. In Europe, as in all other major advanced economies, we are now called to react to the challenges posed by the crisis. Changes are needed in the euro area involving both our economic models and surveillance frameworks. Taking into account the lessons to be drawn from the global crisis in terms of functioning of the Economic Union, it appears of the essence to pursue greater cooperation and greater cohesion through a economic governance that will be considerably reinforced. We must keep our sense of direction: towards more European unity and more responsible European unity. Thank you for your attention. 
Muhammad Al-Jasser: Small and medium enterprises Opening speech by His Excellency Dr Muhammad Al-Jasser, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), at the symposium on “Small and Medium Enterprises”, organized by the Institute of Banking in cooperation with the International Financing Corporation, Riyadh, 2 November 2010. *      *      * Excellencies and honored audience, It gives me great pleasure to welcome you all in the headquarters of the Institute of Banking. I’m delighted to receive an invitation to deliver the opening speech for the symposium on “Small and Medium Enterprises” before this distinguished elite of participants and audience. I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the colleagues at the Institute of Banking and International Finance Corporation (IFC) for organizing this symposium. I will try in this speech to shed light on some ideas related to the importance of the role of these enterprises in the national economy, challenges facing their growth, and provision of appropriate funding for them. Dear audience, The national economy consists of an integrated wide range of public and private enterprises which utilize available material and human factors of production for providing continuous flows of goods and services to meet the needs of the domestic society and part of external demand. As a matter of fact, the sizes of local firms vary according to the size of labour, capital, sales…etc. It is mistakenly believed that large-scale enterprises are the main impetus for economic activity. Such belief has stemmed from the attention paid to these entities by different mass media. However, the true state of affairs emphasizes that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in the economic activity in both advanced and developing countries through their massive absorption capacity to employ labour force, including those with modest and average training and scientific qualifications, apart from their role in the daily movement of goods, services and commercial activity. For instance, small and medium enterprises in the Euro area account for 99.8 percent of total business enterprises, 60 percent of value added, and 70 percent of total employment. Such percentages are not confined to the Euro area only, but many other countries in the world may have similar percentages as well. Small and medium enterprises are considered the most efficient and capable instrument to accelerate the pace of economic and social development, especially in remote areas with less opportunity to benefit from development. Apart from being the nucleus of large-scale enterprises, small and medium enterprises provide a fertile environment for training workers and developing their skills; and help in speeding up the turnover of small amounts of invested funds. Based on this perspective, governments have long since paid great attention to such enterprises and enacted laws to provide the infrastructure that would contribute to their growth and development, particularly after having proved their capacity to reduce pressure on the public sector as regards the provision of job opportunities. Moreover, small and medium enterprises serve as a wide arena for developing workers’ technical and management skills. They also assist large enterprises in the marketing process and providing crude materials and primary commodities throughout the phases of production.  Most regional and international donor institutions and organizations have a growing tendency to provide financial resources and technical assistance to these small and medium enterprises to be self-dependent and play their necessary role in the economy.  Dear audience, Some may wonder what small and medium enterprises are, how we can differentiate between them and do they have an international definition. In fact, there is much difference in BIS Review 171/2010 1 
their definition at the international level, and it is difficult to reach a uniform definition. If we depend on the capital criterion, for example, we will find that an enterprise with a capital of 10 million Euros is considered a small-sized enterprise in the European Union while it is regarded as a medium or probably large enterprise in some developing countries. Moreover, “small” and “medium” are two comparative words and have relative concepts that vary from one sector to another and from one country to another. However, the general practice in every country or region is to depend on a number of criteria, including manpower numbers, capital, volume of annual sales and total financial position at the end of the period. In the European Union region, small enterprises are defined as those having 50 workers and an activity volume of 10 million Euros, while medium ones are those with 250 workers and an annual activity volume of 50 million Euros. In the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Industrial Development Fund adopts the criterion of the annual sales for defining small and medium enterprises whose annual sales do not exceed Rls 20 million for financing purposes according to “Kafallah” program. The World Bank has distributed a questionnaire to commercial banks to determine a definition for small and medium enterprises. The result of the questionnaire has showed that there is difference in banks’ definitions. However, it may be concluded that small enterprises are those with annual sales ranging from Rls 100 thousand to Rls 5 million and workers from 2 to 49. Medium enterprises are those with annual sales from Rls 5 million to 50 million and workers from 50 to 200. Dear audience, SMEs are characterized by many features including, simplicity of their establishment due to the low value of the capital needed for their foundation and operation, simplicity of their establishment procedures, and low cost of their establishment and administration because of the simplicity of their administrative structure. Moreover, SMEs are featured by the independent management by their owners who seek as much success as possible. Their other features are: low administrative and marketing cost, and labor wages, simple routine procedures, highly efficient communications and readily available information needed for work therein, the usage of uncomplicated production and operation methods, the ability to cope with new changes with regard to meeting consumers’ preferences and tastes, the ability to change the composition of labor force, production, marketing or finance polices to face quick changes without any hesitation, helping them to overcome economic cycles and changes. In addition, SMEs are also characterized by the freedom to enter and exit the market because of the modest ratio of their liabilities to fixed or full assets, and the easiness to convert small enterprises into liquidity in a short time without incurring a significant loss. Furthermore, the exit of a SME will have no significant impact on the market. Finally, SMEs are flexible to move and spread geographically. In spite of these features, the growth of SMEs is facing a variety of challenges which may be similar to a great extent not only at the level of one country only, but also at the global level. The most prominent challenges are the high cost of capital as a result of high interest rates compared to large enterprises (LEs), the difficulty of obtaining proper finance due to shortage of guarantees and modest credit record, inability to compete and affect the market’s powers and making advantage of economies of scale as is the case with LEs, weak capacity to face and facilitate governmental procedures to expand their work, and low spending on development research works. Dear audience, Business enterprises in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have witnessed notable growth over the last years. The enterprises subscribing to the Social Insurance system have increased from 121.5 thousand in 1426AH to 218.4 thousand in 1430AH, with an average annual growth of 16 percent. Individual enterprises represent 93.1 percent, limited partnership enterprises 4.7 percent, and joint enterprises 0.6 percent of the total number. These enterprises’ economic activity is concentrated in three areas, namely, commerce with 34.3 percent, construction and building with 32.3 percent, and manufacturing industries with 14.6 percent. Small enterprises employing less than five persons have accounted for the bulk share, representing 45.5 percent of total enterprises at the end of 1430AH, enterprises with 2 BIS Review 171/2010 
BIS Review 171/2010 3 5–59 employees constitute 42 percent, while the remaining 3.8 percent has been accounted for by enterprises with more than 60 employees. These data show that most enterprises in Saudi Arabia are small ones, based on the number of employees. The SME’s contribution to total GDP is low. The share of private sector gross product, which SMEs are part of, is 33 percent, while the share of SMEs in GDP is 57 percent in Japan, 64.3 percent in Spain, 56 percent in France, 44 percent in Austria, 43 percent in Canada, 33 percent in Australia and more than 50 percent in the United States. The SME’s modest contribution to GDP in Saudi Arabia could be ascribed to the immensity of the oil and public sectors, being the main catalyst for economic activity. SMEs coverage in the national income accounts might be low. Dear audience, Small and medium enterprises are facing clear challenges to obtain the necessary funding to meet their expansion needs because of several reasons; one of which is the lack of guarantees for granting credit. To overcome this problem in the Kingdom, the Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with Saudi banks, has established “Kafalah Program” for financing small and medium enterprises. It is a program administered by the Saudi Industrial Development Fund with a capital of Rls 200 million to cover a proportion of the risk of the funding entity in case the guaranteed enterprise fails to repay the finance or part thereof, and to encourage banks to finance viable small and medium enterprises, which cannot provide the necessary guarantees or accounting records that prove their eligibility for funding. The program has been performing well since its inception in 2006 up to the end of 2010. The number of guarantees approved during the period amounted to 1,668 with a total value of Rls 644 million against loans to the tune of Rls1.6 billion granted by banks under the umbrella of the program, which benefited about 1,113 small and medium enterprises. This is in addition to loans provided by the Saudi Credit and Savings Bank, for financing young people and small enterprises, as well as the Centennial Fund, and Abdul Latif Jameel’s “Finance Program” that provides material support for youth’s projects and training courses. Dear audience, In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that the status of small and medium enterprises in the Kingdom still needs a lot of care and an appropriate environment to perform their required roles in the economy, especially in the field of Saudization of jobs. This important symposium may, hopefully, discuss this topic from its different aspects and provide the necessary recommendations to assist competent authorities in making appropriate decisions for this important sector. Thank you all for listening and wish you success. 
Shahid H Kardar: Understanding inflation and SBP’s monetary policy stance Address by Mr Shahid H Kardar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, to the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Karachi 13 December 2010. *      *      * The debate on the role of monetary policy in ensuring macroeconomic stability in general and price stability in particular has intensified after the global financial and economic crisis of 2008/2009. While it may take some time before a consensus emerges on the appropriate monetary policy strategy, almost all economists and central bankers in global policy circles, whether they favor or criticize the current monetary policy stance, still believe that containing inflation is and should be the fundamental objective of monetary policy.  In Pakistan, a similar debate, albeit with different backdrop and parameters, on the causes of inflation and role of monetary policy has intensified over the last few years. Most observers agree that inflation, which is persisting at a high level for almost three years now, is one of the major economic issues currently faced by the country. However, they are skeptical about the effectiveness of monetary policy in bringing it down. Some commentators believe that it is entirely a “supply-side” phenomenon and monetary policy cannot play any role in containing inflation. Others cite fiscal weaknesses and the large budgetary deficit as the main reason for inflation and point out that monetary policy cannot influence the behavior of the government.  In my remarks today, I would like to share with you my thoughts and perspectives on this important topic. We, at SBP, firmly believe that implementing a coherent strategy for monetary policy may not be enough if the elements of the strategy are not sufficiently well communicated or understood, and if the responsibility for the outcomes of the monetary policy stance is not clearly delineated. But, before I get into the specifics of inflationary phenomenon in Pakistan and discuss the rationale for SBP’s current monetary policy stance, I would like to discuss three conceptual points. First, the process of price determination at the basic level. Second, the behavior of inflation. Third, understanding the trade-offs faced by policy makers. This discourse would not only help us in appreciating the scope and effectiveness of monetary policy but also the limits and constraints faced by the State Bank in achieving its objectives.  It is important to understand the relationship between the cost of producing a good and its price at the firm level before any discussion on the causes of inflation in an economy. Suppose it costs Rs10 to produce a good, which includes the wage bill, cost of raw-material, acquiring and installing machines, and all other expenses. To remain in the business and earn profits, the producer would like to sell it at Rs10 plus “x”. The Rs“x” is generally termed as a mark up and depends on the degree of competition in the industry, nature of the product, overall administrative efficiency of producers and government authorities, adequate supply-chain infrastructure etc. What is over-looked in this simplistic example is the role of productivity of the factors of production, be it workers or machines. If the productivity is low and declining, then the final price tends to be higher even if the cost of acquiring the factors of production remains the same. Put differently, the price can be kept stable or even reduced by increasing the productivity of workers and better and efficient use of technology. The monetary policy stance geared towards containment of overall inflation and thus stability of prices eases the pressures on the cost of production but cannot increase the productivity. Factors positively influencing productivity include stable law and order conditions, a healthy and skilled labor force, effective governance, and uninterrupted availability of energy. A micro-level understanding of the price determination process is helpful, but a discussion on the behavior of prices or inflation at the aggregate level is also important. Three broad BIS Review 171/2010 1 
parameters are worth mentioning in this regard: i)- expectations about the continuation of inflationary trends; ii)- the output gap or the difference between aggregate domestic demand and the ability and capacity of the economy to meet that demand; and, iii)- cost push or supply shocks. Expectations of likely inflation path have strong feedback effects on actual inflation. Such expectations could be based on past inflationary trends or may be formed by the expected impact of government policies, or lack thereof, on inflation. For example, if an economy experiences high and rising inflation for some time then people tend to expect that this trend would continue and seek higher wages to at least maintain their purchasing power. Typically, adjustment in wages tends to be slower than increases in the prices of goods and services that people consume. This leads to discontent and pressure on government authorities to control inflation and keep it stable. Thus, managing the expectations of inflation by devising and implementing consistent and predictable economic policies is a critical task which is normally performed by central banks around the globe. However, the supporting role of other policies, such as fiscal policy, in assuring the public that the government is pursuing anti-inflationary policies should not be underestimated. Failure to do so in a credible manner creates uncertainty and distorts the decisions of the general public and businesses. In turn, this exacerbates inflationary pressures. Regarding the impact of a “gap” in output on inflation, an important point is that aggregate demand alone cannot explain inflation. It should be compared to the ability of the economy to produce and supply that demand. Thus, inflationary pressure can exist in an economy even if the aggregate demand is relatively contained. In other words, if the productive capacity of the economy is decreasing, inflation can persist with the same level of aggregate demand.  However, assessing the prevailing output gap is a difficult task for economic mangers. It involves judging the capacity or potential of the economy, which is almost impossible to measure. Lack of timely availability of relevant data on aggregate demand, such as consumption and investment expenditures of the private and public sector, further complicates the task. The authorities, therefore, tend to rely on available indicators that help in assessing aggregate demand pressures and the productive capacity of the economy.  The behavior of monetary variables, such as credit demand of the private sector and fiscal authorities and trends in the foreign exchange reserve position of the country, serve as useful leading indicators of aggregate demand. The reason is that most transactions taking place in the economy involve the use of money, whether in the documented or undocumented parts of an economy. Not surprisingly, phrases like “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” and “too much money chasing too few goods” are used to describe inflationary pressures. Supply shocks include unexpected shocks to the cost of production, natural disasters that affect the production and the supply chain, and intervention in markets through administrative measures. Such factors typically have a temporary effect on the level of prices but do not influence the rate of change of prices, that is, inflation. Importantly, if such shocks continue to hit the economy at regular intervals, as is the case with reduction in electricity and petroleum subsidies in Pakistan, then their effect filters into other prices and fuels inflationary expectations. The last conceptual point that I want to highlight is that every economic policy decision entails a trade-off among desirable impact on key variables. We cannot have everything that we wish without paying a price. For example, we all understand that a rise in aggregate demand relative to the available productive capacity leads to inflation. An effort to contain inflation through a tight monetary policy stance tends to have a dampening effect on economic activity. In most instances, the adjustments that the private sector has to make are more pronounced compared to those made by the public sector. 2 BIS Review 171/2010 
Similarly, deterioration in the external accounts, either because of a large gap between payments and receipts or lack of funds to finance it, cannot continue without an adjustment in the exchange rate. Attempts to maintain stability in the exchange rate by supplying the required foreign currency cannot be achieved on a sustained basis without interest rate increases. The reason is because injection of foreign currency by a central bank, when the outflow of foreign currency in the country is greater than the inflow, requires purchase of domestic currency in exchange. This reduces availability of liquidity of domestic currency, which pushes up market interest rates. To ease the liquidity pressures, the central bank can inject the domestic currency through its normal Open Market Operations. However, this strategy becomes difficult to maintain if the foreign currency outflows continue to remain higher than inflows and if the domestic inflation starts to increase because of ample availability of domestic currency. The same principle applies to fiscal matters. The governments cannot for long periods continue to spend more than the revenues it mobilizes. The amount of borrowings required to close the gap comes with a cost – interest payments in the future. Failure to increase revenues in proportion to increases in expenditures compounds the problem as the interest expense continue to rise, leading to more borrowings and rising debt levels. Measures to raise revenues such as increases in taxes or cuts in expenditures such as reduction in subsidies tend to increase the cost of production and possibly inflation. The point I am essentially trying to make is that for a policy decision to be effective adjustment in some area of the economy is required. If the required adjustment is not taking place or if there are other policies that are diluting or neutralizing it, then the credibility of decision makers suffers, leading to uncertainty. What is required is that policy makers articulate an agenda of priorities for the future of the economy, communicate it to the general public, develop political consensus, take timely and coordinated decisions, and implement the agenda over a number of years. Delays or uncertainty in any aspect of this strategy results in less than desirable outcomes making the trade-offs among key priorities tougher.  Against this conceptual backdrop, let’s talk about the specifics of the current high inflation phenomenon in Pakistan and the role of monetary policy in dealing with the issue. In cumulative terms, Pakistan’s economy has experienced an inflation of 66 percent between October 2010 and June 2007. This is almost twice the level of inflation seen during June 2003 and June 2007, which was 36 percent. What makes the last three years so different from the three years before that? To begin, let’s dissect the inflation data a bit to shed light on this issue, starting with food prices. The behavior of food group, which has a share of 40 percent in the overall Consumer Price Index (CPI), is not much different across these periods. It is true that food prices grew by 88 percent between June 2007 and October 2010 and by 47 percent between June 2003 and June 2007. But, their share in CPI inflation in both these periods is not much different; 56 and 51 percent respectively. Moreover, virtually the same items across these time periods are responsible for 80 percent of food inflation. Key among these are wheat flour, sugar, fresh milk, meat, and vegetables. So, is this food inflation entirely because of “supply shocks”? Is there anything different that can be highlighted? Let’s take the example of wheat and sugar. Between June 2003 and June 2007, the price of a 10 kg bag of wheat increased from Rs85 to Rs119; a cumulative price increase of 40 percent. In the next three years, it increased to Rs260; a cumulative price increase of 120 percent. But, the international price of wheat increased by only 22 percent. So, what happened? Did productivity collapse or input prices just shot up? We all know that the government increased the “support price” of wheat. Would we consider it a supply shock or a policy decision? Same is the case with sugar prices. After increasing by 46 percent during June 2003 and June 2007, the sugar prices increased by 184 percent in the next three years. The point here is that such price increases cannot be considered as pure supply shocks. For instance, the government would not have been able to procure more than 10 million tons of BIS Review 171/2010 3 
wheat at higher than its international price without borrowing extensively from the banking system. Not surprisingly, the credit extended for “commodity operations”, including both wheat and sugar, grew by 288 percent during the last three years compared to 33 percent in the three years before that. Borrowings of this scale would not have been possible without an upward pressure on market interest rates. Thus, the borrowings of government agencies for financing its wheat, urea, and sugar trading operations is Rs382 billion at just under 3 percentage points above KIBOR, indicating the interest rate regime that the private sector would have to face in competition with the sovereign. Further, this led to an injection of a lot of cash in the rural areas, which was used for higher expenditures on consumer durables and possibly other food items as well. Thus, an initial “supply shock” turned into a “demand shock” and adversely affected expectation of inflation remaining high. To further understand the difference between price setting at the commodity level and the aggregate level, let’s look at the evolution of prices of petroleum products, electricity and gas. Traditionally, these prices have been heavily subsidized by the government. So, one would expect that this approach would keep a lid on the prices of these products in the market. And when these subsidies are scaled back, the increase in their prices and the impact on overall inflation would become pronounced. A careful look at the data reveals that this is not necessarily the case. For example, the price of diesel increased from Rs20 per liter to Rs38 per liter during June 2003 and June 2007 – a cumulative increase of 90 percent – and has increased to Rs79 per liter by October 2010 – an increase of another 108 percent. The difference is not that large to claim that this is the main reason for a relatively higher rate of inflation in the last three years. In fact, in case of price of petrol the opposite is true. It grew by 37 percent between June 2007 and October 2010 and by 72 percent between June 2003 and June 2007.The increases in the price of electricity were, however, sharper in recent years; 62 percent on average compared to 5 percent respectively. On the other hand, the borrowings of Public Sector Enterprises, which partially explains transfer of subsidies from the government’s budgetary expenditures directly to the power sector entities, grew by 305 percent during October 2010 and June 2007 compared to only 17 percent during 2003 and June 2007. The contribution of this towards growth in money and thus overall inflation should not be discounted. However, even if we exclude the food and energy group prices from CPI, we observe substantial increase in inflationary pressures. Both non-food-non-energy (NFNE) and trimmed measures of core inflation validate this observation. For example, NFNE grew by 58 percent in the last three years compared to 28 percent in the three years before that. Did the reduction in subsidies help in reducing the fiscal deficit and easing aggregate demand pressure? Unfortunately, it did not happen. In cumulative terms, the fiscal deficit grew by 146 percent in nominal terms during June 2007 and June 2010 compared to 113 percent during June 2003 and June 2007. If we take out the interest payments, which have been mentioned as a factor adding to the fiscal problems, and look at the primary deficit, the fiscal driven aggregate demand pressures look more pronounced. The primary deficit grew by 3182 percent in the last three years compared to an improvement of 140 percent in the three years before that. The same is the case with revenue deficit – the difference between current expenditures and total revenues. This deficit increased by 298 percent compared to only 27 percent respectively. Thus, there is an unquestionable increase in aggregate demand pressure because of the public sector. What is more worrying is the trend in the financing pressures of this substantial fiscal expansion on the resources of the banking system. During June 2007 and November 2010, the cumulative borrowings from the banking system increased by 187 percent compared to 58 percent during June 2003 and June 2007.We all know that, within the banking system, the government has substantially increased its reliance on borrowing from the SBP. The stock of outstanding borrowings of the government from the SBP is in excess of Rs1500 billion today compared to only Rs53 billion at end-June 2003. Imagine the effect on market interest rate if the government had borrowed this amount from the scheduled 4 BIS Review 171/2010 
banks. Undoubtedly, interest rates would have been much higher. Moreover, since the interest rate by definition is the price one has to pay to bring future resources into the present, the borrowings and the increase in debt of this scale is not possible without a corresponding increase in interest rates. The continuation of these trends is fueling expectations of inflation and, resultantly, in interest rates remaining high. Thus, if anything, the criticism on SBP’s current monetary policy stance could be that it has not been tight enough. The reason for the SBP pursuing a relatively “loose” monetary policy is our concern that it would further crowd out the private sector and negatively impact the growth rate. Faced with this trade-off, SBP has been trying to strike a very difficult balance between such considerations. There is no denying that private sector has borne the brunt of required adjustment in the economy and government has considerably crowded out the private sector both through reduced availability and price of credit. Between June 2003 and June 2007 private sector credit cumulatively grew by 162 percent, while it increased by only 24 percent between June 2007 and November 2010. In turn, this has negatively affected the future productive capacity of the economy, making it more difficult to meet the relatively lower aggregate demand and bring inflation down. Another downside of the heavy presence of the government and its borrowings from the SBP has been the deterioration of the currency to deposit ratio of the banking system. During June 2007 and June 2003, currency in circulation grew by 70 percent and total deposits of the banking system, excluding government deposits, grew by 104 percent. In the following three years, currency in circulation increased by 82 percent while deposits increased by only 40 percent. While currency in circulation has a strong positive relationship with overall inflation, deposits represent the main funding source for the banking system. A decline in deposits tends to have a contractionary effect on market liquidity and puts an upward pressure on market interest rates. How did the economy cope with these aggregate demand pressures? During 2003 and 2007, the contribution of the private sector and the government sector were “balanced”. Nonetheless, aggregate demand pressures relative to the available productive capacity of the economy were substantial. This can be gauged by observing the cumulative growth of 2605 percent increase in the trade deficit. Which raises the obvious question of why inflation, interest rates, and even the exchange rate were relatively stable? The reason is because the economy was largely able to finance this demand from capital inflows from abroad, as can be seen in a growth of 1462 percent in foreign investments and 83 percent growth in Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking system. The situation looks totally different when we look at the period between June 2007 and November 2010. In response to growing demand pressures, SBP had started tightening its monetary policy stance and it did have an effect. Helped by a decline in international commodity prices, the trade deficit grew by only 18 percent during this period. And the reason SBP has continued with this stance is because foreign investments have contracted by 74 percent and NFA declined by 37 percent. In other words, while aggregate demand has declined but so has the ability of the economy to meet this demand and flow of resources from abroad to fill this gap. Had SBP not responded, the inflation outlook and reserve position of the country would have been worse. For instance, the growth in broad money and thus inflation would have been much higher if the private sector had also continued to borrow unchecked from the banking system along with the public sector. Some observer can comment that availability of cheap credit to the private sector would have added to the productive capacity, helping reduce the output gap. However, given the deterioration in the law and order conditions and energy sector problems in the last three years, it is highly unlikely that investments in the country, by both local and foreign investors, would have grown rapidly. In any case, rising inflation would have made the businesses uncompetitive by increasing the cost of production. BIS Review 171/2010 5 
6 BIS Review 171/2010 So, what have we learned about the dynamics of inflation in Pakistan? In broad terms, inflationary pressures have been a mix of upward adjustments in administrated prices, a persistence of output gap and inconsistent macroeconomic policies negatively influencing expectations of inflation. Monetary policy has played its part in correcting the macroeconomic imbalances, but other government policies have not been that supportive. The future strategy to control inflation must include coordinated and timely response to changing macroeconomic conditions along with a concerted effort to raise the productive capacity of the economy. Delays in implementing such a strategy would only make the policy trade-offs much more difficult resulting in continuing uncertainty regarding desirable economic outcomes. 
Ardian Fullani: Latest economic and financial developments in Albania  Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the press conference on the monetary policy decision-making of the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania, Tirana, 26 October 2010. *   *   * At today’s meeting of 26 October 2010, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania analyzed and approved the Monetary Policy Report for the third quarter of 2010.  After scrutinizing the latest economic and financial dynamics at home and the expected performance in the future, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania decided to keep the key interest rate unchanged at 5.00%. In what follows, I will elaborate upon the analysis and the main conclusions today’s decision-making of monetary policy was based on.  *** The performance of the Albanian economy during the third quarter of 2010 reinforced the main developments in the first half of the present year, featuring gradual recovery of aggregate demand, lower risk premiums and consolidation of macroeconomic stability. Broadly in line with our projections:   economic growth has accelerated (resurged) and its base seems to have broadened;  CPI inflation and expectations have been anchored close to the Bank of Albania’s target for inflation;  The external position of the Albanian economy has recovered and the exchange rate is more stable;  liquidity in the system has increased and the interest rates have generally been downward. These highlights reflect, inter alia, the macroeconomic policies pursued over the course of this period. Monetary and fiscal policies have, in a concerted manner, aimed at fuelling aggregate demand and economic growth, ensuring at the same time the preservation of macroeconomic balances. July’s state budget revision put emphasis on the measures required to be taken in view of maintaining medium and long-term fiscal sustainability, hence implying lower budget deficit and lesser impact of fiscal stimulus on aggregate demand in the short run. This revision paved the way for pursuing an easier monetary policy. The key interest rate lowered by 0.25 p.p., hence yielding the most stimulating monetary conditions during the last decade.  Nevertheless, complex challenges remain for the Albanian economy and the economic agents. Economic growth rate, albeit positive, seems insufficient to yield improvements in the labour market and to lower unemployment. In addition, the sustainability of economic growth remains frail in the short run. Its reliance on foreign demand and export growth may be insufficient against a background of a non-consolidated global economic outlook. The waning of fiscal stimulus also requires greater contribution of the private sector to economic growth, hence bringing consumer and business behaviour to the forefront and accentuating the role of bank credit to their financing. Setting proper equilibrium between BIS Review 170/2010 1 
short-term stimulus and long-term stability requires courage and diligence from the policy-makers.  Ongoing structural reforms remain a priority in the long run. The latter should aim at broadening the potential growth rate of Albania and underpinning its macroeconomic sustainability.  In what follows I will elaborate on these issues, beginning first with a brief overview of the recent developments in global economy.  The recovery of global economic activity persisted in the second quarter of 2010, while indirect or preliminary data show more moderate growth rates in the third quarter. Economic outlook remains highly uncertain due to the fiscal stimulus withdrawal and the private sector’s (unsatisfactory) soundness. Growth in advanced economies and in our main trading partners was moderate due to the correction of private sector’s balance sheets, weak lending and labour market, and low consumer confidence.  The low capacity utilization rate has yielded weak inflationary pressures at a global level. The financial markets continue to show high levels of volatility in response to the concerns over the economic outlook and the long-term sustainability of fiscal indicators.  In political terms, maintaining macroeconomic co-ordination at a global level and keeping open channels of the movement of goods, capital and technology, are considered priority measures to avoid a second recession. This would certainly provide substantial contribution to the Albanian economy, which remains a net borrower in the global market and that has benefited largely from the growth of demand and global trade in the form of higher exports in 2010. In light of these developments, and being largely affected by them, the Albanian economy has grown progressively over the year.  According to INSTAT, GDP grew by 3.3% y-o-y in the second quarter of 2010, considerably higher than 2.0% in the first quarter the same year. This growth was mainly driven by foreign demand, while domestic demand performed at more stable rates.  This performance was reflected in improved figures in industry, particularly in its export-related sub-branches. Construction and services did not perform alike:   The gradual recovery of domestic demand boosted further the activity in services.  By contrast, the construction sector continues to suffer from the weak demand in the real estate market, the limited financial resources and structural concerns related to its regulation. Subsequently, activity in the construction sector posted a high annual contraction rate in the second quarter, 28.9%.  Indirect economic and financial indicators suggest that economic growth performed similarly in the third quarter as well.  The weaker impact of the fiscal stimulus and the deeper trade deficit seem to have been offset by a better performance in tourism over this period.  The more positive economic outlook in the second quarter of 2010 was also reflected in the labour market. Although unemployment rate remained almost unchanged at 13.8%, the higher activity in industry and services increased employment by 1.8%. Nonetheless, the dynamics of these indicators is less promising than the pre-last quarter of 2008 period.  The analysis of economic activity by aggregate demand components allows for a more thorough assessment of the current and expected developments. (In the absence of direct data, it continues to be based on indirect quantitative and qualitative indicators.) 2 BIS Review 170/2010 
Available indicators suggest that the economy grew in the second quarter in response to the higher foreign demand. The performance of domestic demand attests to a more positive private consumption, higher private investment and a more positive contribution of the public sector, albeit more moderately than in the previous year. Except for a more pronounced waning of fiscal stimulus effect, these developments are considered to have persisted in the third quarter as well.  Although private consumption indicators are often contradictory, the overall setting shows a better performance compared to the first quarter of 2010. The rise in average wage and employment, the increase in the import of consumer goods and the substantial improvement of the consumer confidence index reinforce and signal the resurgence of consumption in the second and third quarter of 2010. On the other hand, the further decline of remittances and the contraction of consumer loans, the drop in the retail trade index and the higher consumers’ propensity to save suggest that the growth rates of consumption remain below the expectations.  Private investment recorded positive growth rates as evidenced by the increase of capacity utilization, higher import of capital goods and better performance of investment loans. The further increase of investment in economy is reciprocally related to banking system lending; but ultimately, it will depend on the performance of domestic and foreign demand for Albanian goods and services. The gradual increase of the capacity utilization rate in economy, as reported by business surveys, shows that there is more room at the current juncture for increasing private investment.  Fiscal policy has been more prudent in 2010 owing to the narrower room for fiscal expansion and the public debt approaching the threshold of 60% of GDP. Despite the public sector’s positive contribution to sustaining economic activity, the fiscal indicators point to its lesser impact on economic growth. The Government’s prudent approach in the first eight months of 2010 in view of meeting the planned deficit figure for 2010 actualized in the annual reduction of public expenditure and budget deficit. The latter amounts to ALL 23.2 billion, which is within the projected figure in the budget and about 51% lower than in 2009.  The 2010 state budget revision in July, which established the reduction of expenditure and budget deficit by 10% and 23%, respectively, is an expression of the fiscal authority’s firm commitment to safeguarding economic stability and ensuring fiscal sustainability in the long run.  The high growth rates of exports and the contained performance of imports yielded a positive contribution of foreign demand to economic growth in the second quarter of 2010. Foreign trade data on July and August attest to moderate annual growth rates of exports and positive annual growth rates of imports, hence leading to higher trade deficit in this period.  The growth of exports in 2010 was fuelled by the recovery of global economy and the favourable conjuncture of prices in the global markets, the depreciation of the exchange rate, the Albanian entrepreneurship efforts to expand the market and by some other factors of transitory nature.  Therefore, promoting exports in a stable and long-term fashion requires undertaking structural reforms, which will in turn enhance the competitiveness of the Albanian economy. This would ultimately serve to the transition to a more stable economic growth model and, at the same time, to curbing the reliance on foreign financial sources.  Our analysis of monetary indicators concludes that the growth of money in economy is concurrent with the economic agents’ demand for monetary assets, hence creating no room for inflationary pressures in the future.  BIS Review 170/2010 3 
4 BIS Review 170/2010 Aggregate M3’s average growth was 11.2% in July and August, being in line with the nominal economic growth and the enhanced confidence in the banking system.  Its growth during this period was mainly determined by the increase of the banking system’s net foreign assets. Private sector credit grew by 9.8% y-o-y, close to the previous quarter’s rate. Although the better liquidity figures and the improved banks’ balance sheets led to higher banking supply and provided greater room for lending, the latter has progressed at moderate rates.  Our analyses on lending in economy show that demand remains contracted and the number of worthy projects to lend is still low. The foregoing remains a constant concern for the Bank of Albania. To this purpose, alongside the banking system, we are considering the required measures that may lead to the growth of lending in line with the cyclical and structural needs of the economy.  Economic and monetary developments elaborated above yielded an environment of contained inflationary pressures. Average annual inflation marked 3.4% in the third quarter. Against a background of below-potential economic growth, and given the absence of monetary-related inflationary pressures, inflation was largely affected by the rise in administered prices. The contribution of the latter’s rise to headline inflation is 1 p.p.  In the absence of second-round effects, the effect of the rise in administered prices is expected to be transitory, while the inflationary pressures arising from domestic demand remain well contained.  On the other hand, the depreciation of the national currency has been declining, hence offsetting the rise of primary commodity prices in the world markets and the increase of inflation in Albania’s main trading partners.  The absence of inflationary pressures in the medium run and the contained fiscal policy provided room for pursuing a stimulating monetary policy that sustains economic activity. In July, the Supervisory Council of the Bank of Albania cut the key interest rate by 0.25 p.p. bringing it to the historical low of 5.00%.  In addition, the Bank of Albania continued to supply the banking system with the required liquidity in order to ensure the smooth operation of the money markets and to enhance financial intermediation in economy.  The favourable liquidity situation facilitated the rapid transmission of the key interest rate cut to the interbank and the primary market, hence allowing for the reflection of this cut in other interest rates in the economy as well.  The Bank of Albania considers that the inflationary pressures remain well contained all through the time frame of the monetary policy effect: the effect of supply-side factors is expected to be offset by the downward pressures arising from the performance of demand in economy.  The projections for inflation and inflationary expectations remain well-anchored around the Bank of Albania’s target. Therefore, the central bank considers that monetary conditions in economy are adequate to warrant the safeguard of price stability in the medium-run and to boost economic development further.  The Bank of Albania will, in response to actual and expected economic and monetary developments, continue to pursue a prudent monetary policy, thus providing the required monetary conditions for achieving the inflation target and safeguarding macroeconomic stability. 
Muhammad Al-Jasser: The need for national data compilation and dissemination Opening speech by His Excellency Dr Muhammad Al-Jasser, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), at the Special Data Dissemination Standard and Monetary Statistics workshop, Institute of Banking, Riyadh, 11 December 2010. *      *      * Dear Workshop Organizers and Participants, It is my pleasure to inaugurate such an important workshop at a time when many national data compiling agencies are confronted with ever increasing user demands and challenges. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to all the GCC organizations (central banks, ministries of finance, and statistics centers) participating in this event. Of course, I also extend my appreciation to the IMF for providing pivotal leadership in building capacity for producing official statistics in the region, and paving the way for adding new dimensions and quality to official statistics and thereby contributing to the global statistical system. Dear Participants, The need to compile and disseminate data in a systematic and professional way, especially with respect to the growing data needs, can hardly be overemphasized. For example, the recent global financial crisis has exposed the lack of data in key statistical areas that might have helped authorities better measure and understand the risks to the international financial system. Remedies to fill such data gaps (e.g., maturity mismatches) are critical for monitoring systemic risk originating from systemically important financial institutions. Similarly, the rapid transformation of the world economy has also brought new data needs for environmental and social welfare statistics. Data needs could originate from the necessity to cover new areas of measurement and use new methodologies to improve data quality, use and availability. They could also stem from the requirement to come up with new subject measures and variables.  Therefore, national data compiling agencies must be cognizant of such evolving data needs to remain relevant and useful. After all, it is the responsibility of the statistical community to make sure to address new data-related challenges which are driven by current and emerging user demands for official statistics. It is potentially in recognition of emerging data-related challenges that the IMF took several steps to enhance transparency and openness, and launched two key data dissemination standards in the 1990s. These included the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Let me briefly touch on these standards. The SDDS was established in 1996 to guide IMF member countries, interacting or set to interact with international capital markets, in the provision of their economic and financial data to the public. Countries that subscribe to the SDDS agree to follow good practices in four areas which include the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, public access to those data, data integrity, and data quality. Earlier this year, the IMF Board expanded the scope of the SDDS to include seven financial soundness indicators in order to make all stakeholders better understand cross-border linkages, and made it mandatory for participating nations to report international investment positions on a quarterly basis over a transition period of four years. Indeed, the SDDS is a global benchmark for disseminating macroeconomic data to the public. So far 64 countries have subscribed to the SDDS. BIS Review 170/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 170/2010 The GDDS, on the other hand, was launched in 1997 for member countries with less developed statistical systems. This system gives member countries a basic framework for a broader national statistical development strategy, addresses the full range of issues critical for compiling and disseminating data, and makes explicit plans for improvement to align national procedures with best practices. Until now, the number of participating countries in GDDS is 106. Both standards share several common features, and have successfully contributed to enhancing the range, quality, and timeliness of country data available to the public. They have also been instrumental in providing better information to underpin the operations of international financial markets and economic policy assessments in general, and thus facilitating public and private decision making. May countries that have participated in GDDS be able to eventually join the club of the SDDS. This is what Saudi Arabia has planned for. Dear Participants,  This 5-day workshop is to expand on many data-related issues and standards, including the ones that I have just talked about. Some of the important topics which would be covered over the next five days include: 1. IMF's key data dissemination initiatives 2. Essentials of SDDS and its subscription 3. Essentials of standardized report forms 4. Development details of statistical bulletin tables proposed by the GCC monetary union. This workshop will provide an opportunity for all GCC organizations in the statistical community to share national experiences, and lead discussions to identify areas for mutual cooperation for further improvement in data production and presentation. I may emphasize here that timely availability of reliable and mutually consistent national data would be of great help to the GCC Monetary Council in its task of preparing for the achievement of the ultimate goal of GCC Monetary Union. It will also provide the basis for judicious policy formulations even after the establishment of the Monetary Union for the region. I therefore urge you all, to actively engage in workshop discussions to fully understand these matters, come to useful conclusions and make your deliberations fruitful. Dear Participants I hope that by the end of the workshop you will have achieved at least the following two objectives: 1. Sufficient statistical insight to effectively address burgeoning data-related issues and concerns, and be in a position to produce intended statistical forms and table, and; 2. Identification of some future work based on mutual cooperation.  I thank you all for your attention and wish all a productive and rewarding workshop. 
Ivan Iskrov: Reflections on the past year Speech by Mr Ivan Iskrov, Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, to the Association of Banks in Bulgaria on the occasion of the Banker’s Day, Sofia, 6 December 2010. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It’s a great pleasure to be here this evening with you all, on 6th December, Saint Nicholas Day, and celebrate our professional holiday. Over the last eight years I and my colleagues from the BNB Governing Council, regardless of our numerous engagements, have not missed a single occasion to be with you and celebrate this great day. By this gesture we show our respect for and acknowledgement of the job well done by you in favour of the national economy. Commercial banks are not merely some of the many capitalist businesses focused on profit making for their shareholders. The banking system is a major part of the infrastructure of any market economy; it is its circulatory system. Without our daily committed work, our state would not be able to function properly. By tradition today we have the chance to pause and reflect on the past year and to share our hopes that in the year to come we would again successfully meet the new challenges. I have no doubts about that because we all have proved that we are capable of turning trials into useful experience, and experience into a means of completing the mission that society has assigned to us. The economic crisis, continuing into 2010, only confirmed these expectations of mine. Banks not only did not become the reason for deepening the problems in our economy, but they were also the main pillar of stability and driver for overcoming the problems. The Bulgarian banking system continued to be a paragon of stability and predictability in the face of the unprecedented slowdown in over a decade. As regards the blatantly provocative “projections” of some domestic and foreign “analysts”, just a few days ago I reminded you of their fantasies in a sort of a chart of “unfulfilled black predictions” about the Bulgarian banking system. The coming year 2011 is a year of elections. We at the Central Bank are well aware that it could be possible for some of the local candidates for glory – the eternal candidates to come back on the big political scene – to actively try and “sell fear” during the elections year 2011. So watch out! The situation is very complicated, and yet the banking sector stays flexible and efficient; while the number of non-performing loans is on the increase, the system goes on generating current profits. Despite the deteriorated quality of loan portfolios, Bulgarian banks did manage to keep considerable capital buffers, given the provisions of over BGN 4.5 billion allocated only by October. Is there any other country among the 27 EU member-states, apart from Bulgaria, that in these circumstances could be proud of the remarkable 18% capital adequacy and total liquidity ratio of nearly 22%? Once again I would like to point out that these outcomes are not accidental and do not come out of the blue. All that we have achieved so far is a result of both the long-standing and consistent efforts made by the Bulgarian National Bank for creating cushions and maintaining the stability of the system, and of the common sense and efforts of each and every one of you. Thank you very much for this! The crisis could not make us turn away from the strategic tasks facing us, i.e. to be competitive, to provide the services needed by individuals and businesses, to be innovative and stand in the lead among the EU member-states so as to meet the demands of the future. In one of the most rapidly developing areas – payment systems, Bulgaria marked a significant progress in 2010. The merger of the two most important operators BORICA and BANKSERVICE is accomplished. On 1 February, we launched into operation the national BIS Review 169/2010 1 
component of TARGET2 (TARGET2-BNB). The connection of the national banking community to TARGET2 is an important step in our integration into the euro area payment system, providing to the participating banks an opportunity to execute real-time euro-denominated transfers at an exceptionally low price. In parallel with launching TARGET2 and the developments in the large payments area, we had the system for processing customers’ payment in euro – BISERA7-EUR – started from 1 February. The system processes euro-denominated payments in line with SEPA standards. With the implementation of TARGET2 and BISERA7, banks and their customers have at their disposal a reliable and secure infrastructure for processing small and large payments in euro. This is a proper opportunity to invite any of you who, for one reason or another, have not yet availed of the advantages entailed in joining these two systems to do so. The most direct and broadest everyday contact of the general public with the banking system is through the banknote and coin related services provided to individuals and businesses. This year’s great event in this area was the commencement of operations of the BNB Cash Centre in Sofia. Our Cash Centre is one of the state-of-the-art facilities for storage and processing of banknotes and coins within the European System of Central Banks, meeting the highest requirements to security and convenience of the serviced banks and CIT companies. Through it the BNB has also met its obligations with regard to currency distribution and destruction of unfit currency. In its newly opened cash centre the BNB continues to provide to its customers standard currency-related services. However, this is the proper time to share with you that more and more often we receive at the BNB complaints by citizens that banks have refused to exchange damaged Bulgarian banknotes or that customers have received such banknotes in ATM cash withdrawal transactions. This necessitates the conclusion that banks do not strictly observe the BNB requirements to the quality of banknotes and coins. We expect from all the banks to pursue the necessary measures on their part for the full implementation of BNB Ordinance No. 18. The Cash Services Company is already operating full-scale providing high-quality cheap and very competitive services. Those of you who have not yet fully availed of them are definitely losing. As I believe any one of you will agree, the BNB’s supervisory policy can hardly be described as “regulatory comfort”, as our unjustified critics have recently tried to define it. The Bulgarian banking system is one of the most strictly and conservatively regulated ones within the whole European Union. The consistent anti-cyclical policy pursued by the BNB has initially stimulated the accumulation of capital resources and a liquidity potential for successfully facing the crisis, and later on (since 2008) has implemented a number of measures aimed at supporting liquidity and easing lending. In 2010, our supervision proceeded with the “fine tuning” of regulations and with the BNB’s very careful approach to processes underway in credit institutions. In the coming year, we will continue with the phased-in implementation of all new requirements and recommendations of the EU acquis and of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, taking into consideration the best practices. The adoption of a new ordinance on the principles of formation of remuneration in banks, which would recognize the risks taken by them, is forthcoming within days. Last but not least, on a day like this we should also speak up our concerns. The crisis, besides all else, evoked negative public attitudes in relation to banks. Although not a lev of Bulgarian taxpayers has been spent to bail out banks and it would be unfair to place the Bulgarian banks next to those that continue to receive capital support from many governments and central banks, we should be aware of such attitudes. A short list runs like this: “… banks are the ones to blame for the crisis; besides they do not show commitment to the problems of businesses during these hard times”; “… interest rates and taxes in Bulgaria are high”; “… banks enjoy regulatory comfort,” etc, etc. 2 BIS Review 169/2010 
BIS Review 169/2010 3 Have we got sufficient evidence to expect that such attitudes will dissipate any time soon? And what is our response? There is more than just one side to this problem, because the majority of the population lacks a basic financial knowledge. Others are not responsible enough in managing their own money. I agree with you when you feel indignation at the lack of objectivity in much of the criticism against commercial banks. But we can’t change people. The important thing is to do anything we possibly can to give our clients the maximum correctness. You could step in and play an important role by streamlining your business practices with regard to servicing clients. “He who works, makes mistakes” Mistakes however should be owned and rectified in a prompt manner. Our analyses show that in the vast majority of instances the signals and complaints received at the BNB theoretically could have been resolved then and there, at the branches and divisions of your banks, as these did not need to get as far as the head offices and executive directors of the institutions. I would like to emphasize that the BNB had stated its position about the relations between commercial banks and their customers long before this became a hot topic in the media. Allow me to conclude my speech in literally the same words, which I used to speak to you here exactly 4 years ago (back then, in 2006, banking was on the upswing and nobody was talking about crises or difficulties in repaying loans): “…it is in the interest of both consumers and the banking industry to establish between the two sides of the process long-term relations based on transparency of financial services pricing, and on the strict observance of obligations by both parties.” In conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the BNB Governing Council and on my own behalf, to congratulate everyone of you on the occasion of our professional holiday, the Banker’s Day – 6 of December! I wish you a successful 2011 year and much health to your families as well as to the balance sheets of the banks you are running! Happy Banker’s Day, dear colleagues! 
Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur: New Primary Dealer System for Ghana Opening address by Mr Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur, Governor of the Bank of Ghana, at the Stakeholders Workshop for New Primary Dealer System, organised by the Bank of Ghana and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP), Accra, 9 December 2010. *      *      * I am very happy to join you at this workshop which is the result of the collaborative effort of BoG and MoFEP to enhance further the financial market in Ghana. Efficient and effective financial intermediation is crucial in any country’s development and it is imperative that the necessary infrastructure is put in place. Beginning with this workshop, therefore, work on reforming the Primary Dealer System has started and you will be introduced to new guidelines that will control the system.  Primary Dealers are financial intermediaries who promote investment in issued securities. In the developed securities market a Primary Dealer is licensed only after a long period as a demonstrated participant. However, the Ghanaian wholesale market was started on a different note. In addition to a few licensed brokerage firms, all the Banks and Discount Houses existing at the time were made automatic primary distributors. It was envisaged that with their wide coverage, the Banks could promote the retail distribution of Government Securities. In March 1996, in consultation with dealers in the market, the Bank of Ghana stopped the retail market of Treasury Bills. It was envisaged at the inception of the wholesale auction that the primary market would be stimulated and broadened through increased competition for the evolution of a more efficient and dynamic secondary market. Despite the interventions, the market is yet to exhibit the dynamism that characterizes financial markets in the advanced economies. A number of weaknesses account for the inability of our Primary Dealer system to produce the desired objectives.  The proper functioning of a deregulated financial system and the implementation of indirect monetary controls require a substantially liquid inter-bank market for Government securities. The reasons this has not happened include: – lack of commitment of the Primary Dealers to undertake Government securities transactions as a line of business – the weak financial strength of licensed brokerage firms that do not have the required wide net work to reach the non-bank public – over 80% of Government securities are taken up and held by Banks. These are seen more as investments rather than as trading stock, and have therefore tended to hold stocks of securities to maturity – Government securities are seen by some Banks and other institutions as competing with their products that are offered by them to the same clients. A number of initiatives have been introduced in the market infrastructure to facilitate securities trading among Primary Dealers. These include: – the Central Securities Depository which provides custodial services to investors in Government Securities. This brought to an end the issuing of certificates for Government securities – the electronic bidding system for the auction of Government securities on the primary market which replaced the manual system for the submission of bids  BIS Review 169/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 169/2010 – the Ghana Inter-bank Settlement System (GIS) which has facilitated the settlement of Government securities. I wish to encourage you all to discuss the proposed Guidelines dispassionately and contribute positively to fashion out an efficient Primary Dealer system that a dynamic economy requires. Thank you for your coming and I wish you success in your discussions. 
K C Chakrabarty: Prospects for economic growth and the policy imperatives for India Address by Dr K C Chakrabarty, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India,  at the inaugural plenary of the National Conference on Leadership, at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)-Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence for Leadership, Kolkata, 10 December 2010. *      *      * The assistance provided by Dr M Saggar in preparation of this address is gratefully acknowledged.  Mr Harshvardhan Neotia, Chairman, CII-Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence for Leadership, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the organisers for inviting me to deliver this address on a theme which is both topical and of considerable relevance. My objective is to give a realistic assessment of the prospects of India’s economic growth, and the policy imperatives to achieve what is within our reach, while also ensuring that we do not fall off the cliff in an attempt to cross the valley. Our success will depend on grooming innovative and focussed leadership at every level of the society.  There are several successful business leaders in the audience and on the dais today at this “Second National Conference on Leadership”. The CII believes that in order to succeed in India’s mission to achieve sustained growth and competitiveness, the quality of leadership and human resource management plays a very significant role and is one of the key requirements for achieving business excellence. The CII-Suresh Neotia Centre of Excellence for Leadership is facilitating in a big way the growth objectives through the development of leadership and through these deliberations on what policy imperatives are necessary to grow at a rapid pace. I am sure the institute would soon turn into a premier institution of global fame to develop business leaders not just in India but for other emerging markets also.  My talk today would be in two parts. In the first, I would focus on (1) the upsurge in economic growth since the 1980s and further acceleration during 2003–04 to 2007–08, (2) the impact of the crisis and the V-shaped recovery that followed, (3) the near term growth prospects and challenges for India in a world facing multi-speed recovery and (4) long-term growth prospects for India. Part II would contend that in spite of growth success and remarkable near term growth prospects, growth sustainability in India would critically hinge on the following three things: (1) our ability to make the growth process more inclusive, (2) improved governance, and (3) developing leadership in all walk of life. There is some slack in all these aspects, as a result of which India is not harnessing its full long-term growth potential. However, opportunities exist for India to step up its high growth rate still higher.  I The transformation to the high growth phase  The high growth phase for the Indian economy started from 1980–81 when the economy clearly broke through what was known as the “Hindu Rate of Growth” of 3.5% that represented a low-level equilibrium trap for the Indian economy. Average real GDP growth rate for the Indian economy improved to 5.6% in the 1980s and was distinctly higher than the averages of 3.6% for the 1950s, 4.0% for the 1960s and 2.9% for the 1970s.  What caused this structural shift? In my view, four factors were particularly important. First, the high growth of 1980s was helped by industrial de-licensing and trade liberalization. There was a clear improvement in the growth rates of mining, registered manufacturing and electricity during this period. Second, high fiscal deficits fuelled faster growth, but fiscal deterioration spilled over to twin gaps and on the back of the Gulf crisis, precipitated the BIS Review 169/2010 1 
balance of payments crisis of the 1991. Gross fiscal deficit (GFD) averaged 6.7% of GDP in the 1980s, compared with just 3.8% in the 1970s. This also resulted in increased monetization of the deficit with net RBI credit to the Centre increasing to 2.1% of the GDP from just 1% in the 1970s thus impinging on the monetary policy efficacy. Third, the saving and investment rates in the economy picked up since the second half of 1970s, laying the foundation for the higher growth in the 1980s. Gross domestic saving rate had improved to 21.2% in 1978–79 from 15.7% in 1974–75, led by improvement in household’s financial rate that increased to 6% from 3% over the same period. Correspondingly, the gross investment rate improved to 21.3% from 16.5%. However, saving rate and investment rates stagnated in the 1980s till 1986–87, especially as public sector savings deteriorated after 1982–83. Fourth, structural transformation gathered pace during that decade, with services like trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, communications moving up to a 6% p.a. growth trajectory, real estate surpassing 7% growth and banking and insurance growing at an astounding 10.6%. As a result, in a clear break from the past, non-agricultural sector that was generally growing in 4–5.5% range, recorded a 7.1% growth in the latter half the 1980s.  The high growth phase that started in the 1980s has now lasted for three decades, with the pace of the 1980s being maintained in the 1990s before it accelerated further in the next decade. The average growth rate in the 1990s at 5.7% was statistically not different from that in the 1980s, but qualitatively it was better because efforts were made to reign in fiscal gaps. The GFD/GDP ratio averaged lower at 5.9% in the 1990s. The current account of the balance of payment also showed a remarkable improvement and the period was marked by India starting to reap the gains from globalization. Yet, the industrial growth disappointed during this period and averaged 5.7% in this period; lower than the 6.4% recorded in the preceding decade, as the mining, registered manufacturing and electricity growth decelerated. The growth in the 1990s was mainly driven by the services sector that grew at 7.1% p.a., with impressive activity in most services segments with the exception of storage.  Growth trajectory shifted still higher in the decade 2000–01 to 2009–10. Real GDP growth averaged 7.3% catapulting the Indian economy to the status of the second fastest growing economy amongst the G-20 members. Industrial growth recovered and averaged 6.8% during this decade. Registered manufacturing grew at 8.7%, though electricity decelerated. Services sector posted a growth of 8.0%, with communication sector stealing the show with an annual average growth of 25.3%, banking and insurance growing at 10.8%, construction at 9.2% and hotels and restaurants at 9.1%. High services growth has further changed the structure of the economy. Including construction, the services sector now accounting for almost 65% of the GDP, compared with just about 34% at the start of the planning era. The share of industry has about doubled to 20% from 11% over these six decades, while share of agriculture and allied activities has fallen to about 15% from 55%.  The impact of the crisis & the V-shaped recovery  For three years 2005–06 to 2007–08, the Indian economy grew at an astonishing pace of 9.5% before the global financial crisis caused a global downturn. It could not and did not leave India alone or decoupled. Notwithstanding the coupling and decoupling theorists, it was obvious that with India had substantially globalized. Its trade in goods and services accounted for 48% of its GDP and the economy substantially depended on large capital inflows to sustain its high growth the spillover from the global financial crisis was inevitable.  Inherent resilience arising from India’s large domestic demand, a stable financial system, high domestic saving rate, prudent monetary policy and fiscal improvement that followed the FRBM Act, 2003 along with the unprecedented counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies helped India cope with the global crisis better than most others. The economy decelerated over the next two years but still grew at 6.7% in 2008–09 and 7.4% in 2009–10. This was in spite the fact that that a cyclical correction in industrial growth had already begun at the start of 2008–09 even before the Lehman struck the financial markets.  2 BIS Review 169/2010 
Monetary policy reaction was nimble and sizeable during this period. The repo rate was lowered by 425 bps to 4.75% from 9%. The reverse repo rate was cut by 275 bps to 3.25% from 6%. The CRR was slashed by 400 bps to 5% from 9%. SLR was lowered to 24% from 25% for the first time in 11-years. Large liquidity was imparted through MSS unwinding, open market operations, standing facilities and some unconventional liquidity support measures. All this action was taken within a space of 7-months. The moves were coordinated with those in fiscal space that included large tax cuts and an expenditure stimulus. This portrayed a rare exemplary monetary-fiscal coordination that enabled the economy not only to limit the downturn, but also assay a V-shaped recovery.  Industrial growth bounced back since June 2009 and had moved back to a double-digit trajectory by August 2010. The recovery soon spilled over to the services sector, though the economy faced a newer shock from the monsoon failure. The resilience of the Indian economy was still evident as higher rural incomes and greater diversification in rural activity helped agriculture to record a positive 1.2% growth in a year of one of the severest droughts. On back of breezy industrial growth and resumed services sector buoyancy, the output gap had completely closed by Q4 of 2009–10, thus completing the V-shaped recovery.  The near term growth prospects and the challenges  India has now posted an 8.9% growth in each of the first two quarters of the current fiscal year. Purely on the statistical estimates of potential growth, this may appear to be the case of growth surpassing the potential. However, it is important to understand that the growth trajectory has been pushed high on a low base. With these favourable base effects waning away, it may in the short-run be difficult to step up growth without overheating the economy. The near term growth prospects remain very encouraging even if we see slight adjustment in growth numbers ahead arising from unfavourable base effects. We are beginning to see capacity pressures emerge in select industries. It is important to manage both demand and supply conditions and see investment response kick in while maintaining price stability.  Adjusted for base effects, at the moment the economy neither appears to be overheated, nor appear to face a slack. The inflation is above comfortable level but is trending down. The risks to growth remain on either side. On the one hand, the new spell of quantitative easing by some advanced economies has increased the uncertainty about future output and inflation gaps and is risking new short term asset price bubbles. On the other hand, the central banks in the advanced economies are trying to boost short term inflation expectations, but are risking un-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. We need to be watchful in this uncertain environment and if needed, take speedy corrective responses ahead. However, the direction of change and the relative weights in reaction function that it may be required ahead remains unclear at the moment. The level of capital flows in recent period has been in line with our absorptive capacity, but the potential volatility has to be borne in mind by policy-makers as well as private agents in planning their risk management. It is not without significance that in a world where global imbalances and currency battles have again come to fore, India has managed the impossible trinity without any significant interventions and capital controls. This in many ways reflects a new maturity level for the Indian economy that augurs well for its growth prospects.  The long-term growth prospects  India’s long-term growth prospects remain encouraging but with a larger uncertainty  band ahead. With capital stock growing at about 8–9% p.a, working force growing at about 1.9% p.a. and total factor productivity growth exceeding 3% p.a., India can grow at 8% or more. Conventional time series methods based on past data suggest a potential growth rate of 7.5–8% for the Indian economy. However, the issue is how India can move to a 10% growth trajectory ahead. We may think it is difficult to do so in the short-term but we must BIS Review 169/2010 3 
also realize that for the long-term sustenance of the society, we need to grow by 10% for the next 20 years. The issue is not whether we can or cannot, but what we all must collectively do to ensure that it happens. We also have to see that this growth is inclusive and job-oriented otherwise it will not be sustainable. Only then would we be able to meet the rising aspirations of the newer generation. We are at an ever greater risk of social cohesion collapsing should the growth fall from here. Herein lay the challenges for our leadership in various walks of life. Herein lay the policy imperatives that are needed to deliver this tough goal.  India has demographic dividends to support its growth ambitions. The share of working age population of 20–59 years may rise from 49% in 2000 to 55% in 2025 and stay still high at 53% by 2050. India’s old age dependency may be just 12% in 2025. This is in stark contrast to the ageing populations in many OECD countries, where dependency ratios are rising fast. In Japan the dependency ratio is set to rise from about 30% in 2005 to over 70% by 2050. Old age dependency ratios in EU countries are also rising fast. They are projected to go up from about 26% now to about 53% by 2050.  India’s growth story also has potential to benefit from rapid urbanization. The share of urban population in total is also rising rather rapidly. It was below 20% in 1971, but has climbed to 29% by 2001 and is projected to rise to 37% by 2016. However, both demographic dividends and the urbanization can be a great promise or a potential nightmare for the future depending upon what we do. For example, over 20 million Indians can potentially join workforce every year, but we are creating job opportunities at a rate of roughly 7 million annually over the last three decades of high growth. We need to step up our focus on how to reap the best from the demographic dividends and rapid urbanization. This would require increased resource allocation and resource generation in activities like education, health, urban and rural infrastructure. It would require efforts to bridge energy demand-supply gaps, new investments in renewable energy and stepping up mineral exploration. We need to do more to remove factors that might constraint future growth.  II What policy imperatives are needed to push the potential or macro-economically sustainable growth rate up? As I had mentioned, I would discuss three sets of policy imperatives.  Making growth process more inclusive  India has been a remarkable growth story for the last decade all right. However, the growth process has not been very inclusive. There are several indicators that would leave us uncomfortable with the current growth process. According to the United Nation’s Development Program (UNDP)’s Human Development Index (HDI), 2010, India was placed at a rank of 119 amongst 169 countries, which is clearly not in sync with India’s economic strength. Almost all our competing emerging market economies including Malaysia, Russia China, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam have better HDI rankings than us. India’s relative position has not improved very much over the years, with a rank of 77 amongst 95 countries in 1980 and a rank of 95 amongst 118 countries in 1990. This may not be surprising once we consider that we spend only less than 3.5% of GDP on education, ranking 117th amongst 142 countries and comparing poorly with countries like Lesotho and Cuba that spend 14% of their GDP on education and Botswana that spends 10%. We spend just 1% of our GDP on public health services and rank a dismal 181 amongst 188 countries ranked in terms of HDI indicators. Small countries like Kiribati and Marshall islands spend 14% of GDP on this and Cuba spends 9%. Most OECD countries spend 6–9% of their GDP on public health services.  Rapid growth has made a dent on poverty, but perhaps not enough. Over a quarter of our population still lives below the poverty line. Based on National Sample Survey (NSS)’s 61st 4 BIS Review 169/2010 
Round, the poverty ratio was 27.5% in 2004–05, with 28.3% in case of rural areas and 25.7% in case of urban areas. However, these ratios compare well with those in 1993–94 which were 36.0% at All-India level, 37.3% in case of rural areas and 36% in case of urban areas. 42% of India’s population earns less than US$1.25 per day on PPP basis. According to some estimates, more than half of country’s wealth is shared by only 10% of the population. However, India’s income Gini coefficient is 36.8%, which compares favourably than most emerging markets. As per the latest round of NSS, the unemployment rate in 2007–08 was 8% on the current daily activity status. India’s health and education statistics are disappointing even by the developing country status.  An inclusive growth process goes far behind income redistribution. It embraces a long-term growth framework with a view to ensure that segments of population do not get excluded from the growth dividends. The process goes far beyond poverty reduction strategy and to my mind is build on four pillars – (1) empowerment of the poor through provision of health, education and skill formation, (2) financial inclusion by improving the reach of institutional finance to the poor and (3) entitlement to food and nutrition and (4) asset creation, especially housing with water, electricity and sanitation so that poor gets shelter and is able to work therein or around and generate steady source of income to live a sustainable his livelihood.  I see financial inclusion holding the key to more inclusive growth. India’s remarkable growth story cannot be sustained in absence of rapid strides in financial inclusion. The targets under priority sector lending, the banks’ linkage to the Self Help Groups (SHGs), the introduction of Kissan Credit Cards (KCC), the regulatory nod to the Business Facilitators (BC)/ Business Correspondent (BC) model, the introduction of the no-frill accounts have been some of the several steps facilitated by the Reserve Bank to promote financial inclusion.  However, a lot more needs to be done. As many as 145 million households or about 43% of India’s population still do not have access to banking. Regional disparities further compound the problem. The Report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion (Chairman: Dr. C. Rangarajan) states that about 95% of the farmer households in the North-East do not have access to formal finance. At an All-India level 49% the farmer households are indebted, though the level of their indebtedness to the formal sources is less at 27%. About 10% of the population has life insurance coverage. Over 90% of the villages still do not have bank branches. Banks are today working with micro-finance institutions in many parts of the country in their quest to reach out to those who have been excluded. However, the challenge remains gigantic and would need to be provided by the mainstream lending institutions.  Capital formation in agriculture has started to pick up again, though the mainstream lending institutions could do more to support this process. The gross capital formation in agriculture and allied activities has increased to Rs1,38,597 crore in 2008–09 from Rs78,848 crore in constant (2004–05) prices. This is 76% increase that betters the 51% increase in case of all industries. However, we still have missing growth in relation to the potential that the agriculture sector holds. India’s yields compare poorly in relation to world standards. India’s yield of foodgrains has improved only marginally over last 10 years to 1798 kgs/hectare in 2009–10 from 1704 kgs/hectare in 1999–2000 and compares poorly with global average of 4168 kgs/ hectare. The yield of paddy in Egypt is as high as 9731 kgs/hectare and the yield of wheat in UK is 8281 kgs/hectare. While the yields have a lot to endowments, they are also a function of our technology, investments and institutional arrangements. Not all the yield gap is explained by different initial endowments. One needs a better understanding of the reasons why foodgrains yield in U.P is 56% of that of Punjab or in case of Bihar it is just 42%. In Maharashtra it is just 24% that of Punjab. Agri business leadership need to partner state interventions in stepping up productivity keeping in view regional conditions. Only then can we generate the supply response to push agricultural growth up.  BIS Review 169/2010 5 
Improved governance leading to better delivery model Over the last decade, growth theorists and development experts have realized that governance goes a long way in explaining growth. Good governance refers to good order and workable arrangements that cover a wide array of institutional arrangements including regulatory and legal framework which are a must to ensure a cost-effective delivery model for the entire range of products and services. In India, we have created many institutions in this direction over the last two decades. However, we do not still compare well in terms of governance indicators. In terms of the World Bank governance indicators developed by Kaufman, Kraay and Mastruzzi, India ranked at about 46th percentile in 2009 based on a range of indicators that are considered, implying that more than half of the 210 countries studied score better on governance. Our governance deficit can be reduced through faster decision-making and speedier implementation of all types of projects we engage in; be it safety nets, social infrastructure, road, other transportation or power or telecom projects.  Striking a fruitful public-private partnership holds the key to improved governance. On the one hand, the enabling environment for the business needs to improve further. On the other, the business leadership needs to focus more closely on investment project deliveries and bridge the wide chasm between planned investment and actual capital formation at the grass-root level. According to the World Bank database for 2009, it takes on an average 30 days to complete the procedures to legally start operating the business in India that puts it at a rank of 113 amongst 182 nations. In 29 countries it takes a week or less to start a business. New Zealand tops the chart as you can do so in just 1 day. In Australia it takes 2 days and in Singapore 3 days. Similarly, it takes in India 271 hours to prepare and pay taxes, ranking 114 amongst 182 nations. India scores even worse in bankruptcy resolution. On an average it takes 7 years in India to resolve insolvency through settlement of distressed assets through courts. On this score, India ranks 155 amongst 156 nations in the World Bank database, ahead only of Mauritania whereas in troubled Ireland it takes only 0.4 years and in 54 other countries it takes 2-years or less.  If each one of us, whether in public or private sector or as an individual works to capacity, the governance and delivery mechanisms would all improve. We have started to create marvel infrastructure, but it sometimes takes us more than a decade to complete an infrastructure project. There is no dearth of finance to fund infrastructure and experts from the infrastructure finance industry tells me that no commercially viable project that has the requisite clearances and the input availability is suffering because of lack of debt finance. There is no dearth of initiatives undertaken to step up infrastructure investments. The Viability Gap Funding (VGF), enhanced financing by infrastructure finance companies, takeout financing, model concession agreements, annuity based funding are few examples. What is required today is commitment for speedier implementation. We still have glaring gaps in infrastructure. We still have about 9% energy shortage. Large transmission and distribution losses, estimated at nearly 40% and absence of adequate competition impacts electricity industry. At least 7% output is lost due to electrical outages. As a result, India’s per capita electricity consumption at 542 kWh is only 4% that of United States and 1.5% that of Iceland. Our infrastructure deficit is reducing at a slow pace and we need to accelerate implementation of our plans. A lot may have been achieved in terms of the Golden Quadrilateral project and NHDP Phase III, but the road deficit remains large in terms of the ambitious but needed target of creating 20 kms of road every day.  Business leadership with integrity and vision can make a difference to our Governance. There are several areas where governance can be improved. This range from safety net delivery to corporate governance in our most dynamic of the businesses. We can easily push up our growth by at least 1-percentage point by improving governance. We can improve a lot other economic parameters including the fiscal deficit also. What we need to aim at delivery mechanisms to speed up project implementation in all walks of life.  6 BIS Review 169/2010 
Providing leadership  While economists recognised that governance matters for growth, they have had little recognition for the role of leadership in the same. Leadership issues were left to the management experts. Yet, to my mind, leadership plays a vital role in growth and development in a society. The right leadership can ensure a number of things that include inclusive growth, green growth, good governance, entrepreneurship, economic stability, peace, social cohesion. All of these ultimately act with force multipliers to deliver not just high growth, but economic transformation. What we need is good political leadership, corporate leadership, managerial leadership and social leadership. In all these walks we need leaders who can transform their workspace. Without leadership, we may grow at an inertial pace for some time but drift eventually.  Take the simple case of provision of education services. Our Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, has recognised the centrality of literacy in our growth and development strategy and asked how in this “knowledge century” a third of our people have remained illiterate. We also have the dubious distinction that a third of the illiterates across globe reside in India. There are enough leaders in this country inside and outside the corporate world who can join and own up national literacy as a mission, taking up the challenge of removing illiteracy through social responsibility.  The quintessential Bengali genius Amartya Sen has highlighted the lack of access to basic education as a prime cause for underdevelopment. In my view, it is pity that we could not still implement the Article 45 of our Constitution that required us to provide free and compulsory education till the age of 14 within the first 10 year of our becoming a Republic. This is in the land of Raja Rammohan Roy, Swami Vivekanand, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Sarvpalli Radhakrishna. Have we lost leadership now in our quest for greed, bonuses and bureaucratic power? Can we not have innovative solutions that provide a reasonable economic basis for providing basic education to all, while creating more institutions of excellence in different streams of education?  Presently, the country has over 300 million adult illiterates. The drop-out rates at primary and elementary education level are falling supported by the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and the Mid-Day Meal schemes, but still remain above 25% and 40%, respectively. Today almost all rural habitations are served with at least one primary school. However, over 40% of our primary schools still do not have toilets or boundary walls. The quality of education right from the primary to the higher education stage leaves lot to be desired. The business leadership needs to step in and the public policy needs to create a workable space for private sector to invest in education. Such investment needs to flow in not only in profitable IB schools, but in bridging the gap illiteracy and in technical and skill education.  If India was to truly emerge as the world’s leading knowledge economy, the business leadership needs to partner in technical education and skill development. If labour supply is augmented through vocational education and training, the biggest gainers would be business leaders themselves. Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) can no longer be the preserve of Governments. These need to come up in PPP mode. Of nearly 7 million or more that enter into workforce each year, ITIs are able to supply less than 10% of it. The total number of IT and BPO professional employed in India are rising by nearly 0.2 million per annum currently. We do not have enough supply of trainers. So the leadership needs to grapple with how best to create more IITs as well as more ITIs at the same time.  Business leadership should also look inwards. In an era, where the business leadership frequently looks to banks for debt restructuring, history throws up many examples when corporate leadership can innovatively work out solutions on its own. Take the case of the US airline industry. It has faced a roller-coaster ride over the last 90 years of its existence. At its inception, even though there was no threat from hijackers or terrorists, they found it difficult to sell tickets as people thought airplanes were inherently dangerous. Till 1978, the industry was also overregulated by government, but full deregulation that followed brought new BIS Review 169/2010 7 
8 BIS Review 169/2010 competitive pressures. I would urge you to read the book co-authored by Anthony J. Mayo and Nitin Nohria of Harvard Business School, and Mark Rennella, a former research associate titled “What the Airline Industry Can Teach Us about Leadership”. The authors write in the introduction of the book that, “Leaders are change agents who see opportunities and promise where others see only defeat.” At each stage of aviation’s business life cycle – start-up, growth, maturity, decline, rebirth – new types of leaders emerged. They may have represented different leadership archetypes as the industry went through its life-cycle stages, but they believed in themselves as winners, rather than falling into the trap of looking out for bailouts.  Friends, we have done reasonably well over the last decade or three. But we can do much better. So why not? It is in this context that I drew your attention to the need for a more inclusive growth, better governance and better leadership. We also need to focus more on higher investments in agriculture and rural infrastructure, education and skill development, better health services, scaling up infrastructure investments further by faster execution of projects and speedier delivery. These would work to take us to a 10% sustainable growth path, but we would need to look beyond the narrow business interests to so. An enabling environment through stable macro-economy and a vibrant financial system exists, but improved governance is a necessary condition. We have the elephants and we have tigers within us. We need the leadership that not only takes us higher on growth, but takes everybody along so that each one of us can partner in these efforts and share the fruits. Sharing these thoughts, I leave you all to deliberate further upon the various aspects of leadership and the policy imperatives necessary for future sustainable and inclusive double digit growth.  Thank you! 
Duvvuri Subbarao: Mint road milestones Talking points by Dr Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the inauguration of NEWSIBITION, Kolkata, 8 December 2010. *      *      * I am delighted to inaugurate this Newsibition of the Reserve Bank in this City of Joy.  Last year, the Reserve Bank celebrated our Platinum Jubilee. As part of the celebrations, we documented the 75 years of the Reserve Bank’s history in the form of a book – Mint Road Milestones. Milestones is rich treasure trove of archival material including, photographs, news clippings, documents along with a commentary which weaves them all together in an interesting narrative. In fact, the material that we collected was so interesting and rare that we thought it would be a great public service to put it up all in the form of an exhibition and make it accessible to a much wider audience.  But why are we setting up the exhibition in Kolkata? Because, Kolkata is where it all began. The Reserve Bank’s first central office was located here in this very building. It is thus appropriate that any effort to document the banks past and project its future be located here.  This exhibition is a part of the Bank’s outreach efforts to demystify the central bank. It seeks to introduce the viewer to the broad canvas, considerations and changing facets of thought that lay behind the Bank’s policy efforts over the years.  The display is divided into nine sections representing different phases in the Bank’s evolution. These take the viewer down 75 years of central banking history covering critical events and policies.  The Reserve Bank took birth here in Kolkata on April 1, 1935 as a private shareholders institution. It shifted to Mumbai shortly thereafter and was nationalized in 1949. Soon after independence, the bank repositioned itself to meet the aspirations of an infant democracy and dovetailed its functions to the demands of a poor country with ambitious development goals.  The 60s were a period of institution building where the Reserve Bank helped formalize systems for agricultural and industrial credit; catalyzed institutions such as the State Finance Corporations and helped set up the Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Unit Trust of India as the first mutual fund, the IDBI as an apex development bank , etc.  The 70s saw the nationalization of banks which heralded a new era when banking was taken from the classes to the masses. This was also the period when banks performed a critical role in poverty alleviation programmes of the government.  In the 80s, we started sowing the seeds of libralisation following the recommendations of the Sukhomoy Chakrabarty Committee. We focused on developing markets in a sequenced and calibrated manner.  Early in the 90s, we headed into a balance of payments crisis. The stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that followed marked an inflexion point in India’s economic and financial development. Banking sector reforms helped strengthen the banking system and made it more competitive.  The new millennieum brought with it a new momentum where India made a decisive break from the “Hindu rate” and shifted onto a higher growth trajectory. This was also the period when Basel II norms were adopted, the payments system was substantially revamped, and the focus shifted to issues of inclusion. India weathered the global financial crisis where the Reserve Banks’ policy response and role brought it into a new public focus.  BIS Review 168/2010 1 
2 BIS Review 168/2010 As we turn into the second decade of the new millennium, our endeavour is to position the RBI as a knowledge institution; conduct outreach efforts as well as a financial literacy and inclusion drive; and finally make efforts to document the bank’s history and traditions.  The 75 year journey of RBI gives us a glimpse of the spirit of the times and the Policy concerns of the age. We also have delightful anecdotes on “the note that never was”. This was a note signed by the first governor Osborne Smith. It was not issued ‘cos Edward VII’s heart had its reasons. The King’s abdication delayed the note issues of the Reserve Bank and the first RBI notes were signed by the second governor James Taylor.  The exhibition also chronicles anecdotes about the Reserve Bank’s brush with art (artists and philistines) and public prudery in the commissioning of the imposing statues of the Yaksha and Yakshini on the frontage of the Bank’s New Delhi office. These offended the sensibilities of many and evoking a host of parliamentary questions.  This exhibition tries to document events not only as they happened but also how they were viewed by the public at large through media reports. Earlier, the RBI Monetary Museum documented the history of money in India and served as the focal point of the Bank’s public education and outreach endeavours.  This is a concept exhibition. We hope to expand and refine it to showcase how the Reserve Bank contributed to economic policy formulation in the country over time.  As the Bank looks forward to the future, we trust that this exhibition would be the RBI’s mite to the cause of financial literacy in India. We trust it will evoke interest and take banking and finance not only to bankers and students of economics but also to the common person.
