Toshihiko Fukui: Semiannual report on currency and monetary control  Statement by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, before the Committee on Financial Affairs, House of Councillors, Tokyo, 21 February 2006. *      *      * Introduction The Bank of Japan submitted its Semiannual Report on Currency and Monetary Control for the first half of fiscal 2005 to the Diet in December 2005. I am pleased to have this opportunity to present an overall review of the Bank's conduct of monetary policy.  I. Developments in Japan's economy The growth of Japan's economy slowed temporarily from the second half of 2004 to the summer of 2005. Thereafter, it emerged from this pause and has continued to recover steadily. Exports and industrial production have continued to increase. Business fixed investment has continued to increase against the background of high corporate profits. In the household sector, household income has been rising moderately, as the number of employees has been increasing and wages have picked up. With this improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been steady.  Looking forward, exports are expected to continue rising against the background of the expansion of overseas economies. Domestic private demand is likely to continue increasing reflecting high corporate profits and the moderate rise in household income, while structural adjustment pressure, such as the excess debt of firms, has almost dissipated. Given that an environment in which a virtuous cycle can start operating has been established with the recovery both in domestic and external demand and in the corporate and the household sectors, the economy is likely to experience a relatively long period of growth, albeit at a moderate pace. Nevertheless, risk factors such as the continuing surge in crude oil prices and its possible effect on overseas economies should continue to be monitored closely. On the price front, the environment influencing prices has been improving. The output gap has been narrowing moderately, as the economy continues to recover at a pace above its potential. The decline in unit labor costs has been slowing with the increases in wages, despite continued downward pressure from the rise in productivity. Various survey results show that firms' and households' expectations regarding prices are gradually being revised upward.  As for price indexes, domestic corporate goods prices registered the largest increase on a year-on-year basis since March 1990, mainly reflecting the rise in international commodity prices and the depreciation of the yen in the second half of 2005, and are expected to continue increasing. The year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices (excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) had been slightly negative, but posted a slight increase for two consecutive months in November and December 2005. The year-on-year rate of change is likely to record a relatively clear increase in January 2006 and thereafter as the effects from the reduction in telephone charges dissipate. A positive trend is likely to be established thereafter, as the output gap continues improving gradually and downward pressures from unit labor costs decrease. On the financial front, the environment for corporate finance is becoming more accommodative on the whole. The issuing environment for CP and corporate bonds is favorable and the lending attitude of private banks is becoming more active. The decline in credit demand in the private sector is coming to a halt. Under these circumstances, the amount outstanding of CP and corporate bonds issued has been above the previous year's level and the year-on-year rate of increase in the amount outstanding of lending by private banks, after adjusting for the liquidation of loans and loan write-offs, has been accelerating since August 2005 when the year-on-year rate of change turned positive.  Land prices remain generally on a downtrend, but the pace of decline has been slowing recently and in some areas such as central Tokyo they have started to rise. BIS Review 23/2006 1 
II. Conduct of monetary policy The Bank has been providing ample liquidity based on the quantitative easing policy. At the Monetary Policy Meeting on February 8 and 9, 2006, the Policy Board decided to maintain the target range for the outstanding balance of current accounts held at the Bank at "around 30 to 35 trillion yen." The framework of the quantitative easing policy is based on two key elements. The first element is the Bank's provision of ample liquidity to the money market so that the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank substantially exceeds the amount of required reserves. The second is the Bank's commitment to maintain this ample provision of liquidity until the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) registers zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis. The effects of the quantitative easing policy have been changing with developments in economic activity and prices as well as the state of the financial system. When there were strong concerns over the stability of the financial system, the Bank's ample provision of liquidity, which met financial institutions' liquidity demand, stabilized financial markets and maintained accommodative financial conditions, and thus contributed to averting a contraction in economic activity.  In the current situation, the financial system in Japan has regained stability mainly because financial institutions have mostly resolved their nonperforming-loan problems, and as a result financial institutions' precautionary demand for liquidity has declined substantially. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has become slightly positive recently, and therefore the policy commitment has to a significant extent lost its influence on the formation of longer-term interest rates. Thus, the stimulative effects of the quantitative easing policy on economic activity and prices are coinciding with the effects of short-term interest rates being at practically zero percent.  The effects of monetary easing are being amplified by low interest rates maintained during the improvement in economic and price conditions. Given this situation, the Bank will thoroughly examine economic activity and prices, and decide a change of the policy framework appropriately according to the commitment based on the CPI.  Conclusion Japan's economy continues to recover steadily. The current economic expansion has lasted four years, since January 2002, based on the Cabinet Office's reference dates of business cycles. This already makes it the third-longest expansion phase in the post-World War II period. As for the outlook, the economy is likely to experience a relatively long period of growth, albeit at a moderate pace, and the Bank will continue its close monitoring of developments. The Bank will also continue to examine the state of the economy in each region thoroughly through such means as research conducted by its branches.  The Bank conducts monetary policy to realize sustainable growth of the economy through the pursuit of price stability. The Bank is determined to firmly support Japan's economy from the financial side to achieve sustainable growth with price stability by maintaining an accommodative financial environment, based on careful examination of developments in economic activity and prices.  2 BIS Review 23/2006 
Krzysztof Rybiński: Easier, faster and more economical! Things we have never done before Address by Mr Krzysztof Rybiński, Vice-President of the National Bank of Poland, at the Congress of e-Economy, Warsaw, 21 March 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, The first Congress of e-Economy in Poland is held in the period where the enormous progress in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT), accompanied by a decline in transport costs and reduced commercial barriers, has resulted in a radical acceleration of the globalization process. Some of us go even further and define the process straightforwardly as the third industrial revolution1, creating the vision of remote medical services such as, for instance, x-ray pictures taken in the United States and interpreted by a physician in India or Australia. New technologies go beyond borders and reach further than the human imagination. Nearly half a million of Americans have their tax returns completed by tax consultants in India2 the voice coming from the microphone in some McDonald’s drivethroughs belongs to a person sitting a few thousand miles away, table bookings in certain restaurants are also made in this way. This phenomenon, called outsourcing and offshoring, has radically increased labour efficiency, improved the quality of products and services, and reduced prices. Even consumer satisfaction surveys in the United States are often conducted by call centres located in India. The progress in the ICT is also one of the main factors explaining why the American economy has developed at a far faster rate than the economy of the euro area in the past ten years. The research results available3 show that labour efficiency in retail and wholesale trade in the United States has grown many times faster than in Europe, inter alia due to the use of the ICT in those sectors. The American Wal-Mart, the biggest global supermarket network, has implemented the new radio-frequency identification technology (RFID) for the purpose of further enhancement of the network performance and reduction in the logistics-related costs. So will have to do most of Wal-Mart’s suppliers. The above examples demonstrate the way that the progress in the e–economy facilitates global optimization of the manufacturing process, this contributing to a rapid growth in efficiency, improved quality, and reduced prices, and thus offering far-reaching benefits to consumers. It has turned out that although Poland is at the bitter end when it comes to readiness to implement the e-economy, the position of the Polish economy is high in most of the rankings concerning the investment or offshoring4 attractiveness, whereas our chief advantages include a favourable location, a large market, and well-qualified and relatively cheap workforce. Therefore, owing to the process of globalization of manufacturing and services, Poland may stand a chance of rapid growth, provided that our chief shortcomings, including the poor advancement in e-economy and e-administration, are remedied. We cannot afford inertia for other countries are quickly building modern e-economy.                                                       1  A.Blinder “Fear of Offshoring”, CEPS Working Paper No. 119, December 2005. 2  This and many other examples are available in “The Word is Flat, A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century” by Thomas Friedman published in 2005. 3  B. van Ark “Europe’s Productivity Gap: Catching Up or Getting Stuck?,” the article prepared for the International Symposium on Productivity, Competitiveness and Globalisation, Banque de France, Paris, November 4, 2005; R.McGuckin, M.Spiegelman, B. van Ark: The Retail Revolution - Can Europe Match U.S. Productivity Performance?,” The Conference Board, March 2005; and “Deepening the Lisbon Agenda, Studies on Productivity, Services, Technologies,” the report prepared by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Economy of Austria, published in January 2006. 4  For instance, the report by A.

BIS Review 23/2006 1 
In the new global economy, the public sector must be active and innovative, and it must support its citizens and business community. By way of illustration, the National Bank of Poland, as part of its statutory tasks and in cooperation with its partners in the financial sector, has created a modern payment infrastructure for large-amount (the SORBNET system operated by NBP) and retail (the ELIXIR system operated by the National Clearing House — KIR S.A.) payment systems, thus ensuring provision of safe and efficient services related to settlement of both types of zloty payments. The scope of services for the banking sector was expanded in 2005 to include two new types of payment systems for settlement of eurodenominated (domestic and cross-border) transactions, namely: the SORBNET-EURO system, processing mainly large-amount (interbank and customer) payments, and the EuroELIXIR system, which provides cheaper and more rapid settlement of retail payments in euro. The SORBNET-EURO system facilitates transfers of payments to the TARGET system, thus ensuring real-time processing of cross-border payments between banks in Poland and those in the EU Member States. Apart from Poland, only three EU Member States outside the euro area (i.e. Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain) have introduced similar changes to the domestic payment system and ensured a link to the pan-European infrastructure. No other new EU Member State has implemented such changes to-date.  The ELIXIR system, operated by KIR S.A., is one of the state-of-the-art payment systems in the European Union. It is marked by very frequent settlements (three settlement sessions a day at the National Bank of Poland), which ensures a brief settlement cycle and a closure thereof within a single working day. The exchange of payment orders between banks is effected only electronically. In addition to the ELIXIR system, KIR S.A. has recently  launched the EuroELIXIR system (in January 2006, 34 banks including the National Bank of Poland and nine out of ten largest Polish banks participated in the system), designed to settle euro-denominated transactions, both domestic (with no amount-related limitations) and cross-border ones (up to 12,500 euro and, as of January 1, 2006, up to 50,000 euro). In the case of cross-border transactions, this can be achieved due to the National Bank of Poland’s participation in the STEP 2 and EURO 1 systems. Despite a relatively high level of development of the Polish payment infrastructure, it is hardly used by individual consumers. Poland has witnessed a significant progress in the development of e-banking over the past few years; however, compared to other EU Member States and the neighbouring countries, our position is still weak, taking into account the number of customer bank accounts and the number of non-cash payments by payment cards. For instance, in terms of the number of transactions at POS terminals per one card issued in Poland, we rank extremely low vis-à-vis other EU Member States. In 2004 in Poland, approx. 11 transactions were executed using one payment card, whereas in the EU Member States, more than 35 transactions per one card were recorded. A detailed discussion of these issues and proposals of potential activities aimed at the spreading of non-cash payments will be delivered by Mr. Adam Tochmański, Director of the Payment System Department, in the second part of today’s session. There is no doubt, however, that a strong link exists between the development of the payment system and the e-economy. Efficient and modern payment infrastructure is required for settlement of transactions in the e-economy, whereas the volume of those transactions will grow only in the environment of rapidly developing e-economy and e-administration that support one another. I have mentioned previously the economic transformations related to the advancing globalization. It is crystal clear that administration does not remain indifferent to the globalization forces. Although the functions of administration have retained their objectives as defined in a traditional nation-state — creating the strategy and conducting the policy, establishing the law and regulations, and providing services to citizens — their scope has already changed. To give an example, determining the strategy and conducting the policy cannot take place without participation of specialists in a given field from outside the public sector, the law and conditions of operation must be aligned with the trends brought in by globalization, and the provision of public services must take into account the growing needs of citizens, efficiency maximization and the chances that the use of practices of the private sector gives. Hence, the abovementioned services are becoming more and more decentralized, based on public and private partnership, and privatized.  The development of information and communication technologies is another factor that has an impact on the functioning of the state. Firstly, it facilitates the switch from one-way communication channels to interactive two-way communication, which leads to, inter alia, greater activity of citizens and business community and better adjustment of services provided by the public sector to the needs of citizens. Secondly, the growth of the ICT sector contributes to increased innovation demonstrated by the public 2 BIS Review 23/2006 
sector worldwide, in other words, altered procedures employed by the public sector gradually cease to be of a reproductive nature, and the public sector becomes one of the leaders of innovation in the services sector. Consequently, the methods of functioning of the state and performance of its functions are irreversibly heading towards the use of technologies and assume the form of estrategy, e-policy, e-regulations and e-services. Therefore, we are facing the e-reality in which e-administration has its liabilities towards e-economy. In the past, the public sector used to follow the private sector and apply the best methods of organization management, customer relations maintenance and management or use of technologies, which all lead to increased efficiency of activities. In the contemporary global e-economy the public sector has a much more difficult and demanding role to play. First and foremost, this role consists in the creation of an environment in which citizens, business community and the entire economy may succeed on the global markets of products, services, labour, capital and knowledge. Efficient performance of this role calls for significant changes in the functioning of e-administration, as compared to the traditional public administration.  E-administration must creatively use technology to provide better services to citizens and business community, by offering them a wider choice (e.g. of ways of communicating with public offices) and options of customization of services, accompanied by mitigation of costs. E-administration must alter organization of its work and communication among public offices and public administration authorities. This can be achieved e.g. by taking over the burden of information management from customers (citizens and business community). Eadministration must set the directions of development of e-economy through creation of strategies, regulations and a system of incentives. The state, acting as a regulating body, can define the standards of operation by imposing on the citizens or a group of “better prepared” citizens the obligation to use electronic media of communication. In the United States and the Netherlands, for instance, large enterprises are obliged to submit e-tax returns.5 In France, on the other hand, the student and academic community have been viewed as an engine to launch the new standards. Therefore, applications for scientific grants are accepted solely in the electronic format.6  The imposition of obligations is one of the methods to popularize the interactive communication methods. However, its limited efficiency must be taken into account in situations where citizens are not ready or reluctant to change their habits. Research shows that even in countries on high positions in the rankings of access of individuals to the ICT, certain restraint is observed in the use of e-administration services offered to the citizens. In Denmark, for instance, it has been discovered that the reason for such restraint lies in the lack of common understanding of personal benefits that a user of e-administration services may enjoy.7 It points to a need for improvement of related education and information campaigns. Denmark is not an exception in this respect. Promotional campaigns encouraging the use of the electronic media of communication with the public administration are being developed in many countries; some countries have already launched such activities. In Singapore, a website has been launched to enable payments for almost every public office and government agency in the country, and its users participate in weekly and monthly prize draws.8 In Dubai another interesting solution has been employed, whereby a loyalty programme for users of online public services has been launched. Its first step includes a ten-hour training on the use of online services. The authorities anticipate to have trained 10,000 citizens and civil service employees by the end of 2006. Upon accomplishment of the training, the citizens are provided with a certificate and a loyalty card. Every time they use online services, they score points, which can be later exchanged for preferential rates in banks, airlines and other programme partners.9Online services available in various countries worldwide are highly diversified. They are all designed to best satisfy the needs of citizens and enterprises, and at the same time to enhance the operational                                                       5  ”Leadership In Customer Service: New Expectations, New Experiences”, The Government Executive Series, Accenture, 2005. 6  Ibidem. 7  “OECD Government Sudies.

efficiency of the administration and the public sector. Of the long and constantly supplemented list of online services offered, at least a few solutions are worth mentioning here. For instance, tax offices in Sweden and Estonia provide citizens with their annual tax amounts (calculated on the basis of all the information received during the year), to be confirmed via text message, over the phone (via IVR10) or online.11 The Finns, on the other hand, having changed their place of residence, do not have to visit the office personally, but simply log on to the website and enter the new data. For confirmation of authenticity, the certificate contained the mobile phone SIM card is used.12 Short Message Services are also used in the case of many other public services ― in the Philippines, crime victims are able to monitor the progress of investigation using text messages. In Singapore, citizens can order the service of SMS-reminders about dates of payment the road tax, return of books to the library or extension of the passport expiry date. They can also receive medical examination results using SMS.13The public sector faces a great challenge of provision of services aimed at the comfort of citizens (customers) rather than at the comfort of clerks, as it used to be for many years. It entails not only the necessity to change the way of communication with citizens, but it also forces public offices to adjust their internal processes and enhance their cooperation. As a consequence, projects such as “any door is good” are launched, whereby each office assumes the responsibility to provide an answer to a received query, even if the query goes beyond its authority. Another project entitled “one case — one contact point” is operated in many countries, under which registration of a new company is possible online, by filling all the necessary forms (for registration, tax, statistical etc. authorities) available on a website and authorizing them by means of the electronic signature. Integration of all the “back office” functions and processes has enabled Estonia to hold the world’s first online elections. In October 2005, more than 9000 Estonians cast their votes in e-elections.14Customer-oriented attitude has induced the public sector to open itself to the public and private partnership solutions. One of its manifestations in Singapore is the ability to apply for a passport at the photo-shop, immediately after the passport picture is taken.  Another significant factor, which stimulates the growth of both e-administration and e-economy, is the penetration of innovation and search for new applications for technologies in use between the private and public sectors. For instance, the abovementioned RFID technology was initially used to mark goods in transport and storage, as a technique more advanced than the bar code. China, which has implemented the RFID standard as a result of the efforts of Wal-Mart, the world-largest retailer, is currently considering its use in blood banks to track the location of blood batches. Another use of the RFID technology — also in the health care sector — is currently tested at the orthopaedic ward of the Singapore General Hospital. For the duration of hospitalization, the patient receives a band that facilitates tracing the patient’s location, whereas a built-in thermosensor measures the temperature without bothering the patient. Portable devices provide the nurses and physicians with an ongoing access to information on the patients. Moreover, there is a possibility to integrate the system with monitoring of the heart action and blood pressure15. A completely different, although slightly controversial, use of RFID has been found at the prosecutor’s office in Mexico, whereby a chip is implanted under skin of employees that have access to secret documents.16 It is a tool of both access authorization and control.  Taking a closer look at the development of public services in various parts of the world, one can get an impression that e-administration is well-present in everyday life, has been wellorganized, thoroughly analyzed, and in a conscious and consistent way improves the quality of public services in highly                                                       10  IVR – Interactive Voice Response – a phone technology that provides the user with an ability to contact a database over the phone with tone dialing function. Thus, the user can obtain requested information from the database or enter relevant data to the database. 11  “Leasership In Customer Service: New Expectations, New Experiences”, op. cit., Ain Järv presentation entitled “e-Economy and e-Government in Estonia” held on January 5, 2006 at the National Bank of Poland. 12  The system was launched in mid 2005 for the customers of the second biggest mobile telephony operator in Finland – Elis.

developed countries in Europe and North America, whereas in the developing countries of Asia, a higher growth momentum and courage in implementing innovative solutions can be observed. The progress made by the Asian countries is consistently manifested in the rankings, where, despite the use of various methodologies, at least two of the following countries — Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong-Kong, always rank among the world leaders. The table below sets forth a ranking of selected countries according to the index of readiness to implement e-administration17, developed by the UN.18              Poland ranks at the end of the fourth ten, far beyond Estonia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Mexico and Slovakia. Compared with other EU Member States, we rank extremely poor19 when it comes to                                                       17  The UN index of readiness to implement e-administration comprises the ability (readiness) and willingness (efforts) of the countries to: firstly, use e-administration solutions to ensure ICT-based development; secondly, use ICT to promote access to e-administration among citizens and expand their share in co-creation of the State, i.e. in the decision making process. Therefore, the index covers both evaluation of website development and access descriptions, e.g. the infrastructure or the ability to use it. The e-administration readiness index is composed of the three indices, namely the website index, the telecommunication infrastructure index and the human capital index. More information is available in “Global E-Government Readiness Report 2005. From Egovernment to E-Inclusion,” United Nations, 2005. 18  Ibidem. 19  The service evaluation methodology used in the research conducted by the European Commission consists in the creation of a five-grade scale used to define the level of services provided: LEVEL 0 — no website available to the public or inability to assign an existing website to any of the levels 1–4 (0%-24% on the chart); LEVEL 1 — INFORMATION — the information necessary to launch the use of a given public service is available online (25%-49% on the chart); LEVEL 2 — ONE-WAY INTERACTION — a website available to the public offers the ability to download a form that, after it has been completed on paper, can be used to launch the use of a given public service (50%-74% on the chart); LEVEL 3 — TWO-WAY INTERACTION — a website available to the public offers the ability to launch the use of a given public service by completing and sending an electronic form. Therefore, authorization of the person intending to use the service is necessary (75%-99% on the chart); LEVEL 4 — FULL ELECTRONIC CASE SETTLEMENT — a website available to the public offers an entire public service online, including the stage of decision-making and the delivery thereof. No other paper procedures are necessary (100% on the chart). More information is available in Online Availability of Public Services: How is Europe Progressing?.

our ability to effect settlements with tax offices (submit tax returns and effect payments), obtain a driving license or register a vehicle online. We have been assigned the last position among the EU Member States due to the lack of possibility to register a company online — we cannot even download the forms from the website. For a contrast, in seven EU Member States there is already a possibility to register a company online, without any additional paper-based procedures. The only area in which Poland meets all the criteria to catch up with the leaders, is the ability to submit customs declarations online. This service is available at top quality in a decisive majority of the EU Member States and only six countries provide it at a level lower than maximum.20It is worth noting that the purpose of e-administration expansion is not to rank high but to bring measurable and specific benefits to citizens, companies, the public administration itself and the entire economy. The research conducted by the European Commission shows that EU citizens save approx. seven million hours yearly given their ability to settle the income tax (submit tax returns or effect payments) online. If such a service were commonly available and exploited, the amount of time saved by EU citizens in connection with the income tax settlement could hit 100 million hours yearly. It has been estimated that each transaction online reduces the amount of time spent for its execution by more than an hour.21 We can imagine the scale of possible savings if we consider the data published by the United Arab Emirates, which read that 45,000 transactions monthly are executed online only in Dubai, whose population slightly exceeds one million.22The benefits of e-administration development can also be demonstrated in financial terms — it has been estimated that companies in the European Union save approx. 10 euro under VAT on each online transaction23, whereas the research conducted for Trade-Net in Singapore shows that time of issuing the commercial permits online, reduced to one minute, has enabled business people to save approx. 1bn US dollars.24The more revolutionary the services are, the more advanced the technology and the greater back office integration of databases are. Without going into technical details, it means that enhanced quality of public services coincides with the increased risk related to the protection of privacy and commercial information. There is no doubt that confidence of the society is a key element of e-administration development because it has a significant role in determining the demand of citizens and business community for e-administration services. Lapses and mistakes made in the past by administration authorities in various parts of the world prove that upon designing and implementation of e-administration solutions, the safety of data and information as well as the ability to ensure privacy must be among the issues of top priority. In some countries, they have actually been incorporated in the vision of e-administration development. So it is in Singapore, where the vision of e-administration development has been based on three basic areas and each of them contains elements related to safety, privacy and confidence.251. Networked Government as the basis for development. This administration network is to put into practice the motto: “Many offices, one administration.” It must also be effective, efficient, safe and adequate to the needs. 2. Delighted Customers as a manifestation of the focus on satisfying customers’ needs. Within this area, public e-services must be convenient and easy to use, they must go beyond the borders of organization and respect customers’ privacy. 3. Connected Citizens is an area that supports active attitudes demonstrated by the citizens. The area is best summarized by the following catchwords: Citizens as stakeholders, creation of communities and greater confidence and security.                                                       20  Ibidem. 21  Top of the Web.

A clear and publicly known vision is for sure a key element in the development of eadministration, as it demonstrates the will and engagement of the governing bodies, sets the destination and indicates the direction to reach it, and motivates all the citizens, business community and clerks to undertake amicable and creative activities.  Consequently, the following questions arise: • Do we have a vision of Poland in, for instance, 2015? • Does the public sector ask the citizens or business community whether they are satisfied with the level of services it provides? • Do we encourage the Poles to assist in making public services more efficient? • Do we have a system of financial and other incentives to encourage the public servants to assume relevant attitude so that the citizens and the companies are satisfied with the public services provided? • Do we use properly the joint potential and synergy of the private and public sectors including, in particular, the financial sector, to build an e-economy able to meet the requirements of the XXI century? • Are we ready to change the way we act and do the things we have never done before? If the response to most of the questions is “no”, it means that we must jointly undertake activities to reduce the distance between the e-economy of Poland and that of other countries. I hope the first Congress of e-Economy will inspire us to undertake such actions. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 23/2006 7 
Otmar Issing: The euro – a currency without a state Speech by Mr Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at an event organised by the Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 24 March 2006. *      *      * After more than seven years, the euro is firmly established as the currency of over 300 million people. Its internal stability is evidenced by the fact that inflation has been steadily low from the very start, despite a sequence of negative price shocks (in particular a continuous surge in oil prices). As an international currency, the euro is second only to the US dollar. At the same time, the euro represents a unique experience in history. On the one hand, it is based on a clear supranational monetary order, whereby the European Central Bank has full sovereignty in conducting a single monetary policy for the euro area. On the other hand, political union is still limited and sovereignty remains predominantly national in many policy areas. This asymmetry has raised questions about the sustainability of such an institutional arrangement since well before European Monetary Union started on 1 January 1999. The “no” from the French and Dutch people on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe triggered new interest in the prospects for Monetary Union and the future course of political union. This happened despite the fact that the text of the European Constitution does not imply any changes to the role of the ECB, nor does it significantly affect the allocation of responsibilities in most other policy areas.  The continuous challenge for Europe has been to find the right balance between political, economic and monetary integration. This has been called the “triangle” between the state (or States!), the market and the currency.  Economic integration took the lead In September 1946, Winston Churchill, in his memorable Zurich speech, called for the re-creation of the “European family”. This included the setting-up of a structure permitting Europe to live in peace, safety and freedom.  Although political integration proved to be over-ambitious, some visionary political leaders decided, nevertheless, to pursue the path of economic integration. This led to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and the establishment of the European Economic Community with the Treaty of Rome in 1957.  The first step was a customs union among the six founding countries. At the time, probably nobody could have guessed that economic integration would advance through various phases and over such a long period. But the Single European Act followed in 1986 and the “Single Market Programme” in 1992. In short, the Single Market is now becoming a reality. Work on the remaining imperfections of the Single Market is also advancing. We must not forget that this process has required many decades and continuous political support. Why, in the last 50 years, did economic integration face fewer obstacles and actually keep in motion the process of European integration? The main reason is that, from the outset, economic integration removed barriers and thereby secured material and economic benefits. In fact, it has brought widespread benefits by promoting reciprocal trade. Trade in fact has grown by several multiples. Economic integration has also helped to establish a more competitive environment.  We must also not forget that economic integration has rendered all EU countries more interdependent than in the past. Under these circumstances, spillovers from national policies could be significant. Each country has a stake in the well-being and, let me say, “good behaviour” of its partners.  Given such circumstances, the conviction underlying the Maastricht Treaty was that nominal exchange rates should be irrevocably fixed to achieve and maintain a truly unified single European market. Without a single currency, it was felt that the achievements and deepening of the Single Market could be endangered.  BIS Review 23/2006 1 
It was a political decision to launch European Economic and Monetary Union among a group of countries, which did not form a fully-fledged political union. Taking stock, we may ask: was this move appropriate and well founded from an economic standpoint?  For a moment, I want to go back to research on the economic arguments for – and against creating a monetary union. In the 1960s, a group of researchers – following the pioneering contributions of Mundell, Kenen and McKinnon started posing a crucial question: from a purely economic point of view, what is the optimal area for a single currency? The Optimum Currency Area (OCA) theory that ensued is well-known to you all and I don’t have to say much about it.  It is not easy to summarise the many views on the euro area as an OCA, or to sum up the vast volume of empirical studies of all OCA criteria for European countries. The euro area may not yet be an optimum currency area in all respects to the extent that, for example, the United States is. On the other hand, it scores quite highly under several OCA criteria – such as economic openness, diversification in production and consumption, degree of price stability, and several elements of financial integration. In the areas where it scores less well – such as price and wage flexibility, and some facets of financial integration – remedies are being sought.  How could EMU affect the optimality of the euro currency area over time? Andrew Rose and Jeffrey Frankel offered an important new forward-looking perspective strengthening the OCA argument in the euro area. By studying the effects of several currency unions that occurred in the past, they showed that monetary integration leads to a significant deepening of reciprocal trade. The implication for EMU is that the euro area may turn into an optimum currency area after the launch of monetary integration, even if it was not an OCA before.  In other words, to quote Rose and Frankel: “countries which join EMU, no matter what their motivation may be, may satisfy OCA properties ex-post even if they do not ex-ante!” This has been termed the “endogeneity of optimum currency area” effect. Several authors have brought forward concepts similar to the above hypothesis of the “endogeneity of OCA”, but in areas other than trade. Artis and Zhang have discussed the endogeneity of symmetry of shocks. Blanchard and Wolfers, and Saint Paul and Bentolila, have discussed the endogeneity of labour market institutions. Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen and Yosha discuss the effects of sharing a single currency on financial markets and insurance schemes. Therefore, there may be diverse sources of “endogeneities of OCA.”  Such endogeneities can be seen as a set of processes triggered by the start of a monetary union. Hence, monetary union may help to set in motion forces bringing countries closer together, forces that were not present (or strong enough) before.  To be fair, various other issues may arise in the years ahead that could render the verdict more complex. Some authors, such as Krugman in his “Lessons from Massachusetts”, postulate a “concentration” hypothesis: the euro, together with stronger trade and financial ties, will result in greater specialisation of euro area countries. This may gradually intensify inter-industry trade, and cause each country to become more sensitive to industry-specific shocks. In turn, more idiosyncratic business cycles would result.  Hence, if the forces of concentration prevail, euro area countries may witness more pronounced growth, employment and inflation differentials than in the past. This could be a concern in view of the generally limited price and wage flexibility, low labour mobility and the lack of a risk-sharing mechanism due to the still incipient financial integration. Time will judge the severity of this potential effect.  Montary Union  With the completion of the Single Market and European Monetary Union the economic and the monetary side of the “triangle” have been completed. This raises the fundamental question: Can monetary union work and survive without the third side of the triangle, which is without a fully-fledged political union? The answer is clear: yes, it can. It is possible that, over the very long term, strong elements of a political union may (need to) emerge, but for the time being Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) can proceed perfectly well without a political union in the form that we understand today. Here are the main arguments: 2 BIS Review 23/2006 
First, Monetary Union in itself has a clear political dimension. It entails the transfer of national monetary policy decision-making powers to a supranational entity, the European Central Bank. Relinquishing national sovereignty in such an important field is a substantive contribution to political integration. A central bank is, after all, an element of statehood. The Maastricht Treaty has made the ECB independent of any political influence so that it is able to fulfil its clear mandate of preserving price stability. Monetary policy-making is hence not only centralised but also depoliticised. This step was only possible because euro area members had achieved a high degree of convergence in monetary policy attitudes and preferences in the run-up to Monetary Union.  Moreover, the way participating countries see themselves and their role as nation states has changed profoundly. In this respect, the launch of the euro marks the most recent and far-reaching step. National sovereignty has not only been transferred in the area of monetary and exchange rate policies but also in other key policy areas, such as competition and trade. Finally, a single market has been established. As a result, the euro area countries already share important elements of state formation which are also key to the functioning of Monetary Union.  Flexibility Second, from a purely economic perspective, what else is needed to make the single monetary policy work? Most importantly, flexible markets are needed to enhance the ability of individual countries to respond to specific circumstances and economic shocks. Wages and prices in particular may need to adapt more quickly and strongly. The mobility of capital will become an increasingly important adjustment mechanism. In order for markets to be flexible and send the proper signals, policy-makers must ensure an institutional framework that sets the right incentives.  Substantial progress has been made but a lot still needs to be done. In particular, labour market reforms are still lagging in many countries. As a result, the ability of economies to adapt quickly and generate employment is still limited. The Lisbon agenda, the “pro-employment and growth blueprint” for Europe, sets the right priorities. However, it needs to be implemented more forcefully. This would go a long way towards creating the dynamic and flexible environment that Europe needs, not only for the proper functioning of Monetary Union but also for the attainment of the growth and employment objectives of the Lisbon agenda.  The Stability and Growth Pact Sound fiscal policies are another prerequisite for Monetary Union to work. As sovereignty over fiscal policies remains at the national level, the EU member countries decided to introduce fiscal rules to help to prevent imprudent fiscal policies and their adverse effects on inflation and expectations. These rules are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and operationalised in the Stability and Growth Pact. In setting deficit and debt targets (most notably the 3% deficit limit) and establishing procedures for budgetary surveillance and control, they are not fundamentally different from appropriate rules at the national level. Compliance with the rules in Member States will keep deficits low enough to ensure government solvency while providing governments with the necessary room to smoothen economic fluctuations through the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers. This will also generate an appropriate fiscal environment for monetary policy-making at the euro area level. The Growth and Stability Pact is a fundamental pillar of European Monetary Union. Past problems with its implementation cannot be denied, but the recent reform of the Pact aims to remedy this. In order to foster fiscal discipline, the governments of the Member States, together with the Commission, now need to implement the revised rules in a rigorous and consistent manner. The current excessive deficit procedures, and above all the case of Germany as not only the largest economy but also the “source” of the Pact are the real test. In this way, confidence in the credibility of the rules and in prudent fiscal policies can be reinforced. This will not be an easy task, admittedly, and serious concerns have been expressed. Sound fiscal policies will remain a priority for many years to come. The final stage What does all this imply for the future of Europe? Given the achievements of economic and political integration in Europe over the past 50 years, we should remain confident that we will also find answers to our current problems. Many problems have emerged and been mastered, although solutions BIS Review 23/2006 3 
typically take time and rarely come overnight. Does that mean that we can trust only in our past record of achievement? Obviously not. Current and future challenges will need to be addressed by the actions of current and future political leaders. We will no doubt see new challenges and ongoing discussion and debate about the most appropriate policies and approaches to consolidate and extend the success of EMU. However, to expect that such challenges and debates will threaten EMU is to underestimate the strength of European institutions, our willingness to make this project work and our ability to knock heads together when tough solutions are required.  On the final stage of the integration process, the steady state of political union in Europe, one can only speculate. None of the examples of history, be they a federation of states or a union of nations, can serve as a blueprint for shaping political union. The EU has always been, and will remain, a unique undertaking for which there are no models that can easily be adopted. It is important to allow an evolutionary process, which is open to further steps of integration, yet safeguards what is already in place and working well, and which assigns competencies to nation states or even regions as appropriate. In fact, we have been in the midst of such a process for quite some time, and Monetary Union is and will remain one of its major success stories. 4 BIS Review 23/2006 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: The International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance Governor's luncheon address by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the launching of The International Centre For Education In Islamic Finance (INCEIF), Kuala Lumpur,       23 March 2006. *      *      * It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you to this luncheon in conjunction with the Meeting of the 1440 Hijrah Vision Commission of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the Launch of the Vision Document that has taken place this morning for the transformation of the Islamic Development Bank to become the premier catalyst for greater shared prosperity and development among the ummah. We are most honoured today by the presence of Yang Amat Berhormat Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the IDB for the successful launch of the IDB 1440 Hijrah Vision. The Vision Document would serve as an important blue print for the transformation of the IDB into a dynamic Development Bank that will contribute to the "comprehensive human development", and thereby achieving prosperity for the ummah. We are also honoured today by the presence of His Excellency Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Chairman of the Commission, and His Excellency Dr. Ahmad Mohamed Ali, President of the Islamic Development Bank Group. Today, we are also taking the opportunity of this very auspicious occasion, with the grace of Allah, to lay the foundations for another initiative, the launch of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance, INCEIF.  The Islamic banking and financial services industry has experienced profound growth in this recent decade. This growth is expected to accelerate further global expansion in demand for Shariah-compliant financial products and services intensify. To sustain and support the future growth of the industry, an important prerequisite is the development of the talent and expertise that is needed to drive innovation and to raise the performance of the industry to greater heights.  The establishment of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) represents an investment in human capital to support the global development of the Islamic financial services industry. Human intellectual capital plays a pivotal role in driving the performance and market competitiveness of the industry. Going forward, it will be the defining factor. The fast pace of innovation in global financial services in general and in the Islamic financial services sector in particular, will demand new expertise and skills. Indeed, there will be an increase in demand for adequately qualified professionals. In this environment, the creation of a substantial pool of talent and expertise is thus indispensable for the future growth of Islamic finance. Strengthening research and development capabilities is also important for enhancing the capacity for innovation to meet the diverse requirements of the rapidly changing global economy.  The establishment of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance thus comes from the recognition of this need to invest in human capital to advance the industry forward to greater heights. Bank Negara Malaysia has allocated an endowment fund of RM500 million for this purpose. The income from the endowment fund will be utilised to finance the operations of INCEIF. The objective of INCEIF is to produce high-calibre practitioners and professionals in Islamic finance as well as specialists and researchers in the disciplines of Islamic finance. INCEIF will leverage on the wealth of experience of the Islamic finance industry, both in Malaysia and abroad, to provide its graduates with value added insights and perspectives, in particular for their research programmes. Malaysia's experience in Islamic finance for over more than two decades will also provide a training environment, including for internships for developing Islamic finance professionals.  The required skill set in Islamic finance is unique. It needs to have the right blend of knowledge of finance with the understanding of the Shariah as being central. The Shariah principles must be embedded in every operational aspect of the Islamic financial institution, including in the design of financial products and financing structures, financial contracts and their execution, liquidity and balance sheet management, risk management as well as asset and wealth management. The upholding of the Shariah principles must permeate from the highest level, including at the broad and senior management levels. Sound policies and practices premised on Shariah principles will evolve the Islamic financial system into a financial system that is distinctively ethical and that which promotes economic justice. BIS Review 22/2006 1 
In meeting this objective of providing a total talent management solution for the Islamic financial services industry, INCEIF will offer the world's first certification on Islamic finance, the Certified Islamic Finance Professional (CIFP) programme. The CIFP modules to be offered has been designed by renowned experts of their respective fields and have been developed in full consultation with local and international industry players in order to ensure their relevance to the requirements of the industry. Following the launch of the INCEIF today, the programme will be open for registration. Classes for the first enrolment will commence in June 2006. INCEIF also offers post-graduate programmes in Islamic finance that will include specialised Masters and Ph.D. programmes in the various Islamic finance disciplines.  INCEIF will be governed by the INCEIF Governing Council and the Professional Development Panel. The INCEIF Governing Council, comprising eminent local and international professors from the academia and industry practitioners, will set the strategic direction and provide visionary global insights on the learning needs of the Islamic financial services industry. The Professional Development Panel, with vast experience in the Islamic finance industry and academia well represent the authority in academic matters and will have the responsibility for establishing the academic policies of INCEIF as well as the quality assurance of the CIFP and post-graduate programme modules. The academic faculty will include permanent as well as regular visiting professors and scholars-in-residence. INCEIF will also form strategic alliances with leading local and international learning institutions to complement our pursuit to provide world-class knowledge for the benefit of the industry in particular, and the ummah in general. It is our vision that INCEIF will one day be an international nucleus for tertiary education in Islamic finance, training and research and provide a strong support in the development of Islamic financial infrastructure. With the grace of Allah, and with the support of the international Islamic financial community, it is our hope that INCEIF will make a meaningful contribution to the future development of Islamic finance for the benefit of the ummah.  In closing, once again, I would like to express our deepest appreciation to the Yang Amat Berhormat, Dato' Seri Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi, Prime Minister of Malaysia for gracing this occasion and for accepting to officiate the launch of INCEIF. 2 BIS Review 22/2006 
Jarle Bergo: The role of interest rates and the outlook for the Norwegian economy Address by Mr Jarle Bergo, Deputy Governor of Norges Bank, at a seminar hosted by Swedbank Markets Oslo/First Securities, Gardermoen, 23 March 2006. The  charts can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. The address is based on the assessments presented at Norges Bank’s press conference following the Executive Board’s monetary policy meeting on 16 March, Inflation Report 1/06 and on previous speeches. *      *      * The interest rate is a variable that affects most of us, whether we are investors or borrowers. And even if we don’t have debts or assets, the influence of the interest rate on the economy will affect us indirectly. In this presentation, I would like first to discuss briefly the various roles played by the interest rate in a theoretical framework and as an instrument in monetary policy. With this as background, I will go on to present Norges Bank’s view of the Norwegian economy and our monetary policy assessment, which was published in the Inflation Report on 16 March.  The interest rate has several functions Interest rates are the terms at which money or goods today may be traded off for money or goods at a future date - the price we pay to bring consumption forward in time and the compensation we receive for postponing consumption. The interest rate is also the price of money – the price we pay in order to have liquid holdings and the compensation we receive for storing our savings in less liquid forms. The interest rate is also used as an instrument in economic policy. Setting the interest rate to achieve a monetary policy objective, often price stability or low and stable inflation, is usually the responsibility of the central bank. This is also the case in Norway.  Low and stable inflation provides the economy with a nominal anchor, and is the most important contribution monetary policy can make to sound economic developments in the long term. This contributes to increased predictability for those who take decisions about saving and investment today, although the result of those decisions also depends on how the economy develops in the future.  In its conduct of monetary policy, Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that weight is given to both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment. Flexible inflation targeting builds a bridge between the long-term objective of monetary policy, which is to keep inflation on target and provide an anchor for inflation expectations, and the more short-term objective of stability in the real economy.  Monetary policy influences the economy with long and variable lags. Norges Bank sets the interest rate with a view to stabilising inflation at the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1–3 years. The relevant horizon will depend on disturbances to which the economy is exposed and how they will affect the path for inflation and the real economy in the period ahead.  The primary instrument in monetary policy is Norges Bank’s sight deposit rate. This rate determines the very short interest rates in the money market with maturities from one day upwards, normally up to Norges Bank’s next monetary policy meeting. Longer-term rates are determined by expectations concerning Norges Bank’s use of instruments in the future and by the degree of confidence in monetary policy.  It may be useful to distinguish between three channels through which the real interest rate influences inflation:  The demand channel: As interest rates increase, household and municipal consumption and investment will tend to slow down. This is because they have less money left over after servicing their debt and because borrowing is more expensive. Corporate finances are weakened and investment may become less attractive. Lower demand leads to lower output and employment. Wage growth may BIS Review 22/2006 1 
slow down. Lower wage growth combined with reduced profit margins will result in decreasing inflation.  The exchange rate channel: The effect of interest rate changes may be amplified because the interest rate also affects the krone exchange rate. When interest rates are higher, more people will invest and fewer will borrow in NOK. Higher interest rates will thus normally lead to an appreciation of the krone. Imported goods will then become less expensive and inflation will decelerate. A stronger krone also dampens exports and reduces profitability in Norwegian business and industry. The effect on the exchange rate of a change in interest rates will vary as themes and sentiments shift in the foreign exchange market.  The expectations channel: We believe that expectations play an important role when prices and wages are set. Expectations concerning future inflation and economic stability have considerable impact, not least in the foreign exchange market. Inflation expectations also influence wage demands and have an effect when companies adjust their prices. It is difficult to be precise about how expectations are formed. Confidence in the inflation target may provide an anchor. Past inflation rates may also influence what we think inflation will be in the future. There is thus an interaction between inflation expectations and inflation. If there is confidence in monetary policy, expected inflation in the medium term will be close to the inflation target. This contributes to stabilising inflation around the target. It is thus important for the central bank to ensure that households, companies, the social partners and financial market participants are confident that inflation will remain low and stable.  Let me introduce the concepts of the “neutral rate” and the “long-term equilibrium rate”. Both should be seen as real rates, that is nominal interest rates adjusted for expected inflation. The neutral real interest rate is defined as the rate that does not in itself result in an increase or a reduction in price and cost inflation in the economy in the course of a business cycle. An assessment of whether interest rate setting is expansionary or contractionary involves comparing actual short-term market rates with the neutral rate. I will revert to the quantification of the neutral rate later. The interest rate influences savings and investment. In the longer term, the real interest rate level determines capital accumulation in the economy and the potential for economic growth. The long term equilibrium real interest rate is the rate that ensures that capital accumulation corresponds to the saving decisions in the economy. This rate results in a path for potential output that satisfies the preferences for distributing demand over time without generating pressures or slumps in the economy.  The equilibrium rate is determined by long-term phenomena associated with the structure of the economy, like consumer impatience, population growth and technological progress. The neutral rate is defined on the basis of its impact on capacity utilisation and inflationary pressures in the economy. In the long term, the neutral interest rate should correspond to the long-term equilibrium interest rate in the economy. There will also be limits as to how much the long-term equilibrium interest rate can deviate between countries over time in a world of liberalised capital markets.  The interest rate therefore has several roles to play in the economy and these roles are fairly closely linked. The interest rate shall in the short and medium term contribute to stable inflation and stable developments in production. This will require active use of the interest rate as a policy instrument. But the interest rate should also contribute to equilibrium in the market for real capital in the long run. To achieve this, the real interest rate must not over time deviate too much from the return on real capital. Substantial deviations can give rise to undesirable fluctuations in the markets for real capital that have no basis in economic fundamentals.  In Norway, both short- and long-term real interest rates are at the moment at a low level, compared to the past few decades. This is also the case in many other countries. How large the deviations from the neutral and the equilibrium rates are, on the other hand, is less clear. Neither the neutral rate nor the equilibrium rate are variables that can be observed. Economic theory can contribute insight into the factors that determine the equilibrium rate, but attempts to quantify it based on theory yield an uncomfortably broad interval. An alternative is to use historical average interest rates on the basis of an assumption that actual real interest rates will vary around the equilibrium rate. This method also poses problems, however.  2 BIS Review 22/2006 
Throughout the period 1870-2005, the average long-term real interest rate in Norway has remained close to the average in the UK and the US: Norway 2.2 per cent, the UK 2.0 per cent and the US 2.8 per cent. In all countries, fluctuations in real interest rates have been substantial in periods. The real interest rate has fallen markedly since the beginning of the 1990s. There is an ongoing debate about the reasons for the decline in long-term real interest rates over the last few years. I will not elaborate on that debate here; it is a subject worthy of a seminar by itself. One particular possibility, pertaining to the discussion of the roles of the real interest rate, is that the fall in long-term interest rates may partly reflect market participants’ assessment that the neutral real interest rate has fallen. During a business cycle, it is the real interest rate’s deviation from the neutral real interest rate – the real interest rate gap – that indicates whether monetary policy is expansionary or contractionary.  The neutral real interest rate is difficult to estimate and may change over time. Nevertheless, we have tried. On an uncertain basis we estimate that the neutral real interest rate for Norway may now be close to 2½ per cent, having come down approximately 1½ percentage points since the mid-1990s. Forecasts in the latest Inflation Report indicate that the short term real interest rate in Norway will be close to its neutral level in about four years. According to this, the real interest rate gap (the difference between the neutral rate and the actual rate) has been negative since 2004. There is evidence that monetary policy has had the desired impact both on the real economy and on inflation.  Monetary policy at the present phase of the cycle Growth in the Norwegian economy has been high since summer 2003. The expansion has gradually broadened. Low interest rates have contributed to a relatively sharp rise in household demand throughout the upturn. At the same time, solid global growth has led to increased demand for many Norwegian export goods and high prices. Fixed investment in the petroleum sector has increased sharply, resulting in growing demand for goods and services supplied by mainland enterprises. Mainland fixed investment has also picked up gradually. So far in the economic upturn, the mainland economy has grown by an average of about 3.5 per cent quarterly, measured as an annualised rate.  The output gap is a measure that expresses our assessment of total capacity utilisation in the economy. The output gap is defined as the percentage difference between actual output and potential output. Potential output indicates the level of output that is consistent with price and cost stability. The estimate for the output gap is uncertain partly because the level of potential output is unobservable. Since official statistics on overall activity in the economy are not available immediately and are subsequently revised, the level of actual output will be uncertain. In assessing the size of the output gap, technical calculations are compared with other information about capacity utilisation in the economy. As more information has come to light, the output gap has been revised downwards for 2005, but at the same time the growth rate towards the end of the year is estimated to be higher. Output has increased more rapidly than potential output for 2-3 years. Much of the available capacity has now been put to use. We now estimate that capacity utilisation was approximately ½ per cent above normal at end-2005.  Despite strong economic growth, inflation is still low. As the recovery became more broadly based, inflation gradually began to edge higher. In the second half of 2005, the 12-month rise in consumer prices adjusted for tax changes and excluding energy products (CPI-ATE) varied between 1 and 1½ per cent, before surprising on the downside in December and January. In February, inflation edged up again. Monthly variations in the CPI-ATE have been fairly pronounced recently.  There is little prospect that inflation will increase substantially in the near term. If we adjust for the effect of reduced maximum day-care rates, the year-on-year rise in the CPI-ATE is projected to be 1¼ per cent in the second quarter of 2006. Inflation will be dampened by continued low external price impulses and the appreciation of the krone through 2004 and 2005. After a period, the unwinding of the sharp rise in petrol prices through 2005 will probably lead to some decline in the year-on-year rise in the CPI.  Growth among our trading partners is still solid, and appears on the whole to be somewhat stronger than assumed a few months ago. High commodity prices have contributed to somewhat higher BIS Review 22/2006 3 
inflation, but so far underlying inflation has not been pushed up. Key rates have been raised in a number of countries, and market participants expect further interest rate increases.  Key rates remain low among many of our trading partners. Market participants expect a gradual increase in key rates in the period ahead, both in Sweden and the euro area. In the US, the key rate is expected to increase by a further 50 basis points before peaking. In the UK, the key rate is expected to remain virtually unchanged in the period ahead.  Long-term interest rates are also low in most other countries.  Oil prices have risen markedly over the last couple of years. Growth in global oil demand is expected to approach 2 per cent in 2006. This is in line with expected growth in supply from non-OPEC countries. On the whole, this supports the view that the price of oil will remain high. Futures prices indicate that the price of oil may remain above USD 60 per barrel for the next few years. High growth in the global economy also contributed to a further rise in prices for other commodities. This increase has continued in 2006. In spite of a slight decline recently, metal prices have increased substantially in recent months. There has also been a pronounced increase in futures prices, indicating expectations of a sustained upward movement in metal prices similar to that of oil prices. High commodity prices have contributed to somewhat higher head-line inflation, but so far underlying inflation has not risen.  Rising commodity prices and buoyant activity in markets that are important for Norway have fuelled growth in the Norwegian economy.  We assume that the upturn will continue for our trading partners as a whole. Growth is projected to be somewhat stronger in 2006 than in 2005. Nevertheless, there will still be idle resources, especially in a number of European countries, implying continued low inflation.  In recent years, investment in the petroleum sector has increased sharply. Investment growth has generated substantial impulses to the mainland economy. The large development projects relating to Snøhvit outside of Hammerfest and Ormen Lange at Aukra have made a large contribution to the high level of investment. Both these projects also involve considerable onshore development, which may have generated stronger impulses to the business sector locally than pure offshore projects. Investment activity associated with Snøhvit and Ormen Lange will probably decline in the period to completion in 2007. High oil prices have led to a strong increase in activity on the Norwegian continental shelf. Many projects have been launched to increase recovery from fields in operation. A number of oil companies have revised upwards the long-term oil prices that are used as a basis for investment decisions, although they are still moderate compared with futures prices.  Further out in the projection period, developments in petroleum-related investment are highly uncertain. It is assumed that overall activity will decline somewhat when Snøhvit and Ormen Lange are completed, but that the high oil price will contribute to maintaining investment at a relatively high level throughout the projection period.  The fiscal rule implies a gradual phasing-in of petroleum revenues into the economy, approximately in pace with the expected real return on the Government Pension Fund – Global, formerly known as the Petroleum Fund. The Government Pension Fund – Global is likely to expand sharply in the years ahead. On the basis of our assumptions for developments in oil prices ahead (oil futures prices), a mechanical application of the 4 per cent rule implies that the use of petroleum revenues will increase by more than NOK 31 billion from 2006 to 2009. This is somewhat higher than expected in the Government’s supplement to the budget for 2006. The difference can partly be explained by the fact that at end-2005 the Fund’s capital was higher than that estimated by the Government, and partly that the Government assumed that oil prices ahead would be lower than current oil futures. For 2007, we assume an approximately unchanged structural non-oil deficit.  With continued solid growth in the Norwegian economy, it would be in line with the fiscal rule if the use of petroleum revenues is lower than the expected real return on the Government Pension Fund – Global over a few years. Our projections are based on the assumption that fiscal policy will provide some stimulus to aggregate demand and output in 2008 and 2009, but somewhat less than a mechanical application of the fiscal rule based on our oil price assumption would imply.  4 BIS Review 22/2006 
Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime and seeks to achieve an interest rate path that provides a reasonable balance between the objective of bringing inflation up towards 2.5 per cent over time and stabilising developments in output and employment.  Norge Bank’s projections in the baseline scenario is based on an interest rate path that we find strikes a reasonable balance between the two objectives. In the baseline scenario, interest rates in Norway and abroad are assumed to rise somewhat faster in the longer term than current forward rates may imply. Exchange rate movements are difficult to project. The interest rate path at home and abroad may be consistent with an approximately unchanged krone exchange rate.  The high growth rate in the economy implies a gradual pick-up in price and cost inflation. With interest rate developments as outlined above, CPI-ATE inflation is projected to increase from about 1¼ per cent today to about 2 per cent at the end of 2007. There are prospects of a further increase in inflation, with inflation projected to be close to the target of 2.5 per cent three years ahead. According to our estimates, capacity utilisation is now slightly higher than its normal level. Mainland GDP is projected to show sustained strong growth in 2006. The output gap is expected to increase over the next two years, but will peak at a fairly moderate level as gradual increases in the interest rate dampen demand growth. Growth in the global economy is projected to remain high, resulting in both high demand and favourable prices for the Norwegian export sector. There are prospects that high petroleum investment will contribute to sustaining the high level of activity in the Norwegian economy. In 2008 and 2009, a continued high level of petroleum revenues may imply an expansionary fiscal policy. Interest-rate setting since last summer has been oriented towards a gradual increase in the interest rate – in small, not too frequent steps – towards a more normal level. Based on Norges Bank’s assessment of the driving forces in the economy, this strategy appears robust. Output growth is strong and the labour market is becoming tighter more quickly than expected. Higher growth in the economy may in isolation suggest a faster increase in the interest rate ahead. This would reduce the risk of bottlenecks in the economy, with rising cost inflation and continued debt build-up. On the other hand, the objective of bringing inflation up towards the target and anchoring inflation expectations argues for restraint in the upward movement of interest rates.  On balance, this implies that the interest rate outlook remains virtually unchanged compared with the previous Report. Thus our current assessment indicates an interest rate path where the interest rate is raised by about 1 percentage point this year, in line with expectations in the market.  The two previous Inflation Reports underlined the risk that a low interest rate over a long period may result in strong pressures in the economy, with a risk of bottlenecks, accelerating cost inflation and debt accumulation. On the other hand, the Reports also pointed to the risk that continued trade shifts and increased competition in labour and product markets might result in lower price and wage inflation and weaker pressures in the economy. Through autumn, statistics did not favour either alternative, but now we see signs of both. This may increase the uncertainty surrounding the state of the Norwegian economy. Monetary policy must strike a balance between the various objectives. Strong growth in the Norwegian economy, a tighter labour market, a pronounced rise in equity prices and high credit growth must be weighed against unexpectedly low inflation.  We have illustrated the uncertainty surrounding forecasts for the interest rate, inflation and the output gap with fan charts. The width of the fan charts is based on historical disturbances. However, there is no certainty that future disturbances will be of the same nature and scale. The wider the fan charts are, the more uncertain the projections. Uncertainty surrounding the interest rate reflects the monetary policy response to unexpected disturbances to inflation, output and the exchange rate.  On the basis of the analysis in the Inflation Reports, Norges Bank’s Executive Board assesses the consequences for future interest rate development and adopts a monetary policy strategy for the period to the next Report. The Executive Board’s assessment in its meeting 16 March was that the interest rate may gradually – in small, not too frequent steps – be brought back towards a more normal level. The objective of bringing inflation back to target and anchoring inflation expectations nevertheless implies that monetary policy will remain expansionary. The sight deposit rate should be in the interval 2¼ – 3¼ per cent in the period to the publication of the next Inflation Report on 29 June 2006, conditional on economic developments that are broadly in line with the projections. Norges Bank’s Executive Board also decided at its meeting on 16 March to raise the sight deposit rate by 0.25 percentage point to 2.50 per cent.  BIS Review 22/2006 5 
Ben S Bernanke: Reflections on the yield curve and monetary policy Remarks by Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Economic Club of New York, New York, 20 March 2006. *      *      * I would like to thank the Economic Club of New York for inviting me to speak here this evening. I intend to take the opportunity afforded by an audience of experts on global financial markets to address an intriguing financial phenomenon: the fact that, over the past seven quarters or so, tightening monetary policy has been accompanied by long-term yields that have moved only a little on net. Why have long-term interest rates not risen more, as they have done over previous policy tightening cycles? And what implications does this pattern of long-term interest rates have for monetary policy and the economic outlook? As you will see, in my remarks I will do a better job of raising questions than of answering them. In particular, I will conclude that the implications for monetary policy of the recent behavior of long-term yields are not at all clear-cut. I hope you will agree that these questions are nevertheless worthwhile posing, as they are intertwined with a number of important economic and financial issues. I should say at the outset that the views I will express are my own and are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Federal Reserve's tightening cycle The tightening cycle that began at the end of June 2004 is notable in at least four respects. First, its onset was delayed for longer than many observers expected. The FOMC kept policy unusually accommodative for an extended, or should I say for a considerable, period. The goal, as you know, was to help ensure that the economic expansion would be self-sustaining and to protect against a remote risk that the fall in inflation observed during 2003 might culminate in outright deflation--an outcome that could have had potentially serious consequences for the economy and for the efficacy of monetary policy. Indeed, with those concerns in mind, in 2003 the Federal Reserve made explicit for the first time that price stability is a symmetric objective: It is important to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high. A second way in which the most recent experience has been unusual is the extent to which policy actions have been signaled in advance. Both in the months leading up to the initiation of the tightening cycle and during the cycle itself, the statements issued after each meeting of the FOMC provided qualitative guidance about the likely future path of policy and its dependence on economic events. Providing information about the expected path of policy helped to ensure that long-term interest rates and other asset prices did not build in a projected pace of tightening that was more rapid than the Committee itself anticipated, and the statement's focus on the conditionality of future policy actions emphasized the ongoing need for both policymakers and financial market participants to respond to economic news. In retrospect, the clear communication of policy provided notable benefits, in my view, by increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy while minimizing unnecessary volatility in financial markets. Third, policy moved gradually, tightening in one-quarter point increments over fourteen successive meetings. Together with expanded communication, this gradual approach served to stabilize policy expectations and damp market volatility. In addition, the measured pace of rate increases gave the Committee time to observe the progress of the economy and to adjust its plans and communications strategy accordingly.1 To be sure, gradualism was possible only because inflation expectations remained contained--testimony to the importance of a central bank's retaining credibility in financial markets and among businesses and households. A fourth interesting aspect of the latest tightening cycle, which is my principal focus this evening, is the behavior of long-term interest rates. Since June 30, 2004, the overnight interest rate has moved up 3-1/2 percentage points, but the ten-year nominal Treasury yield has only edged higher. At less than 4-                                                      1  I spoke about this in more detail in "Gradualism," a speech delivered at an economics luncheon co-sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (Seattle Branch) and the University of Washington, Seattle, May 20, 2004.

3/4 percent, that yield is not much above the target federal funds rate of 4-1/2 percent and, indeed, is about even with yields for maturities of one to three years. In the remainder of my remarks I will speculate on the reasons for and consequences of this historically unusual behavior of long-term rates. The recent behavior of longer-term yields Some discussion of the arithmetic of longer-term yields provides a useful perspective on recent developments in bond markets. The ten-year Treasury yield, for example, can be viewed as a weighted average of the current one-year rate and nine one-year forward rates, with the weights depending on the coupon yield of the security. As I will discuss, each of these forward rates can be split further into (1) a portion equal to the one-year spot rate that market participants currently expect to prevail at the corresponding date in the future, and (2) a portion that reflects additional compensation to the bondholder for the risk of holding longer-dated instruments.  Current and near-term forward rates are particularly sensitive to monetary policy actions, which directly affect spot short-term interest rates and strongly influence market expectations of where spot rates are likely to stand in the next year or two. Indeed, as we would expect, the recent tightening of policy has been accompanied by increases in both the current one-year rate and next few years' forward rates. For example, since June 2004, the one-year forward rate for the period two to three years in the future has risen almost 1-1/2 percentage points. As the ten-year yield is about unchanged even as its near-term components have risen appreciably, it follows as a matter of arithmetic that its components representing returns that are more distant in time must have fallen. In fact, the one-year forward rate nine years ahead has declined 1-1/2 percentage points over this tightening cycle. Incidentally, by comparing forward rates implied by yields on nominal Treasuries with those implied by Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation, we can infer that about two-thirds of the overall decline in far-distant nominal forward rates over this tightening cycle has been associated with a drop in real yields, with the remainder reflecting a drop in inflation compensation.  It is important to note that the marked decline in far-forward interest rates has not been confined to U.S. Treasury securities. The spread in yields between Treasuries and longer-term private securities such as corporate bonds is little changed or is down on net since June 2004, implying that essentially all of the fall in forward rates seen in the Treasury market has occurred in private yields as well. These patterns have also appeared in securities not denominated in dollars. For example, over the same period, longer-term government and swap yields in the United Kingdom and the euro area have moved appreciably lower. Indeed, long-term nominal yields have dropped in a number of countries, often by more than in the United States, and the yield curves in many of these countries are also rather flat or even slightly inverted. Some reasons for the decline in far-forward rates  Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years? Observers have offered two broad (and not mutually exclusive) classes of explanations. One set of explanations holds that bond yields are reacting to current or prospective macroeconomic conditions. Another set focuses on special factors that may have influenced market demands for long-term securities per se, independent of the economic outlook. I will first consider explanations that emphasize possible changes in the net demand for long-term securities and later return to explanations that focus on the link between bond yields and the economic outlook. As I have noted, each of the forward interest rates implicit in the term structure can be usefully decomposed into two parts: (1) the spot interest rate that market participants currently expect to prevail at the corresponding date in the future and (2) the additional compensation that investors require for the risk of holding longer-term instruments, known as the term premium. With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium. In particular, if the demand for long-dated securities rises relative to the supply, then investors will generally accept less compensation to hold longer-term instruments--that is, the term premium will decline.  To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates. In modern models of the term structure, yields at each horizon are explained by a small number 2 BIS Review 21/2006 
of factors. In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations. These factors, in turn, can be used to estimate term premiums at each point in time, although one should clearly acknowledge that the results can be sensitive to various statistical and modeling assumptions. According to several of the most popular models, a substantial portion of the decline in distant-horizon forward rates over recent quarters can be attributed to a drop in term premiums.2 Using some of these models, we can further divide the term premium into two parts--a premium for bearing real interest rate risk and a premium for bearing inflation risk. Both of these components have trended lower over time as well, according to the standard models, but the decline in the premium since last June 2004 appears to have been associated mainly with a drop in the compensation for bearing real interest rate risk.  At least four possible explanations have been put forth for why the net demand for long-term issues may have increased, lowering the term premium. First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally. With the benefit of hindsight, we now recognize that an important change occurred in the U.S. economy (and, indeed, in other major industrial economies as well) sometime in the mid-1980s. Since that time, the volatilities of both real GDP growth and inflation have declined significantly, a phenomenon that economists have dubbed the "Great Moderation." I have argued elsewhere that improved monetary policies, which stabilized inflation and better anchored inflation expectations, are an important reason for this positive development; no doubt, structural changes in the economy such as deregulation, improved inventory control methods, and better risk-sharing in financial markets also contributed.3 Whatever the reason for the fall in macroeconomic volatility, if investors have come to expect this past performance to continue, they might believe that less compensation for risk--and thus a lower term premium--is required to justify holding longer-term bonds. In that regard, it is interesting to observe that long-term forward rates were also low in the 1950s and 1960s. With long-term inflation expectations apparently anchored at low levels and with the prospect of continued economic stability, market participants may believe that it is appropriate to price bonds for an environment like that which prevailed four or five decades ago. A second possible explanation of the evident decline in the term premium is linked to the increased intervention in currency markets by a number of governments, particularly in Asia. According to this explanation, foreign official institutions, primarily central banks, have invested the bulk of their greatly expanded dollar holdings in U.S. Treasuries and closely substitutable securities, and these demands by the official sector have put downward pressure on yields. This interpretation has some support, including research that I did with two coauthors that found that longer-term yields came under significant downward pressure during episodes of heavy official purchases of dollars in 2004.4 And financial-market participants appear to be especially sensitive to any suggestion that foreign official entities may alter their portfolio preferences. However, these observations speak more to the existence of a short-term impact of large purchases and sales--the result of limits to liquidity in the very short run--than to the perhaps more important question of whether those transactions have a lasting effect on yields. On this latter issue, clear evidence is harder to come by. Several pieces of indirect evidence suggest that the long-term effect of foreign purchases on yields may be moderate. Notably, the global market for dollar-denominated bonds is enormous--perhaps around $25 trillion, including dollar-denominated debt issued by other countries as well as debt issued abroad by U.S. residents. In the long run, therefore, the market should be able to absorb purchases and sales of large absolute magnitude with relatively modest changes in yields. Indeed, long-term yields continued to fall over recent quarters even as foreign official holdings of Treasury securities increased at a slower pace than previously.                                                        2  Don H.

Reinhart (2004), "Monetary Policy Alternatives at the Zero Bound: An Empirical Assessment," Brookings Papers on Economic Analysis (2), pp. 1-100. BIS Review 21/2006 3 
The performance of Treasuries relative to that of other fixed-income instruments also argues against a dominant influence of foreign official portfolio decisions on long-term rates. If foreign official holdings of Treasuries were the source of the decline in their yields, then we would expect to observe increased spreads between yields on Treasury securities and the returns to other types of debt less favored by foreign official holders. But we have not seen a significant widening of private yield spreads relative to Treasuries--quite the contrary--and, as I noted earlier, yields in other industrial economies have fallen as well, in many cases by more than U.S. yields. A reasonable conclusion is that the accumulation of dollar reserves abroad has influenced U.S. yields, but reserve accumulation abroad is not the only, or even the dominant, explanation for their recent behavior. Changes in the management of and accounting for pension funds are a third possible source of a declining term premium. Reforms proposed in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are widely expected to encourage pension funds to be more fully funded and to take steps to better match the duration of their assets and liabilities. Together with the increased need of aging populations in the industrial countries to prepare for retirement, these changes may have increased the demand for longer-maturity securities. We have seen little direct evidence to date of sizable pension-fund portfolio shifts toward long-duration bonds, at least in the United States. But judging from anecdotal reports, bond investors might be attaching significant odds to scenarios in which pension funds tilt the composition of their portfolios toward such assets substantially over time. Fourth and finally, as investors' demands for long-duration securities may have increased over the past few years, the supply of such securities seems not to have kept pace. The average maturity of outstanding Treasury debt, for example, has dropped by 1-1/2 years since its peak in 2001, a trend just now beginning to turn with the Treasury's reissuance of the thirty-year bond. Corporations and households, however, have taken advantage of low long-term rates to lengthen the duration of their debt in recent years, which has compensated to some extent for the reduced duration of available Treasury debt. Long-term yields and monetary policy What does the historically unusual behavior of long-term yields imply for the conduct of monetary policy? The answer, it turns out, depends critically on the source of that behavior. To the extent that the decline in forward rates can be traced to a decline in the term premium, perhaps for one or more of the reasons I have just suggested, the effect is financially stimulative and argues for greater monetary policy restraint, all else being equal. Specifically, if spending depends on long-term interest rates, special factors that lower the spread between short-term and long-term rates will stimulate aggregate demand. Thus, when the term premium declines, a higher short-term rate is required to obtain the long-term rate and the overall mix of financial conditions consistent with maximum sustainable employment and stable prices. However, if the behavior of long-term yields reflects current or prospective economic conditions, the implications for policy may be quite different--indeed, quite the opposite. The simplest case in point is when low or falling long-term yields reflect investor expectations of future economic weakness. Suppose, for example, that investors expect economic activity to slow at some point in the future. If investors expect that weakness to require policy easing in the medium term, they will mark down their projected path of future spot interest rates, lowering far-forward rates and causing the yield curve to flatten or even to invert. Indeed, historically, the slope of the yield curve has tended to decline significantly in advance of recessions. What is the relevance of this scenario for today? Although macroeconomic forecasting is fraught with hazards, I would not interpret the currently very flat yield curve as indicating a significant economic slowdown to come, for several reasons. First, in previous episodes when an inverted yield curve was followed by recession, the level of interest rates was quite high, consistent with considerable financial restraint. This time, both short- and long-term interest rates--in nominal and real terms--are relatively low by historical standards.5 Second, as I have already discussed, to the extent that the flattening or inversion of the yield curve is the result of a smaller term premium, the implications for future                                                       5  This is consistent with empirical work in Ben S. Bernanke and Alan S. Blinder 1992), "The Federal Funds Rate and the Channels of Monetary Transmission," American Economic Review, vol. 82 (September), pp. 901-21. In that paper, we found that the level of the federal funds rate was extremely informative about future movements of real macroeconomic variables. 4 BIS Review 21/2006 
economic activity are positive rather than negative.6 Finally, the yield curve is only one of the financial indicators that researchers have found useful in predicting swings in economic activity. Other indicators that have had empirical success in the past, including corporate risk spreads, would seem to be consistent with continuing solid economic growth. In that regard, the fact that actual and implied volatilities of most financial prices remain subdued suggests that market participants do not harbor significant reservations about the economic outlook.  An alternative perspective holds that the recent behavior of interest rates does not presage an economic slowdown but suggests instead that the level of real interest rates consistent with full employment in the long run--the natural interest rate, if you will--has declined. For example, some observers have pointed to factors that may create a longer-term drag on the growth in household spending, including high energy costs, the likelihood of slower growth in house prices, and a possible reversal of recent declines in saving rates. If these drags on the growth of spending do materialize, then a lower real interest rate will be needed to sustain aggregate demand and keep the economy near full employment. To be consistent with a lower long-term real rate, the short-term policy rate might have to be lower than it would otherwise be as well.  Given the global nature of the decline in yields, an explanation less centered on the United States might be required. About a year ago, I offered the thesis that a "global saving glut"--an excess, at historically normal real interest rates, of desired global saving over desired global investment--was contributing to the decline in interest rates.7 In brief, I argued that this shift reflects the confluence of several forces. On the saving side, the factors include rapid growth in high-saving countries on the Pacific Rim, export-focused economic development strategies that directly or indirectly hold back the growth of domestic demand, and the surge in revenues enjoyed by oil producers. On the investment side, notable factors restraining the global demand for capital include the legacy of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, which led to continuing sluggishness in investment in some of those economies, and the slower growth of the workforce in many industrial countries. So long as these factors persist, global equilibrium interest rates (and, consequently, the neutral policy rate) will be lower than they otherwise would be. Conclusion What conclusion should we draw? Clearly, bond prices, like other asset prices, incorporate a great deal of information that is potentially very relevant to policymakers. However, the information is not always easy to extract and--as in the current situation--the bottom line for policy appears ambiguous. In particular, to the extent that the recent behavior of long-term rates reflects a declining term premium, the policy rate associated with a given degree of financial stimulus will be higher than usual. But to the extent that long-term rates have been influenced by macroeconomic conditions, including such factors as trends in global saving and investment, the required policy rate will be lower. Given this reality, policymakers are well advised to follow two principles familiar to navigators throughout the ages: First, determine your position frequently. Second, use as many guides or landmarks as are available.  In the context of monetary policy, these principles suggest that policymakers should monitor bond yields carefully in judging the current state of the economy--but only in tandem with the signals from other important financial variables; direct readings on spending, production, and prices; and a goodly helping of qualitative information. Ultimately, a robust approach to policymaking requires the use of multiple sources of information and multiple methods of analysis, combined with frequent reality checks. By not tying policy to a small set of forecast indicators, we may sacrifice some degree of simplicity, but we are less likely to be misled when a favored variable behaves in an unusual manner.                                                       6  See the discussion in Jonathan H.

Donald L Kohn: Monetary policy and asset prices Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at “Monetary Policy: A Journey from Theory to Practice”, a European Central Bank Colloquium held in honor of Otmar Issing, Frankfurt, 16 March 2006.  References for this speech can be found on the US Federal Reserve Systems’s website. *      *      * I am honored to participate in this tribute to Otmar Issing. I have known and admired Otmar for some time. It has been a source of great pride that he has considered me a worthy intellectual sparing partner over the years. From the hiking trails of Jackson Hole to the restaurants of Frankfurt and at many conferences in between, we have challenged each other to state our assumptions, examine the evidence, and adjust our conclusions accordingly. I have derived enormous benefit from that give-and-take--a sentiment, I am sure, that many others in this room share.  I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late--namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy. Otmar and I have debated this issue on many occasions, and these discussions--together with recent research carried out at the European Central Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, and elsewhere--have been both challenging and stimulating. The preparation of this talk has afforded me a welcome opportunity to reexamine my thinking on this subject. So, today, I will review the arguments and the evidence as I see them and draw out the conclusions to which I am currently led.  At the outset, let me stress that I will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1  Two strategies for dealing with market bubbles Most fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation. But many argue that pronounced booms and busts in asset markets are another matter, especially if actual valuations appear to be misaligned with fundamentals. What should a central bank do when it suspects it faces a major speculative event--one that might be large enough to threaten economic stability when it unwinds? To help frame the discussion, I will focus on two different strategies that have been proposed for dealing with market bubbles.  The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy--calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years. Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term. Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process. Following this strategy does not imply that policymakers ignore the expected future evolution of speculative activity. If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations. Practically speaking, however, I view our ability to act on such suspicions as limited given how little we know about the dynamics of speculative episodes.  Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices--indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation. It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings.                                                        1  David Reifschneider, of the Federal Reserve Board's staff, contributed substantially to the preparation of these remarks. BIS Review 21/2006 1 
The second strategy, by comparison, is more activist and attempts to damp speculative activity directly. It was described at length in "Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy," an article published by the ECB last year. I quote from the article: "This approach amounts to a cautious policy of 'leaning against the wind' of an incipient bubble. The central bank would adopt a somewhat tighter policy stance in the face of an inflating asset market than it would otherwise allow if confronted with a similar macroeconomic outlook under more normal market conditions. . . . It would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future."2 I am labeling this second approach extra action, as it calls for steps that would not be taken in ordinary circumstances.3  Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble. Thus, the strategy seeks to trade off the near-certainty of worse macroeconomic performance today for the chance of disproportionally better performance in the future, on the theory that the repercussions of a major market correction could be highly nonlinear. But the extra-action proposal is by no means a bold call for central banks to prick market bubbles. As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession. Rather, the extra-action strategy is intended only to provide some limited insurance against the possibility of highly adverse events occurring down the road.  Common ground I will be talking at length about the differences between the two strategies, but I must stress up front how much they have in common. Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework. Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies.  At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level. Of course, we may not be prepared to write down a specific loss function and say, "There, that's what I'm minimizing." But our deliberative processes and our actions seem broadly consistent with that characterization of the general problem. This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area. Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well.  We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is market-determined and easily liquified. Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending. Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services. Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending. In cases of sharply falling market valuations, these adverse credit-channel effects may even be exacerbated by the deteriorating health of banks and other financial institutions. In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time.  Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts. In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass. While no one uses formal                                                       2  European Central Bank (2005), "Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy" (1.7 MB PDF), Monthly Bulletin (April), p. 58. 3  The article's label for this strategy--leaning against the wind--has been used for many years to describe the standard behavior of central banks. Given this history, I think that using the term extra action is less confusing. 2 BIS Review 21/2006 
Bayesian methods to solve this difficult problem, I think most policymakers do engage in at least an informal weighing of the various possibilities and their implications when setting policy.  Three conditions for extra action to lead to better outcomes Now let me turn from areas of agreement to more contentious issues, ones that have a strong bearing on the relative merits of the two strategies. As the ECB article notes, extra action is often seen as a type of insurance. And as with any insurance policy, before you buy you have to ask whether the expected benefits outweigh the costs. As I see it, extra action pays only if three tough conditions are met. First, policymakers must be able to identify bubbles in a timely fashion with reasonable confidence. Second, there must be a fairly high probability that a modestly tighter policy will help to check the further expansion of speculative activity. And finally, the expected improvement in future economic performance that would result from a less expansive bubble must be sizable. You may be thinking that, in stating the three conditions, I have slanted the case with such phrases as "reasonable confidence" and "fairly high probability." But stick with me, and I hope to persuade you that these probabilistic qualifiers are needed to judge the merits of extra action.  For the moment, let me set aside the first condition and assume that central banks can distinguish an emerging bubble from improving fundamentals at an early stage. What about the other two conditions? Should we presume that a limited application of restrictive policy would materially restrain the speculative boom and make its eventual unwinding less disruptive for the overall economy?  Consider the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-to-late 1990s. The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices. How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future. In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals. But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies. At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects.  In general, we have a very poor understanding of the forces driving speculative bubbles and the role played by monetary policy. In fact, we cannot rule out perverse effects.4 Again, consider the U.S. experience of the late 1990s. When the FOMC tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell--perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained. Since mid-2004, we have seen a marked decline in bond-term premiums, even as the funds rate has risen steadily. These episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction.  Perhaps housing markets differ from equity and bond markets. For example, homeowners, who may have a less sophisticated understanding of the economy than professional investors, might mistakenly view a one-time rise in home prices--resulting, say, from a decline in interest rates--as evidence of a more persistent upward trend. If so, a monetary easing directed at stabilizing output and inflation might, conceivably, drive up real estate values by more than fundamentals alone would merit. Still, you would expect any mis-pricing from these sources to be reversed over time as interest rates returned to normal. In any event, empirical evidence on this issue is scanty. More broadly, further research into the causal connections, if any, between monetary policy and bubbles would seem to be needed before we would know enough to be able to act on such linkages with much confidence.5                                                        4  From a theoretical standpoint, the "rational bubble" literature demonstrates how a rise in interest rates might lead rational agents to boost the growth rate of asset prices during a speculative episode. 5  Recently, ECB staff economists Carsten Detken and Frank Smets have taken a laudable first step at addressing this issue in a paper that establishes some of the basic empirical facts about the correlations among interest rates, money, credit, asset prices, financial distress, and macroeconomic performance. See Carsten Detken and Frank Smets (2004) "Asset Price Booms and Monetary Policy" (882 KB PDF), European Central Bank Working Paper Series 364, (Frankfurt: ECB, May). BIS Review 21/2006 3 
However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble. Even then, with the second condition now met, the third condition might not hold: The expected improvement in future macroeconomic performance from moderating the bubble's expansion may not be enough to more than offset the up-front costs of extra action. To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future.  Admittedly, if the worst-outcome scenario associated with an unchecked bubble is judged sufficiently dire and if the scenario is not seen as too improbable, then a risk-averse policymaker might regard the expected return from extra action insurance as worth its upfront cost. However, our confidence in such an assessment would seem to hinge on believing that the effects of market corrections could be markedly nonlinear. Proponents of extra action often cite an increased risk of severe financial distress as a potential source of such effects. However, without the onset of deflation, how large is this risk? In recent history, the health of the U.S. financial system remained solid after the collapse of the high-tech boom, despite the bankruptcy of dozens of telecom and dot-com firms, the loss of more than $8 trillion in stock market wealth, and stress in the nonfinancial corporate sector. Moreover, the financial sectors of most other developed economies also weathered the worldwide drop in corporate equity values fairly well.  Of course, the nonlinear risks associated with a collapsing bubble may depend on the initial health of the financial system, and under some circumstances we could be worried about the potential for significant financial distress to accompany the bursting of a bubble, should that bubble expand further. Even in such cases, however, I wonder whether good prudential supervision in advance and prompt action to clean up any lingering structural problems afterward would not be better ways to deal with this possibility. Certainly, closer oversight of banking systems during the 1980s, including the United States, would have left many economies in a stronger position during the early 1990s. This lesson has been absorbed by supervisory authorities around the world, as evidenced by our successful efforts to strengthen bank capital and our financial systems.  I do agree that market corrections can have profoundly adverse consequences if they lead to deflation, as illustrated by the United States after the 1929 stock market crash and the more recent experience of Japan. But it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses. In Japan, deflation could probably have been avoided if the initial monetary response to the slump in real estate and stock market values had been more aggressive; in addition, macroeconomic performance would have been better if the government had dealt more promptly with the structural problems of the banking sector.6 As for the Great Depression, the Federal Reserve actually worsened the situation by allowing the money supply to contract sharply in 1930 and 1931, after unwisely attempting to prick the stock market bubble in the first place. Rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound. By doing so, policymakers should be able to avoid the severe nonlinear dynamics of deflation.  Proponents of extra action often argue that it should reduce the risk of hitting the zero bound, but we should recognize that under some circumstances extra action may actually exacerbate the problem. To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts. Now the central bank contemplates taking extra action. In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small. In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand. With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble                                                       6  See Alan G. Ahearne, Joseph E. Gagnon, Jane Haltmaier, and Steven B. Kamin (2002), "Preventing Deflation: Lessons from Japan's Experience in the 1990s," International Finance Discussion Paper Series 2002-729 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June). 4 BIS Review 21/2006 
bursts. Under these conditions, extra action would therefore worsen expected economic performance, not improve it.  Another purported benefit of extra action is that, by raising the cost of capital to firms and households, it helps reduce overinvestment fostered during speculative booms, thereby making it easier for the economy to recover after the bubble collapses. However, we should be careful not to exaggerate the macroeconomic importance of such capital mis-allocation. True, the U.S. high-tech boom led to overinvestment in some sectors, wasting resources and creating lingering difficulties while capital overhangs were eliminated. But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years.  Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals. Thus, mitigating capital misallocation in one sector would have created capital misallocations elsewhere, making the assessment of the net gain from extra action difficult. And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation.  Now I would like to return to the first condition, the one I sidestepped a few minutes ago--the question of identifying market bubbles in a timely fashion. The ECB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate. For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain.  Under extra action, mistakenly identifying a bubble has significant costs. By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose. Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses. But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time. And the mistaken call would have reduced welfare by needlessly inducing fluctuations in the macroeconomy.  Timing is also an issue. Let us suppose that the evidence is so compelling that policymakers become fairly confident that valuations are excessively rich. Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability. The market correction could occur with policy in a tighter position but before extra action had enough time to materially influence speculative activity.  Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits. Such talk might do some good by prompting investors to stop and rethink their assumptions. And talk by itself should not do much lasting harm even if valuations turn out to be justified--provided, however, that words are not seen as precursors to action under circumstances in which conventional policy would still be the best approach.  To wrap up this critique, I summarize as follows: If we can identify bubbles quickly and accurately, are reasonably confident that tighter policy would materially check their expansion, and believe that severe market corrections have significant non-linear adverse effects on the economy, then extra action may well be merited. But if even one of these tough conditions is not met, then extra action would be more likely to lead to worse macroeconomic performance over time than that achievable with conventional policies that deal expeditiously with the effects of the unwinding of the bubbles when they occur. For my part, I am dubious that any central banker knows enough about the economy to overcome these hurdles. However, I would not want to rule out the possibility that in some circumstances, or perhaps at some point in the future when our understanding of asset markets and the economy has increased, such a course of action would be appropriate.  Asymmetries and moral hazard Proponents of extra action have their own bones to pick with the conventional strategy, especially as it relates to the alleged asymmetric nature of the policy's response to asset market booms and busts. In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC's actions over the past twenty years, the BIS Review 21/2006 5 
Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems.  This argument strikes me as a misreading of history. U.S. monetary policy has responded symmetrically to the implications of asset-price movements for actual and projected developments in output and inflation, consistent with its mandate. The most convincing evidence for this statement can be found in the results: Interest rates have been consistent with underlying inflation remaining reasonably stable for some time now, accompanied by relatively mild fluctuations in real activity.7  Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk. Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a "Greenspan put," stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy. Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were. The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions. Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves.  Ironically, one can argue that extra action may pose a more significant risk of moral hazard. It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some "appropriate" level. How does this strategy play out if a central bank takes extra action and speculative activity continues unabated or even intensifies? Do policymakers raise rates even further above levels consistent with conventional policy and, if so, at what consequences for the economy? And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices? If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase?  Conclusion My remarks today have been intended as a salute to Otmar and to all the valuable contributions he has made over the years to my thinking and to that of policymakers around the world. Otmar, you have taught me much about intellectual rigor in support of central bank contributions to economic welfare--and about friendship. Weighing the relative merits of extra action and conventional policy is not easy and requires a nuanced interpretation of the arguments and the evidence, as well as some hard thinking. Otmar and his colleagues have done this in advancing the case for extra action, and by so doing they have given me a good intellectual workout--and Otmar, I thank you for that. I hope my response has provided a good workout in return. I look forward to continuing the debate and especially the friendship for many years to come.                                                        7  As evidence of asymmetry, observers often cite Claudio E.V. Borio and Philip Lowe (2004), "Securing Sustainable Price Stability: Should Credit Come Back from the Wilderness?" Bank for International Settlements Working Paper 157 (Basel: BIS, July). The authors purport to show that the federal funds rate was unusually low during the headwinds period of the early 1990s but not correspondingly high before the onset of the 1990 recession. But their assessment is made in relation to the Taylor rule, which is not a particularly good description of monetary policy during this period of opportunistic disinflation. In the event, inflation in the United States came down steadily over the first half of the 1990s, accompanied by significant economic slack--results that seem to belie the claim that policy was overly easy. 6 BIS Review 21/2006 
Svante Öberg: Sweden – a low inflation economy Speech by Mr Svante Öberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at Stockholm University, Stockholm, 21 March 2006. Diagrams for the speech can be found on the Sveriges Riksbank’s website. *   *   * Introduction I shall begin by thanking you for the invitation. It is always a pleasure to come back to Stockholm University, where I myself was a student. I have worked with economics for most of my professional life. Prior to taking up my post at the Riksbank I had, for instance, been under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Finance, Director General of the National Institute of Economic Research and adviser at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. I intend to use the experience this has given me to provide a long-term perspective to the current economic situation. My theory for the day is that "Things are better now". I shall cover the following areas in my speech: The first part will deal with the Swedish economy in a slightly longer term perspective going back to the 1960s. There I shall discuss some episodes during the past 30 years that have coloured my perception of the Swedish economy and of what is important for monetary policy. The second part will deal with the current economic situation and current monetary policy. Swedish economy 1960-2005 I shall begin with a description of the Swedish economy during the period 1960-2005 and start with a picture of inflation in Sweden and Germany during this period. Inflation has been higher in Sweden than in Germany for long periods of time. During the 1960s we more or less kept pace with Germany. However, during the second half of the 1970s and in the 1980s, inflation in Sweden was several percentage points higher than that in Germany each year. Since the beginning of the 1990s, inflation in Sweden has once again been roughly the same as that in Germany. Sweden has become a low inflation economy. What, on the whole, has happened since the 1960s? To illustrate this, I shall talk about some of the episodes of the past 30 years that have had great significance for economic developments and for my own view of the Swedish economy. I have been able to follow the economic policy decision-making process connected with these episodes at close quarters from my various posts in public administration. I would like to emphasise that this is my personal view of developments and not the Riksbank’s official view. The episode I will talk about include the cost crisis in the 1970s and overheating in the 1980s, the change in exchange rate and monetary policy, the wage formation reform and budget consolidation of the 1990s. The cost crisis of the 1970s During the 1960s, economic growth in Sweden wad good. GDP growth was at a high level, inflation was moderate, unemployment was low, foreign trade was largely in balance and public finances were strong. I usually look at these five economic variables when trying to gain an impression of a country’s overall macroeconomic development and I will return to them often during my speech. During the 1970s a number of events occurred that had serious consequences for the Swedish economy. Oil prices rose substantially in 1973, which led to much higher inflation than could be considered justified by the actual oil price. Internationally, this became the start of a long period of low growth. In Sweden the government invested in economic stimulation to bridge over the coming economic recession. The central wage agreements signed for 1975-76 were therefore at a very high level, which together with wage drift and increased employer contributions meant that the wage costs per hour BIS Review 21/2006 1 
rose by a total of 38 per cent. Sweden’s competitiveness thus deteriorated substantially. Our labour costs per unit produced in industry in relation to the corresponding costs in other countries rose by around 25 per cent between 1974 and 1977. At that time, Sweden had an exchange rate regime with a fixed exchange rate. After World War Two, almost all western countries’ currencies were pegged to the United States dollar, which in turn had a fixed price against gold. The system came into force in 1944 and was called the Bretton Woods System. When this system broke down in 1973, a currency collaboration was started up between a number of European countries, known as the currency snake, by which the krona was pegged to a currency basket dominated by the German D-mark. In 1977 Sweden left the currency snake and the krona was pegged to a currency basket where the dollar had a double weight in relation to the trade exchange. In 1991 the krona was instead pegged to the European currency unit, the ecu. During the 1970s, Sweden was still applying credit and foreign exchange regulations. The credit regulation limited the banks’ lending and foreign exchange regulation limited the opportunities to move currency, securities and capital across borders. Both types of regulation entailed limiting the opportunities for efficient allocation of capital and they became increasingly difficult to maintain as time went by. The credit market was deregulated in 1985 and the final parts of the foreign exchange regulation were abolished in 1989. The idea behind an exchange rate regime with a fixed exchange rate is that inflation in Sweden will adapt to inflation in other countries. Economists usually call this international inflation functioning as a nominal anchor. However, it did not succeed, as Sweden did not manage to stay even with other countries regarding inflation and cost developments. The economic policy conducted and the way the economy functioned during the 1970s were not compatible with a fixed exchange rate. This resulted in a series of devaluations, a smaller one of 3 per cent in 1976, two of them, 6 per cent and 10 per cent, in 1977, one of 10 per cent in 1981 and a large devaluation of 16 per cent in 1982. Overheating in the 1980s The 1980s thus began with two devaluations in 1981 and 1982. The background to these was that the end of the 1970s and beginning of the 1980s had been very problematic. GDP growth had been poor, and production actually fell a couple of years. Unemployment had risen to 3-4 per cent, which was then regarded as a very high level. Inflation had soared to levels of 15 per cent. The current account and public finances showed a substantial deficit. Sweden found itself in a situation with weak real growth and twin financial deficits. I took part in the preparations for the devaluation in 1982, in connection with the change of government that year. The preparations were led by Kjell-Olof Feldt, Erik Åsbrink and Michael Sohlman. I had the task of making calculations of economic developments over the coming years, based on different economic policy alternatives. Two of the alternatives concerned expansionary fiscal policy to bring down unemployment and a strongly contractionary fiscal and monetary policy to eliminate the twin deficits. In both cases, substantial problems remained in the Swedish economy. The third alternative concerned a devaluation of 20 per cent in autumn 1982, combined with a price stoppage and pegging the krona to the D-mark. The calculations indicated that industrial production and investment would increase, public finances would improve, the current account deficit would disappear, employment would increase and unemployment would be kept down. After Kjell-Olof Feldt had made contact with the Nordic finance ministers and central bank governors, as well as the German central bank governor, the size of the devaluation was altered to 16 per cent and the planned pegging of the krona to the German D-mark was postponed indefinitely. I had reason to return to these calculations later on during the 1980s and I could observe that they were pretty accurate on most points, except with regard to price and wage developments. I had assumed that inflation and wage increases would adjust downwards to the international level. For devaluation to be successful, price and wage developments must be kept down after the devaluation. However, this was not the case. Sweden had an inflation rate much higher than that in Germany every year of the 1980s.  Economic policy was not sufficiently strict during the 1980s to keep down price and wage increases after the devaluations in 1981 and 1982. Although public sector finances improved substantially, this was primarily due to automatic improvements resulting from a number of years of good growth. While monetary policy was strict in the sense that both nominal and real interest rates were kept at a high 2 BIS Review 21/2006 
level to protect the krona, at the same time credit regulations were abolished in 1985, which led to a huge credit boom that increased demand and pushed up property prices. The excessive price and wage increases led to Sweden's cost level once again deteriorating substantially in relation to other countries. At the end of the 1980s, relative costs per produced unit had increased to the level prevailing prior to the devaluations at the beginning of the 1980s and we once again had problems with the twin deficits in the current account and public finances. The problems were aggravated by an international economic downswing at the beginning of the 1990s and by the fact that household saving increased considerably after the tax reform implemented at the beginning of the 1990s. The property bubble that had arisen in the wake of the deregulation of the credit market burst, which resulted in the whole of the Swedish banking system being on the verge of bankruptcy in 1992. Large currency flows in autumn 1992 made fiscal policy spending cuts necessary and led to a powerful defence of the Swedish krona by the Riksbank with interest rates creeping up in stages. In the end, it was necessary to give up. The krona was allowed to float, leaving the peg against the ecu in November 1992, and it depreciated by 20-25 per cent. The conclusions I have drawn from developments during the 1970s and 1980s are that the economic policy conducted together with the functioning of the economy during this period could not lay a foundation for macroeconomic stability and good economic growth. Price and wage formation that got out of hand in the 1970s, a series of devaluations that created considerable pressure in the economy during the 1980s, deregulation of the credit market that triggered a large credit boom, which could not be counteracted by monetary policy as this was detailed to defend the krona’s fixed exchange rate, and a fiscal policy that could not withstand inflationary pressures. All in all, this led to repeated crises and finally to economic collapse. This leads me in to the next three episodes. The reform of wage formation Before I get into the changeover in exchange rate and monetary policy at the beginning of the 1990s, I want to mention two episodes that have contributed to making the changeover in exchange rate and monetary policy successful with regard to bringing down inflation to a level comparable with other countries. These are the reform in wage formation and the budget consolidation in the 1990s. At the end of the 1980s it had become increasingly evident that Swedish wage formation did not function in a manner compatible with macroeconomic balance. It was common for central wage agreements signed during the 1980s to contain price trend guarantees, wage development guarantees, earnings guarantees, checkpoints etc., which led to prices and wages pushing one another upwards in an increasing spiral. On 1 March 1990, the Government appointed the Rehnberg Commission to follow negotiations of new central wage agreements in the labour market and to act to achieve new agreements that would contain price clauses to replace the agreements for 1990 and new agreements for 1991 and lead to a radical reduction in total wage increases, including wage drift, during 1991. Based on the Commission’s proposals, stabilisation agreements were signed for the period 1 January 1991 – 31 March 1993 for just over 75 per cent of the labour market, which contributed to the rate of wage increasing falling from around 10 per cent in 1990 to 3 – 4 per cent a year during 1992 – 1993. After that, however, the rate of wage increase rose again to around 6 per cent in 1996. In April 1997 I was given the task by Deputy Labour Minister Ulrika Messing of making an inquiry into wage formation and mediation. When I was given this task, the social partners in the industrial sector had recently (in March 1997) signed a new cooperation agreement, known as the Industrial Agreement, whereby the parties took joint responsibility for wage formation in their part of the labour market and had agreed on a regulatory framework for negotiating wage agreements. The agreement was followed up by similar, but not as far-reaching, agreements in other sectors. At the same time, there were substantial parts of the labour market that had no such type of agreement. The inquiry led to a new National Mediation Office being established, with the tasks of mediating in labour disputes and acting to promote an efficient wage formation process. The most important change was in my opinion that a third, independent, party was established in the labour market to promote efficient wage formation. The National Mediation Office has the task of keeping up-to-date with the situation in central wage negotiations and acting to ensure that macroeconomic considerations are taken into account in wage negotiations. The Office was also given increased powers of authority to act in connection with central agreement negotiations, for instance, the BIS Review 21/2006 3 
possibility to call the parties to talks, to provide mediation even if one party was opposed to mediation and to postpone industrial action. The wage statistics improved. The National Institute of Economic Research was given the task of annually producing reports on the economic conditions for wage formation. Over the past 10 years wage formation has functioned much more efficiently. Nominal wage increases have been around 4 per cent a year on average, compared with 8 per cent a year in the 1980s. The agreements no longer contain clauses regarding inflation and so on and wage drift is much more limited. Real wage increases have been on average 3 per cent a year on average, compared with 0 per cent a year in the 1980s. Of course, one can discuss how much regulatory frameworks and institutional conditions surrounding wage negotiations have meant for this development in relation to the general conditions and the increased understanding of the inflation target and of the importance of low, stable inflation. My belief is that they improve the conditions for succeeding in monetary policy’s objective of maintaining price stability. Budget consolidation Following the change of government in October 1994, I returned to the Ministry of Finance after a couple of years as adviser at the International Monetary Fund in Washington to become Under-Secretary of State to Göran Persson. There was basically one task on the agenda; to eliminate the very large budget deficit. The deficit in public sector finances amounted to around 11 per cent of GDP in 1993. After a majority of the Swedish population had expressed their support for Sweden joining the European Union at a referendum held in autumn 1994, this became an additional task, as well as financing Sweden's membership of the EU, which cost in the order of SEK 20 billion a year. The timing for dealing with the deficit was ideal from both a political and an economic viewpoint. Studies made by the OECD indicate that powerful budget consolidation processes have only been carried out in connection with serious crises, and the 1990s began with the most serious recession in Sweden since the Depression of the 1930s. GDP fell three years in a row, 1991-1993, and employment fell by more than 500,000 persons during these three years. At the same time, letting the krona float free in 1992 had led to a depreciation of the krona of around 20-25 per cent and a large increase in exports. There was thus a strong growth in demand from abroad that made it easier to constrict domestic demand. The budget consolidation succeeded beyond expectation. Public finances were improved from a deficit of around 11 per cent of GDP in 1993 to a surplus of around 2 per cent of GDP in 1998. The target had been aimed at achieving a balance in public finances in 1998. The major part of the budget consolidation was achieved by reducing the public expenditure as a percentage of GDP. There are considerable similarities between the problems at the beginning of the 1980s and the 1990s. In both cases, Sweden’s international competitiveness had deteriorated and we had large deficits in both the current account and public finances. However, the major difference between developments in the 1980s and developments in the 1990s was that fiscal policy was much stricter in the 1990s and inflation was brought down to a level comparable with other countries. I have since had reason to go through what happened when confidence was restored in the Swedish economy and economic policy. Despite the decision on budget consolidation essentially being taken by the Government and Parliament in autumn 1994, it took some time before various figures believed it would succeed. The first international recognition of our policy came from the European Commission in spring 1995. I accompanied Göran Persson to Brussels and gave an account of Sweden’s convergence programme to Giovanni Ravasio, who was one of the leading economists at the Commission. Each member state of the EU was to draw up a convergence programme that would show what policy they intended to conduct to achieve stable public finances, low inflation and low interest rates. The Swedish convergence programme was aimed at achieving balance in public finances in 1998, and had the broad support of all of the parties in Parliament with the exception of the Left Party. Ravasio was convinced that the programme was sustainable. 4 BIS Review 21/2006 
It was possible to see in the financial markets that the interest rate differential between Swedish and German long-term bonds began to decline in spring 1995 when the Swedish convergence programme had been decided and even more so in autumn 1995, when it had been approved by the EU’s finance ministers. For the Riksbank it took until the beginning of 1996 before short-term interest rates began to be cut. The krona was still weak during 1995 and inflation was close to 3 per cent. I have also had reason to go over how fiscal policy has been managed, since leaving the Ministry of Finance in 1997 to become head of the National Institute of Economic Research and later General Director of Statistics Sweden in 1999. In June 1999, Finance Minister Bo Ringholm appointed me to assess the reformed budget process. The budget process had been reformed in stages since the end of the 1980s. Following the assessment and with broad political agreement, a Budget Act came into force on 1 January 1997. It contained regulations on, for instance, an expenditure ceiling and guidelines for public expenditure. The main conclusion of the assessment was that the new budget process had functioned well. It had contributed to public expenditure as a percentage of GDP being reduced significantly and to public sector financial saving being turned around from a large deficit to a surplus. Of course, there had been some creative accounting to bring public expenditure under the ceiling, but this was on a relatively small scale. The changeover in exchange rate and monetary policy In 1992, when the fixed exchange rate for the krona could no longer be defended, and we changed over to a floating exchange rate, Sweden found itself in a situation where it had not been since the 1930s. The krona was floating and the fixed exchange rate could no longer function as a nominal anchor for monetary policy. In 1993, the Riksbank specified the objective of monetary policy as being that inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) with effect from 1995 should be 2 per cent a year, with a tolerated deviation of one percentage point above and below this. The exchange rate and monetary policy regime had thereby changed over from a fixed exchange rate regime with monetary policy aimed at maintaining the fixed exchange rate to a floating exchange rate where monetary policy was aimed at keeping inflation low. The inflation target had become the new nominal anchor. However, it was necessary to build up credibility around the new monetary policy and the inflation target. Part of the work of strengthening confidence in monetary policy was to make the Riksbank independent. At the beginning of the 1990s, the Riksbank had begun to be more independent. In 1990 there was a change in the principle that the Under-Secretary at the Ministry of Finance would be chairman of the Riksbank’s General Council. During the changes in government in 1991 and 1994 the Riksbank Governor was not replaced, which had previously been the accepted rule. Membership of the EU in 1995 carried the requirement of adapting Swedish legislation to the EU’s regulatory framework. During the years 1996-97 there was a commission of inquiry that investigated granting the Riksbank formal independence and in 1998 there was a broad political agreement that this would be granted. In 1999 the Riksbank formally received independence, with an Executive Board that makes monetary policy decisions and a statutory inflation target. The changeover in exchange rate and monetary policy and the Riksbank’s increased independence have been important conditions for bringing down inflation to a level that corresponds to other countries. This development has been supported by the budget consolidation and the wage formation reform. Sweden is now once again a low inflation economy, after cost crises and overheating. Over the past 10 years, inflation has varied between just below zero and just over three per cent on an annual rate and inflation expectations have stabilised at around 2 per cent a year. International inflation is also lower now. Both in the EU and the OECD area, inflation is close to 2 per cent a year. The major distinction from before is that the difference in inflation between Sweden and other countries has declined. We once again have an inflation rate comparable with that in Germany. Things also look better in other regards than they did in the 1970s and 1980s. During the 1960s and up to the mid-1970s, Sweden enjoyed high growth, with the exception of a few individual years. This was followed by a period up to the early 1990s when growth was lower and varied considerably. Some years it was even negative. Over the past ten years we have once again enjoyed good and relatively stable growth. If we compare the period 1970-1993 with the past twelve years, we can observe that BIS Review 21/2006 5 
growth was much higher during the latter period of low inflation (almost 3 per cent a year) than during the earlier period of high inflation (almost 2 per cent a year). Real wages have also developed better over the past ten years than during the interim period with higher inflation, despite the fact that nominal wage increases have been lower. During the 1960s and up to the mid-1970s, real wages rose every year, i.e. wage were rising more rapidly than prices. Then followed a period of 20 years when real wages did not rise at all on average. Since the mid-1990s, we have once again enjoyed a period of rising real wages. Higher productivity growth has contributed to this. The current account is showing a very large surplus. Public finances are also showing a surplus, although this does not reach the target of 2 per cent over an economic cycle. On the other hand, unemployment is now higher than before. During a very long period up to the beginning of the 1990s, unemployment was very low in Sweden. Open unemployment varied between 1 and 4 per cent. In recent years, it has varied between 4 and 6 per cent, following a peak of 9 per cent in 1997. When I studied economics at university, we were taught that lower inflation was linked to higher unemployment. This relationship was illustrated by the Phillips curve. However, later research has shown that in the longer term there is no connection between inflation and unemployment. At the same time, I believe that the problems in the 1970s and 1980s could partly be explained by the Swedish economy being unable to manage the low unemployment we had then without excessive price and wage increases ensuing. For me, one of the most important tasks of economic policy over the coming years is to bring down unemployment. However, the Riksbank is unable to do very much about this. The Riksbank’s contribution is to safeguard the inflation target and in this way create favourable conditions for growth and employment. All in all, my picture is still that the Swedish economy has functioned much better over the past ten years than in the 1970s and 1980s. Things are better now. Current monetary policy The other part of my presentation is concerned with economic developments and current monetary policy and the reasons why the Executive Board of the Riksbank decided at its most recent monetary policy meeting on 22 February 2006 to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2 per cent. The Riksbank’s view of economic developments over the coming years is presented in the Inflation Report, which was published at the same time as the interest rate decision. This part of my presentation does not contain any new information or new assessments in relation to the February Inflation Report and the separate minutes of the Executive Board meeting. In the light of the picture of economic developments outlined in the February Inflation Report, the Riksbank concluded that there was reason for gradually moving towards a more neutral monetary policy. Although inflation is currently low, developments in the real economy are strong and as capacity utilisation increases, inflation is expected to approach the target of 2 per cent. Raising the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points therefore appeared reasonable. The rate for the continued adjustment of monetary policy will depend as usual on the information received. To understand the aim of monetary policy, it is necessary to be aware that monetary policy normally has an impact with a relatively long time lag. It is not aimed at the current low inflation rate, but at the expected inflation rate a couple of years ahead. One must also take into account the fact that even after raising the repo rate to 2 per cent, monetary policy is still expansionary. During the entire forecast period, the repo rate is expected to be lower than what can be considered an average key rate in the long term, and lending is expected to continue to increase relatively strongly, even after an interest rate rise. In my opinion, the information received recently does not significantly change the picture outlined in the Inflation Report. The National Accounts for the fourth quarter of last year were slightly weaker than expected, but at the same time, the outcome for previous quarters was revised up, so that GDP growth for the year 2005 as a whole was as expected. Inflation was slightly lower than expected in January, but in February inflation was slightly higher than expected. The moving three-month averages in the Labour Force Surveys in February showed largely the same picture of labour market developments as that on which our interest rate decision was based. 6 BIS Review 21/2006 
Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to return to my theme for this talk, namely that things are better now. Of course there are problems now, and of course one can discuss whether monetary policy should provide a little more or less stimulation. However, with the long-term perspective I have tried to provide here today, I believe that Sweden has a much better economic situation now than during the problem years between the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s. We have a regulatory framework for exchange rate and monetary policy, as for fiscal policy, which promotes macroeconomic stability and good economic growth. It is important that we safeguard these regulations. BIS Review 21/2006 7 
Mark W Olson: Are banks still special? Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Annual Washington Conference of the Institute of International Bankers,     Washington, DC, 13 March 2006. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. Over the past twenty years, I have attended many of these Institute of International Bankers (IIB) spring conferences in Washington, D.C., either as a speaker or a participant. These meetings continue to address interesting and pertinent issues. The consistently larger number of attendees at a meeting here in Washington, as opposed to a meeting in one of the more dynamic international financial centers like New York or Los Angeles, reflects this group's clear recognition that public policy has a direct impact on the viability of your respective institutions. Appropriately, most of the topics presented over these two days cover legislative and regulatory issues intermixed with critical strategic issues. For my presentation, I will revisit a topic initially raised twenty-four years ago by a former president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, E. Gerald Corrigan. In 1982, Jerry Corrigan, then the president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, wrote an essay entitled "Are Banks Special?" for the Bank's annual report. Today I would like to revisit the issue and ponder the question "Are Banks Still Special?"  I realize that some of you may be wondering why a focus on the specialness of the domestic U.S. banking industry would be an appropriate topic at a meeting of foreign bank representatives. There are several reasons why the subject is relevant to this group. First, U.S. laws and regulations for foreign banks adhere to the fundamental principle of national treatment. That is, our regulations allow foreign banks to have the same range of product authority as domestic banks. Therefore, any change in policy that affects domestic banks will also potentially affect the range of products foreign banks may offer. Another reason why the issue is likely to be of interest to this audience is that, in any discussion of product authority or regulatory structure, the experiences of other nations are often used as examples. These examples are often presented as policies or practices to be avoided or emulated. But the accuracy of the facts presented to support or oppose other countries' experiences is not always clear. At times, these "facts" may be undocumented generalities or even wild speculation.  Let me return to Corrigan's essay. In 1982, the banking industry was facing an identity crisis unlike any it had faced since the Depression era fifty years earlier. Within a period of a few months in the mid-1930s, Congress (1) required the separation of banking from many securities functions by passing the Glass-Steagall Act, (2) provided protection for bank depositors by passing the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and (3) authorized the creation of a dedicated home mortgage lender by passing the Home Owners' Loan Act. Through these laws, Congress established the legal framework that clearly delineated the competitive relationship for the securities, banking, and thrift industries for close to fifty years. This delineation extended to the marketplace for the banking and securities industries. During this period, there were few issues of controversy between banks and securities firms, the most notable exception being the narrowly focused but heated disagreement as to whether banks should be allowed to underwrite revenue bonds. The Glass-Steagall Act specifically authorized banks to underwrite general obligation bonds, but the act was silent on the issue of revenue bonds. The banking industry viewed that as an oversight; the securities industry viewed it as a purposeful exclusion. This debate went unresolved until 1999, when the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifically authorized revenue bond underwriting by banks. In contrast to the relative peace between banks and securities firms, the competition for deposits between banks and thrifts was quite strong and intensified with the imposition of Regulation Q. Not only did Regulation Q establish ceilings on interest rates for both passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs), the regulation gave thrifts an interest rate advantage of initially 50, then 25, basis points for each of their interest-bearing products. The intense marketplace competition between banks and thrifts was matched by the level of competition in the halls of Congress. Bankers aggressively worked to eliminate that quarter-point rate differential, while thrifts worked equally hard to preserve it.  Such widespread competition was nonexistent between the securities and banking industries. From the 1930s to the late 1970s, there seemed to be a clear distinction between investment and savings or at least between investment dollars and savings dollars. Savings dollars were held in passbook accounts or CDs, and were insured up to certain limits by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) insurance. Investment dollars BIS Review 20/2006 1 
were in equities or bonds. Banks and thrifts waged a turf war against each other, but neither industry aimed its marketing guns or lobbying efforts at the securities industry. Then along came money market mutual funds, or money funds.  High interest rates during the late 1970s and early 1980s had a stunning effect on the flow of deposits into banks and thrifts. Money fund shares issued by investment firms offered market interest rates and a high level of liquidity, through either immediate withdrawal or the ability to effect transactions by using payable-through drafts. By contrast, Regulation Q mandated low interest rates on passbook accounts, specific term restrictions on CDs, and significant penalties for early withdrawal. Money funds offered rates that were at times double the rates on passbook accounts. The banking industry had no products to counter the market appeal. Even though money funds shares are not federally insured, billions of dollars flowed into the accounts. In 1981 alone, $109 billion flowed into money funds. After a tepid and wholly unsuccessful effort by bankers to restrict the growth of money funds, the banking industry began considering a different response. Now that the securities industry had successfully breached the separation between banking and savings by allowing consumers to invest in money funds, the banking industry was forced to examine its fundamental marketplace role. During that period, I was the vice chairman, then the chairman, of the Governmental Relations Committee of the American Bankers Association. At meetings held between 1980 and 1982, as many as 400 bankers representing institutions of all sizes and markets gathered to consider an industry response. Congress's response to the growth of money funds was to pass the Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Garn-St Germain Act of 1982. Taken together, these laws, along with other provisions, eliminated many of the rate and term restrictions on banks' and thrifts' deposit taking and allowed both types of institutions to offer products that could match the rate and liquidity provisions of money funds. But it was clear to many bankers that a lasting response to marketplace changes would require more than just the removal of Regulation Q. Bankers were seeking answers to such basic questions as "What is a bank?" and "What is the public purpose of banking?" Jerry Corrigan's essay proved to be a beacon of rationality in that discussion.  Are banks special?  Corrigan identified three characteristics that made banks special:  - Banks and only banks offered transaction accounts. That is, "they incurred liabilities payable  on demand at par and are readily transferable by the owner to third parties." That transaction  account authority helped "to insure that financial disruptions do not spread." Backed also by  deposit insurance and access to the discount window, banks "reinforced public confidence  that is essential to a healthy economy."  - Corrigan's second criterion identified banks as critical backup sources of liquidity. In fact his  essay stated that "banks are the primary source of liquidity for all other classes and sizes of  institutions, both financial and nonfinancial."  - The third characteristic Corrigan identified is that banks "are the transmission belt for  monetary policy. That role combined with operating the payments mechanism permit the highly  efficient financial markets to function and effect the orderly end of day settlement."  Corrigan went on to address the question "what is a bank," a question that had been complicated by different definitions in different laws. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act defined "bank" differently than the Bank Holding Company Act did, a distinction that allowed commercial entities to own FDIC-insured banks by narrowing their product offerings to meet the BHC Act test. (The Competitive Equality Banking Act reconciled these definitions in 1987.) If banks are special, Corrigan stated, limitations on what services and lines of business banks could offer were justified. Further, the services of businesses that are allowed to be owners of banks should reflect in a nearly symmetric way, the services banks are allowed to offer. Corrigan had made a remarkably prescient observation, as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that would be passed seventeen years later essentially adopted that last criterion in determining what types of corporations could own banks, and what activities could be conducted in those corporations. Between the publication of Corrigan's essay and passage of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, market forces, supported by either regulatory interpretation or court challenges, continued to blur the lines between the banking, securities, and insurance industries. As capital markets expanded, mutual funds put pressure on bank deposits. In Europe, foreign bank successes in securities activities suggested that banks conduct these activities in a safe and sound 2 BIS Review 20/2006 
manner. But until 1999, there was no legislative response to these basic marketplace changes or to the broader question of the separation of banking and commerce.  Separation of banking and commerce The appropriate separation of banking and commerce is a delicate proposition that has both historical and philosophical underpinnings. The term "separation of banking and commerce" can mean different things, depending on the perspective of the person using the term. At the time of Corrigan's essay--the early 1980s--the statutory authority for that separation was largely contained in two laws: the Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial banking from certain investment and securities activities, and the Bank Holding Company Act (with amendments), which narrowly limited the activities of corporations that were allowed to own banks. When it passed in 1956, the Bank Holding Company Act was thought to have been in response to one company's aggressive expansion into banking activities. That company, Transamerica Insurance, had expanded into several western states and concerns were raised about the resulting concentration of financial resources. Therefore, the ensuing body of law on the commerce and banking issue concentrated significantly on separating, or was inspired by desire to separate, banking from securities or banking from insurance. From the time of Corrigan's essay until passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the banking industry had expanded substantially into both the securities and insurance agency fields, though significant restrictions still remained.  Much of the industry's expanded securities authority was gained through the Federal Reserve's approval of securities underwriting for banks, under Section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act. Under the Federal Reserve's rule, a bank subsidiary was "not engaged principally" in securities underwriting if at first 5 percent, then 10 percent, and ultimately 25 percent of its revenue came from underwriting. This expanded authority allowed many banking organizations, though almost exclusively large banks, to significantly expand their domestic securities activities. These same powers were extended to foreign banks operating in the United States.  In insurance, gains for the banking industry were largely the result of court determinations that annuities could be underwritten and sold by banks. Court determinations also expanded national banks' ability to market insurance products. Consequently, banks of all sizes have expanded their involvement in insurance and annuity activities.  By 1999, banks and bank holding companies had gained significant additional product authority in securities and insurance, areas that had been perceived to be on the other side of the banking and commerce wall at the time Corrigan wrote his essay. A number of factors persuaded Congress that federal action was appropriate, and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was passed. Congress had learned from the securities and insurance experiences of foreign banks, both the high points and the low points. On the one hand, institutions in some European countries had successfully broadened their securities and insurance activities. On the other hand, there were lingering questions about whether some Pacific rim banks were too closely linked to certain commercial enterprises in the region, thus facilitating the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. However, the U.S. banking industry had also developed improved ways to manage risk, and banking supervision had become more effective. In addition, the improved analytical capacity offered by new technology, better coordination among domestic and international bank supervisors, a healthy track record for U.S. banks, and the growth of consolidated home-country supervision across the world helped U.S. banks and their affiliates to further expand their commercial activities.  The response of Congress was essentially threefold. First, it moved the separation wall between banking and commerce to reflect what had already occurred in the marketplace: Gramm-Leach-Bliley also addressed the broader question of what types of businesses could own or affiliate with banks by allowing companies to own banking, securities, and insurance entities within a structure known as a financial holding company. Second, Congress provided a way for banks to gain new-product authority when the new products were determined to be financial in nature, incidental to banking, or complimentary to existing banking authority. Third, by clearly separating the federally insured entity--either banks or thrifts--from the newer and potentially higher-risk new-product authorities, Gramm-Leach-Bliley reaffirmed as a matter of public policy that banks continue to be regarded as special. But the act offers a clear acknowledgment that the separation of banking and commerce is not a bright line but is instead a negotiated compromise--one that will continue to move as markets change and products are refined. The guiding consideration in this compromise will be the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund.  BIS Review 20/2006 3 
Are banks still special? Much has changed in the banking landscape since Corrigan wrote his essay twenty-four years ago. Significant increases in international capital flows among bank and nonbank entities, in addition to a broad range of specialized financial instruments mean banks can no longer be considered the only source of transaction accounts. Except for their access to the Federal Reserve discount window, banks are no longer the dominant provider of liquidity for other financial industries. But banks remain the key access point to the dominant wholesale payments network, and they still provide federally insured checking and savings deposits. With the rise of new financial services, products, and techniques, moreover, banks have expanded their role in providing liquidity in more indirect ways, for example, through securitization of loans and backup commitments to securitization vehicles and other capital-markets instruments. Even when banks may not be "special" or unique providers in a particular market, banks have proven themselves to be formidable competitors and innovators--which only reinforces banks' importance in the proper functioning of our financial system. In short, the public's trust and confidence in banking continue to be vital to our financial well-being.  Banks provided considerable credit in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when financial flows were slowed by operational problems. To be sure, banks were able to provide this credit in part because of the huge injection of liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve. But that is a key role for banks in a crisis: to obtain funds--through the discount window or from open market operations, if necessary--and to channel them to those needing funds, based on an assessment of their creditworthiness. Banks' access to the discount window and the payments system, as well as their ongoing relationships with customers and their credit-evaluation skills, allow them to play this role. During a crisis, those banks that play critical roles in the payments system are especially important. As a result, these banks are expected to be very resilient. Though banks now have a smaller role in transmitting monetary policy, they still help to transmit policy actions by arbitraging between the federal funds market and other money markets.  Conclusion A strong case can be made that banks continue to be special. And because they are special, we, as regulators, will continue to apply high standards to companies seeking a bank charter. We must also continue to examine and supervise banks for safety and soundness. Likewise, it appears that Congress will take a cautious approach when determining what types of companies may own and affiliate with banks.  But banks must also compete in the marketplace. Consequently, we can expect over time to see adjustments in both the direct activities of banks and in the line separating banking and commerce. History is, in some sense, about the drawing, re-evaluation, and re-drawing of lines. As a matter of public policy, changes will trail rather than lead the marketplace, and any changes must be informed by a careful study of both the role we want banks to play in our economy and the needs of the marketplace.  4 BIS Review 20/2006 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with Der Standard, De Standaard, La Tribune, Süddeutsche Zeitung and L'Echo An interview with Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by        Ms Birgit Baumann (Der Standard), Mr Luc Coppens (De Standaard), Ms Isabelle Croizard (La Tribune), Ms Helga Einecke (Süddeutsche Zeitung) and Ms Catherine Mommaerts (L'Echo), published on 15 March 2006. *      *      * After the second ECB rate hike, you repeated that monetary policy was still accommodating. At what level do interest rates become neutral, i.e. when they neither stimulate nor brake economic activity.  When I reported on the decision of the ECB’s Governing Council to raise the interest rates I said that our decision reflected our assessment at that time. It is still our assessment. Our assessment is clear. We did not decide ex ante a series of monthly increases of rates as has been done by other central banks. The Governing Council assesses the risks to price stability and does what is necessary to counter these risks when they increase. We do not refer to the notion of a theoretical “neutral rate”. We refer to our mandate, which is to deliver price stability and be credible in delivering price stability over time. It is what the Treaty calls on us to do and what the people of Europe are very clearly asking us to do. By doing so, we are also contributing to a financial environment which is very favourable to growth and job creation in the euro area. When I say that our monetary policy stance is accommodating, it can be confirmed by a number of observations: we have real short-term interest rates which are very close to zero; nominal short-term interest rates are the lowest in the euro area since the Second World War, for example the German Bundesbank never went lower than 2.5%; there is abundant liquidity in the euro area with monetary aggregates growing twice as fast as the growth in GDP. Businessmen complain that the ECB’s rate hikes came too early and might put the economic recovery of the euro area at risk. How can the ECB cope with that criticism?  What we are doing is what our mandate commands us to do. But our mandate is not at all in contradiction with growth and job creation. I will tell you why: in order to preserve a level of medium and long-term market interest rates that is exceptionally favourable to growth and job creation, we have to solidly anchor inflation expectations at a level that is fully in line with our definition of price stability. We do that precisely by demonstrating to observers, investors, savers and our 313 million fellow citizens of the euro area that we do whatever is necessary to deliver price stability. If we were not credible in doing so, all our medium and long-term market interest rates would be much higher. This is well understood by European and global observers. By delivering price stability we also contribute to reinforcing consumer confidence. We are telling consumers: “look, we are protecting and preserving your present and future purchasing power’’. To sum up, what we are doing, i.e. being faithful to our mandate, allows the present euro area recovery to be sustainable in the medium and long run.  The growth rate of Europe now seems unable to reach its potential. Should the ECB therefore become more than a financial watchdog?  Our present assessment is that the current trend in the growth rate in the euro area is around its potential growth rate, taking into account some volatility in the quarterly figures. We will see whether economic growth will accelerate, or whether we will have to cope with other, new shocks. We are constantly assessing the situation in a pragmatic way, based on the facts and the new information that we receive. Let me add something which is important: a good monetary policy is a necessary condition for growth and job creation, but is not sufficient in itself. We also need a sound fiscal policy, bold structural reforms and appropriate monitoring of competitive indicators. This is the responsibility of all the other stakeholders which have a part in the overall result.  The political leaders gave a very sharp reaction to your first rate hike in December, but not to the second in March. Did you convince them in the meantime or how do you explain that?  The ECB is totally and fiercely independent, as you can read in the Treaty on European Union. Its credibility is based upon this independence. That credibility is our most precious asset and permits us BIS Review 20/2006 1 
today to have exceptionally favourable medium and long-term interest rates. I trust that this is increasingly well understood by all our partners in the euro area. Did the recovery in Germany help the ECB Governing Council to decide on the last rate hike?  As you know, we look at the situation of the euro area as a whole. The significantly positive signals in various German surveys are important, because Germany is the largest national economy of the euro area. We will see how the present period of recovery develops. We have quite a number of good signals. These signals are encouraging for the euro area and confirm a trend for the recovery that is likely to be around our growth potential. That said, we are very pragmatic. We look at all the facts, figures and data, and stand ready to incorporate them in our future assessment.  What risks to price stability do you see, with the exception of oil prices?  We see a number of risks. Some of them are associated with the increasing prices of oil and commodities. These increases are progressively incorporated in the prices of other goods and services that are energy intensive. We have another set of risks, which are associated with indirect taxes and increases in administered prices. Furthermore, we have the risk of “second round” effects. This means that economic agents may incorporate in their price setting the wrong assumption that the higher headline inflation due to oil price increases will last in the medium and long run. These risks of “second round” effects are particularly significant as regards wages and salaries. We are there precisely to ensure price stability in the medium term. To date, we have not seen these risks materialise, but we have to prevent them. Once the second round effects materialise, it is too late. Signals for risks in the medium to long term can be deducted from our monetary analysis. For example, loans to the private sector are growing quite rapidly.  You said you are not committed to a series of rate hikes, but two hikes do not make a cycle. Can we expect a scenario similar to that from 1999 to 2000, with seven rate hikes in a row?  We have not decided ex ante a series of rate hikes. It is important to convey this message, because otherwise observers might think that we have decided to raise rates at every meeting, as has been done by another important central bank. At the same time, I said that we never embark on any pre-commitment – we will do what is necessary to counter the risks that we identify. That is why we increased rates in December, why we did not in January and February, and why we did increase rates in March. I don’t want to say anything else. One thing is for sure: all observers have understood that we did not decide a priori to increase rates and that we will do what is necessary to ensure price stability. And they trust us. This trust is perhaps our most precious asset. Can we today speak of a housing market bubble in the euro area?  The development of loans for financing housing forms part of the information which we receive from the monetary analysis and which we monitor closely. If you take the full body of the whole euro area you have a level of outstanding credit for housing which is very dynamic, exceeding 11% growth on a yearly basis. That figure is posted despite the fact that the German real estate market remains depressed. That means that, in part of the euro area, there is an even more rapid development of the situation. So it calls for very close monitoring. At this stage, I will sum up our present understanding of the situation: it is something that is important to monitor closely. It was naturally part of the information we took into account when we decided to increase rates during our last meeting. But I would also add that, at the level of the euro area as a whole, all economies taken into account, I wouldn’t say that we are presently alarmed, diagnosing the immediate danger of a bubble. I would say that we have information that calls for very close monitoring and we will continue to follow these developments very carefully. But you have some differences between countries. How can you cope with that?  Again, at the level of the Governing Council of the ECB we have only one instrument, which is the single monetary policy. If there are situations that are different from country to country, as is the case, other instruments, in particular at national levels, are in the hands of the governments, the parliaments and, in some cases, the national central banks of the countries concerned. However, it is clear that, as far as we are concerned, in that domain, as well as in others, we only have the single monetary policy as an instrument.  What is your appraisal of the seven years since the euro was launched? When do you think it best played its role as a monetary shield?  2 BIS Review 20/2006 
The euro has been an incredible success. Human nature is such that when you have a big success, you tend to forget it. The success has been such that we have been able to deliver to 313 million people the level of monetary confidence, of monetary credibility, of low medium and long-term market interest rates that previously were the privilege of only part of the euro area. All that was considered by many impossible “ex ante”. I have participated in the run up to the euro and I have a very vivid memory of what many observers believed even in 1997 or 1998: the fact that we could succeed in benchmarking the euro on the most credible currencies of the euro area was considered as a quasi impossible endeavour. We succeeded and we met the promise which was made by all the authorities, including central banks, to the people that the euro could be as good, as solid and as credible a currency as their previous national currencies. I am proud, as was my predecessor Wim Duisenberg, to be able to go to all the countries in the euro area and tell people: “you have a currency which has fulfilled the promise that was made”. The launch of the euro was supposed to accelerate the process of economic union and fiscal harmonisation. How do you explain the lack of progress and, worse, the apparent rejection of the euro by many of the larger new Member States of the European Union?  Let me remind you of some figures. Today, 25 countries are members of the EU and, quite soon, there will be 27. Of these 25 countries, only two have an “opt out” clause as regards the euro. In the future, 25 out of the 27 countries will not have an “opt out” clause. And out of the two economies that have an opt out clause – the UK and Denmark – Denmark follows very closely the monetary policy of the euro area. Now let me give you some figures on the Exchange Rate Mechanism 2. When I first arrived at the head of the ECB, there was just one participating currency, the Danish krone. Now, the number of participating currencies is eight. I do not observe a frozen situation, quite the contrary. The euro has facilitated the completion of the single market and is also pushing in the direction of structural reforms that are a major endeavour for Europeans in general. It does not mean that we are fully satisfied with the present situation. It is clear that in the domain of structural reforms, we have to do more, much more. We gave our strong backing to the initiatives taken recently by the European Commission, under the leadership of Mr Barroso, to re-launch the Lisbon Agenda.  If you look at those countries that have implemented well and fully their structural reforms, you see that they are success stories. Ireland, in particular, is a remarkable success story, as regards full employment and GDP per capita. Denmark, which is de facto in the euro area, has made structural reforms in the labour market, which have proved very efficient. We are fully backing this trend of reforms. It is very important to communicate as efficiently as possible and to convince public opinion that this is a successful way to fight unemployment and promote growth. Part of the needed structural reforms are sector-based and imply cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Are you completely discouraged, for example, by the French government’s recent attitude in the Suez-Gaz de France case and Dominique de Villepin’s call for economic patriotism?  The ECB’s Governing Council didn’t discuss any particular dossier relating to cross-border mergers and acquisitions. In the past, the Governing Council always referred to the full completion of the European single market. As a matter of principle, the Governing Council thinks that there is an opportunity cost associated with the non-completion of the single market. Let’s not forget that it is not a new endeavour. The Single Act launched the endeavour for a single market in the mid-1980s. In 1958, when the Treaty of Rome was ratified, the idea was to produce a common market of the size of the USA to benefit from economies of scale. The ambition was already clear 50 years ago: free circulation of men and women, goods and services and capital in the European Union.  Austrian Finance Minister Karl-Heinz Grasser, who is chair of ECOFIN during the first half of 2006, claims that all EU Member States should achieve balanced budgets by 2010, what do you think about that?  It is a good goal. We have always called for the rigorous implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. You will remember that there were calls to drastically change the rules in this domain, and even by some to abandon the pact. We have always said that the Pact is a crucial element in the EMU. The Stability and Growth Pact is very much the “E’’ in EMU. We have no federal government, we have no federal budget, but we have a single currency. In order to be coherent, the EMU needs a stability and growth pact. The three percent threshold, which I am proud of having introduced myself in the negotiations, is not only mentioned in the Stability and Growth Pact but is also referred to in the Treaty. I often have to answer the question, whether more than three percent would not be opportune in difficult situations where an economy could use that extra push. That would be the Keynesian BIS Review 20/2006 3 
argument: the more you spend, the more you activate the economy. But besides that argument, there is what economists call the “Ricardian effect’’. David Ricardo rightly stated that the greater the deficit becomes, the more investors and consumers alike start to realise that such a deficit is not sustainable in the longer run. Somebody will have to pay for it, either through higher market interest rates or through tax increases. Entrepreneurs become nervous and slow down their investments, consumers start saving more and spending less. So the economy slows down and jobs are lost. The more the budget goes into the red, the stronger this Ricardian effect becomes, and the more it outweighs the Keynesian arguments for deficit spending. That is why the stability pact is also a growth pact. Slovenia is the only new EU Member State that is ready for the euro. Do you think it can join in 2007 as expected?  We will see. I don’t want to anticipate the result of the reports that the ECB and the Commission will publish in May. We have to check whether the criteria stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty are fulfilled on a sustainable basis. After seven years, do you have any arguments left to convince the British to join the euro ?  It is up to the British people to decide. As you know, in the past, the British Prime Minister said very clearly that it is in the interest of Britain to join when the time comes. I’m also convinced of this. When you compare Britain and Ireland, you can see that there are good arguments. However, even without the UK, we number 313 million people in the euro area. With Otmar Issing’s departure, the last pioneer of the first ECB-Management is leaving. What has been done in your institution in the last eight years and what challenges lie ahead of you?  Otmar Issing has been and is a marvellous member of the Executive Board. Our institution, the ECB, has been designed to be credible over time irrespective of staff changes. The ECB is credible according to all the information we extract from observers, market participants and the financial sphere. The successive members of the Executive Board are themselves part of the continuity of the institution. I am confident that this trust is solidly based.  Do you think Lucas Papademos would be a marvellous successor to Otmar Issing as Chief Economist?  We will take together, the six of us, the decision for the responsibilities in the Executive Board, when time comes, with our new colleague.  The Federal Reserve System has a new Chairman, Ben Bernanke. What kind of man is he and do you expect to have the same relationship with him as you had with his predecessor, Alan Greenspan?  It is very important that we have a very close relationship with the Federal Reserve System. It has been the case consistently over the past years. At the time of the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, I mentioned several times that we had an exceptional and confident real-time dialogue with the Federal Reserve System, which permitted us to take the appropriate decisions as regards the potential liquidity risks that existed in both the euro and the dollar on our side of the Atlantic. That kind of immediate decision on the very afternoon of the terrorist attacks was possible only because the degree of mutual confidence and companionship between us is very high. I had a very good relationship with Alan Greenspan. We met very often because the various “G’s” (G10, G7, G20) meet regularly. We have a special brotherhood of central banks which is important. I have myself the privilege of presently being Chairman of the G10 and I am the direct witness of this very close and confident relationship between central bankers. Ben Bernanke’s appointment has been extraordinarily well received by the global community, all observers and market participants. I have full confidence that we’ll continue to have the very same, very close and friendly relationship with the Federal Reserve System. Do you think that the Federal Reserve System and Congress are ready to seriously discuss the opportunity of having an inflation target?  The fact that the question has been mentioned with the main argument that it could help to anchor inflation expectations is an idea that we like, as you know. But I don’t want to comment in any respect on decisions that are of the responsibility of the Federal Reserve System’s Open Market Committee and of its Chairman, Ben Bernanke. 4 BIS Review 20/2006 
John Hurley: Monetary policy and prospects for the European economy Speech by Mr John Hurley, Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, to the luncheon meeting of EU Heads of Missions at the French Embassy, Dublin, 9 March 2006. *      *      * Introduction I welcome the opportunity to talk to you today and thank Ambassador Grasset for inviting me. High level gatherings such as this, where we have an opportunity to exchange views freely on important European issues, are invaluable and I look forward to hearing your views later. In my brief address, I will touch on the following issues: the experience in relation to economic growth and inflation developments in the euro area, the recent decisions of the Governing Council in relation to interest rates, some of the risks the euro area economy faces going forward and developments in EU countries outside of the euro area. Economic developments I would like to begin by talking about euro area economic performance and prospects. After many years of disappointment, during which economic recovery proved weak and hesitant, the signs are becoming more encouraging. Economic activity in the euro area is improving and the growth outlook, while still far from vigorous, is more favourable than it has been for some time. Why did economic recovery previously disappoint and why has it now apparently picked up? These are questions which I will now turn to address and, in doing so, shed some light on some of the factors which have shaped the monetary policy environment in recent years. Looking back, the euro area has been slow to participate in the global economic recovery that has, more or less, been ongoing since the middle of 2003. Until recently, the recovery in activity in the euro area, following the protracted period of slow growth between mid-2001 to mid-2003, has been relatively weak compared with the experience of recovery periods in past decades. Up until now, euro area growth ebbed and flowed and the recovery did not evolve in the smooth and sustained fashion that would be usual for this stage of the economic cycle. A number of factors account for the sluggish nature of the recovery until recently. First, unlike earlier episodes, the current recovery evolved against a background of sharply rising energy prices and a significant appreciation of the euro. While the impact of rising oil prices on activity has been more muted than has typically been the case in the past, higher oil prices have heightened uncertainty and acted as something of a headwind against a recovery that has lacked any great momentum. A second problem has been the disappointing performance of consumer spending. There is no doubt that there has been much to hold consumption back. Employment and wage growth have been modest. High and volatile oil prices have had a dampening influence. In addition, savings levels have remained high, reflecting concerns, not only in relation to labour markets, but also about longer-term prospects for health-care and pension systems. Thirdly, until recently, the corporate sector in the euro area has been engaged in a period of balance sheet restructuring, in response to the sharp rise in corporate debt which occurred as part of the late 1990s dotcom boom. A further problem has been the existence of significant structural rigidities in euro area labour and product markets, which are seen by many as holding back growth in the euro area economy.  Not surprisingly, given this background, economic recovery in the euro area was slow to take off in recent years. The problem was that the normal sequence of recovery, which tends to run, first, from a pick up in export growth, then to a recovery in investment and, finally, on to a strengthening of consumer spending, was not operating. While the external engine was firing strongly, the domestic engine was not. More recently, however, developments have become more encouraging. Following four quarters of moderate growth between mid-2004 and mid-2005, there are signs that euro area growth is gathering some momentum. While quarterly growth rates were somewhat volatile in the second-half of last year, looking through these short-term fluctuations, the evidence suggests that economic activity is improving. Of course, external trade continues to provide significant impetus to growth in the euro area. However, there are now also some signs of an improvement in domestic demand. Business confidence has strengthened significantly since last Summer, contributing to a BIS Review 19/2006 1 
welcome recovery in investment. The improvement in investment reflects not only the favourable external stimulus, but also the impact of improved business balance sheets and efficiencies, as well as rising profitability. However, progress remains slow in relation to consumer spending – the main element of domestic demand. While consumer confidence has picked up in recent months, consumer spending growth remains subdued, though there are one or two signs of improvement. Looking ahead, the view of the Governing Council is that the conditions remain in place for ongoing economic expansion in the euro area. A favourable external environment should continue to provide support for exports. Investment should also benefit from what are still very favourable financing conditions, improved business balance sheets and gains in corporate earnings. On the consumer side, spending is likely to grow more gradually and broadly in line with developments in incomes. The recent ECB staff macroeconomic projections point to a somewhat improved growth outlook for this year and next as compared to the past two years. Taking mid-points of the ranges, the projections foresee economic growth of around 2 per cent in both 2006 and 2007, as compared with 1.4 per cent last year. While it has taken time, slowly the euro area economy is returning towards its trend growth rate. Inflation developments Having spoken about activity developments, I will now turn to talk about inflation developments and prospects, before moving on to talk about monetary policy. The headline rate of inflation (HICP) in the euro area has remained just above 2 per cent in recent years, mainly as a result of the strong increases in energy prices and, to a lesser extent, rises in administered prices and taxes. However, underlying domestic inflationary pressures have been relatively subdued and, overall, the pass-through of past oil price increases to consumer prices has been limited. The subdued growth in domestic demand in recent years helps explain the limited ability of producers to pass-on increases in input costs to consumers. Another important factor in this respect has been moderate wage growth, which, in turn, has reflected the subdued nature of labour markets. It was against this background that the Governing Council was able to keep interest rates unchanged at historically low levels for two and one-half years between June 2003 and December 2005. Maintaining price stability – monetary policy decisions Why then, you might ask, given this background, has the Governing Council twice raised interest rates in the past three months? The answer lies in the gradual upward creep of inflation risks. In the course of 2005, inflation projections were progressively revised upwards, mainly, though not exclusively, reflecting stronger than expected increases in oil prices. Reflecting this, as the year progressed, upside risks to the maintenance of medium-term price stability were viewed to be gradually increasing. This assessment was reinforced by the evidence of the monetary analysis, which pointed to strong monetary growth, ample liquidity and rapid expansion of credit – especially consumer credit, notably for housing. By the end of 2005, the evidence from both the economic and monetary perspectives was that an adjustment of the very accommodative stance of the ECB’s monetary policy was warranted. Therefore, on 1 December last, the Governing Council decided to increase interest by 25 basis points. With risks to the outlook for inflation remaining on the upside in the early months of 2006 and the latest staff projections suggesting that, at unchanged interest rates, HICP inflation would probably remain above 2 per cent both this year and next, a further increase in interest rates was recently deemed to be warranted. With respect to these two decisions, I would strongly emphasise a few points. In raising interest rates, on each occasion, the Governing Council was responding to the risks to price stability as it perceived them. As President Trichet has stated emphatically, the Governing Council has not taken any ‘ex ante’ decision to engage mechanically in a series of interest rate increases. I would emphasise that the Governing Council does not pre-commit unconditionally to any future action. Our approach is to consider the most up-to-date information and analysis of the economic and monetary situation and prospects and to act accordingly. I would also emphasise that the Governing Council stands ready to do whatever is necessary to ensure the maintenance of price stability and will act to anchor medium to long-term inflation expectations. The smooth reaction to the recent interest rate increases suggests that markets understand our underlying rationale.  2 BIS Review 19/2006 
Ongoing risks I would like to turn now and make a few brief remarks on the main risks to the outlook for growth and inflation which lie ahead. I will begin with oil prices. Not only do high and volatile oil prices threaten to slow growth, they also raise the risk of higher inflation and it is essential to ensure that second-round effects on wage and price-setting behaviour are avoided. In the longer term, it is difficult to say how the price of oil might evolve. However, recent oil price strength would appear to reflect the combination of strong demand, lack of spare production capacity and uncertainties surrounding supply. This makes it likely that higher oil prices will persist for some time yet and there is an ongoing risk that oil prices could rise further and potentially combine with other negative factors to cause more protracted problems for the global and euro area economies. Oil prices are not the only external factor complicating the outlook. There are also the risks posed by widening global current account imbalances, which show no signs of abating. The seemingly ever-increasing US current deficit implies the potential for significant volatility in foreign exchange markets and this continues to be one of the most important downside risks to growth.  There are also risks from within. In particular, reflecting the stimulative effect of low interest rates on the monetary aggregates, we have seen persistently strong growth in money and credit. This points to potential risks to price stability in the medium to long-term. We are mindful of these risks and we will continue to monitor these developments closely. Another internal issue is fiscal policy. While we have gone through a difficult period, we now have a revised Stability and Growth Pact with a better economic rationale, but with a degree of flexibility that could be misused. With economic growth and prospects improving, countries with excessive deficits need to use the “good times” to make progress towards sound public finances (i.e. maintaining or attaining budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus) by setting sound consolidation plans. These consolidation efforts will be more effective if they are part of a comprehensive reform programme, which includes setting out concrete measures needed to prepare for the long-term fiscal challenges.  Developments outside the euro area Finally, I would like to say a few words about developments in non-euro area EU countries. Enlargement of the European Union was a truly historic event and all the more so having occurred so smoothly. The economies of the new member states have benefited greatly from accession and continue to converge towards the rest of the EU at an impressive pace. Crucially, this is being driven by strong growth in productivity, a reflection of extensive structural reforms. This supports strong growth in exports, underpins capital inflows and allows wages to increase quite robustly without giving rise to inflationary pressures. As a result, inflation rates have generally declined or remained moderate, even after long periods of sustained economic growth and sharp increases in oil prices, though inflationary pressures have become evident in a couple of cases. Central banks in the new member states deserve a good deal of credit for managing inflation expectations effectively but this should not disguise the difficulties that they face, as overheating is an ever-present threat. Fiscal policies, on the other hand, could do more in some instances to stem domestic economic pressures, notwithstanding the need to modernise public infrastructure. Current account deficits are generally high but I would see this largely as a reflection of the convergence process. In a few cases, however, some moderation in import demand would be welcome.  The main exchange rate developments have been the entry of seven currencies into ERM II over the past two years. A high degree of exchange rate stability has been achieved, with all currencies trading either close to or at their central rates against the euro. This has facilitated the convergence process by allowing interest rates to decline while, at the same time, helping to anchor inflation expectations. Furthermore, it has been proven that inflation targeting can be fully consistent with membership of ERM II once economies are sufficiently flexible and policies are largely supportive. There are a couple of instances, however, where inflation rates have risen sharply. I would reiterate the importance of fiscal policy in this regard and point out in particular the fiscal stance should not add to demand pressures when the economy is already growing rapidly. Otherwise, the twin objectives of exchange rate stability and price stability could come into conflict.  The new EU member states have made considerable strides along the path towards membership of the euro area and it is clear that the euro area will expand sooner rather than later. I would not like to comment on the likely outcome of convergence examinations in advance of upcoming Convergence BIS Review 19/2006 3 
Reports from the European Central Bank and the European Commission. However, it is worth reiterating that the Eurosystem is committed to according each country equal treatment with those that have gone before. At the same time, there is no single path towards euro adoption and each country has to be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Assuming that the criteria are satisfied and the conditions met, I look forward to the expansion of the euro area, not least to maximise the benefits of the single European market for all EU citizens. Concluding remarks In conclusion, for both the euro area and the EU, we live in challenging and changing times. However, there are also many opportunities; these must be exploited to the fullest extent, in order to further the living standards of all citizens. In the euro area, for the first time in a long time, we appear to be seeing a sustainable economic recovery emerging. This is a very welcome development and we in the Governing Council will ensure that the recovery takes place in an environment of price stability. In the wider EU, the process of monetary integration is set to continue. As a euro area country, I can assure you that we will be glad to see new members joining when they are ready to do so and have met the conditions for membership. Thank you for your attention. 4 BIS Review 19/2006 
Y V Reddy: Financial sector reform and financial stability Speech by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 8th Global Conference of Actuaries, Mumbai, 10 March 2006. *      *      * Mr. President and distinguished friends, It is a privilege and an honour to be invited for this 8th Global Conference of Actuaries. Dr. R. Kannan has been a respected colleague of mine for several years in the Reserve Bank and I am thankful to him for persuading me to join you. Also, Mr. C.S. Rao, Chairman, IRDA and Mr. D. Swarup, PFRDA have been my friends and colleagues in the Government of Andhra Pradesh and Government of India. Financial sector reform and financial stability are subjects of high priority to central bankers, are of relevance to all financial regulators and may be of interest to a gathering of finance professionals like actuaries. My address will, therefore, focus on the features of the financial sector reforms in India; the initiatives taken to assure financial stability; the links between reforms and stability in the financial sector and conclude with some observations in the current context.  Financial sector reform The financial sector reforms in India, like almost all other countries, have some common and a few unique features. They were undertaken early in the reform cycle, in early 1990s. They were designed by eminent professionals in the country, and implemented pragmatically. This is evident from the dynamic mix between public and private ownership and transition of Development Financial Institutions as well as Unit Trust of India into their new incarnations. Fiscal support has not been burdensome and legacy problems such as non-performing loans have been absorbed by banks and not transferred to fisc. New regulatory bodies such as those for securities markets, insurance and pension funds have been legislated or are underway. While prudential regulation of banks has been in vogue for decades, independent regulatory framework for other entities has been a recent phenomenon. Enhanced competition has been induced with the entry of private foreign entities and foreign capital in financial sector. In brief, there has been progress in the three inter-related pillars of financial sector, namely ownership, regulation and competition. Let me illustrate the pragmatic nature of reforms in the fiscal-monetary policy interface. Reserve Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to limit the issuance of ad hoc Treasury Bills to the central government and terminate automatic monetisation of the government’s financial needs in 1994 and 1997, respectively.The Reserve Bank avoided participation in the primary issues in recent years except to prepay external debt or as a transition measure, last week. These de facto arrangements, proven to be workable, are coming into effect through legislative sanction only on April 1, 2006. Financial stability Financial Stability is difficult to define and thus difficult to measure. Basically, it refers to the smooth functioning of the financial markets and institutions but it does not mean absence or avoidance of crisis but presence of conditions conducive to efficient functioning without serious disruption. The relevant legal, institutional and policy frameworks are wide ranging and policy instruments at the disposal of authorities very varied. In a way, the financial stability objective is shared with a set of public policy bodies and professional bodies like auditors and actuaries but the primary responsibility for overall financial sector efficiency and stability generally rests with the central bank. The plausible reasons for such a responsibility are the major elements contributing to financial stability, namely, the oversight of the financial infrastructure, in particular payments systems; regulation and supervision of financial institutions; crisis management and provision of liquidity; and macro financial stability encompassing monitoring not only the behaviour of all important players in the financial sector but also non-financial sector balance sheets as well as that of the governments. BIS Review 19/2006 1 
Financial sector reforms and stability National authorities have typically adapted the design of financial sector reforms - the pace, sequencing direction and ambit - to country-specific situations, mindful of the threats to financial stability. The relevant considerations may be summarized here. First, there is substantial consensus, backed by some historical and cross-country evidence, that there are strong complementarities between financial stability and macroeconomic stability. Second, a key issue in the design of financial sector reforms is the pace of reforms in the context of ensuring financial stability. Opinion remains sharply divided over the choice between a big-bang approach or shock therapy and a cautious or gradualist strategy. On balance, it appears, the reforms need to be introduced more as a process than as a short-lived event while the process moves fast enough to produce reasonable results without running the risk of disruption in the short run. Third, in case the gradualist approach is adopted, the question that arises is what should be the optimal sequencing of reforms which secures financial stability. Such sequencing is crucial for ensuring inter-sectoral balances and avoiding the chances of disproportionality. Fourth, no reform process, however, paced and sequenced, can be consistent with financial stability if it is widely perceived as temporary and lacking credibility. In a market-based environment, the expectations of the economic agents are extremely important for economic decisions. The reform process can succeed only if the economic agents, especially investors, believe that the reforms are enduring. The issue of credibility is inter-related with the choice of the pace of reform. Our experience has been that a graduated pace wins credibility since it avoids disruptions and roll-backs in the short run while at the same time allowing the beneficiaries to build a consensus in favour of continuing reforms. A key issue is that of managing expectations. There is reason to believe that the financial reforms process in India has greatly aided in strengthening and reinforcing financial stability. The financial sector has acquired the strength to absorb shocks, largely facilitated by regulatory actions. The financial system is now robust and resilient, contributing to public confidence and overall stability. At this stage, the optimism generated by impressive macroeconomic performance and the modest success in implementing financial sector reforms has intensified pressures for significantly accelerating the pace of external financial liberalisation. It is essential to take into account the risks associated with it while resetting an accelerated pace of a gradualist approach. It needs to be emphasized that the existing international financial architecture is not adequate to prevent or mitigate the domestic and external effects of a financial crisis in large economies like India. The impact of instability in times of crisis appears largely to be borne by the home or domestic public sector rather than the global private sector. The issue of setting the pace of financial liberalisation revisits the issue of trade-off between sustained growth and a growth rate that could potentially turn volatile and unstable. While it is necessary to add to the pace of growth, it is also equally important to minimize the risks of instability, and the experience shows that more than desirable pace of financial liberalisation was often followed by financial instability and crises. Avoiding crises is ultimately a national responsibility. The approach to managing the financial sector, the choice of instruments and the timing and sequencing of policies are matters of informed judgment, given the imponderables.    Current context Some thoughts on the issue of financial stability in the current context, are perhaps in order.  Low growth accompanied by high inflation is a nightmare for a central banker.  High growth coupled with low inflation is indeed a central banker's dream.  I have reason to be happy, considering the growth and inflation numbers in India now.  So are all my brother or sister central bankers who seem to have similar positive trends. However, currently almost every central banker in this globalised world keeps wondering whether the night ahead will continue the dream run and if so, when will it run out of steam.  The concerns of central bankers today arise out of what has been described as stable disequilibrium - with every day adding to potential disequilibrium while continuing to be stable.  The perceived risks arise mainly out of global imbalances and outlook for oil prices, particularly in the light of emerging geo-political situation.  Most market participants seem to sense these risks but this sentiment does not appear to be reflected in the pricing of risks. Risks do not disappear but they get transferred to another part of the system. The macro policies in emerging markets in particular have to factor in these risks while continuously balancing financial sector reform and stability considerations. More important, for 2 BIS Review 19/2006 
the regulators, monitoring where the risk lies has become very difficult due to emergence of large conglomerates, sophisticated market instruments such as derivatives and presence of players like hedge funds.  The good news is that there is international cooperation among central bankers to mitigate the impact of such risks. The Actuaries can certainly help the process of analysing the risks in insurance sectors that do affect a large segment of population that in fact seeks to minimize such risks through insurance. Let me conclude by thanking the organisers for provoking me to think aloud and share my thoughts on a subject of common interest to all of us assembled here. I wish the conference fruitful deliberations, well balanced by pleasant stay and memories.  BIS Review 19/2006 3 
Timothy F Geithner: US monetary policy in the global financial environment Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Japan Society Corporate Luncheon, New York City, 9 March 2006. I would like to thank Margaret McConnell of the Bank’s Research and Statistics Group for valuable contributions to this speech. *      *      * We are in the midst of another wave of global economic and financial integration. This movement toward greater openness and the associated rise in capital mobility offers the prospect of substantial economic gains for the U.S. and the global economy. Stronger real and financial linkages across nations have the potential to significantly raise the prospects for long-run world growth. The ensuing development of the market sector in emerging market and developing economies offers probably the most powerful means available for raising income growth and living standards in a very large share of the world’s population. These changes, and the complementary advances in technology, offer the prospect of more productive and stable real economies. The increase in the ties between national financial systems, the greater sophistication of financial markets and financial market instruments and the increase in capital flows across borders, allow risks to be shared more broadly and capital to flow to where the returns are highest, also contributing to stronger and more stable future economic growth. This process of integration has, of course, a range of implications for policymakers. Many of these implications are positive, for the benefits of integration over time are powerful and compelling for all economies. In important ways, economic integration may have made the principal job of central banks easier, by contributing to productivity growth and reducing some sources of inflation pressure, at least during the transition when a large share of the working age population of the world is being brought into the market. But the process of change in how economies and financial markets interact also complicates the task of central banks. Our understanding of the how these changes affect our capacity to forecast economic activity and inflation and our ability to assess how monetary policy affects the economy almost certainly lags the changes underway. In my remarks today, I will talk about some of the implications of these challenges for the conduct of monetary policy. I will focus on two features of what is happening in the world economy and financial markets today that are among the most interesting and consequential of the many questions we face today in thinking about the changes in the world economy and the task of central banking. These are, first, the behavior of forward interest rates in financial markets, and, second, the pattern of external imbalances. These features are interesting, in part, because they seem somewhat anomalous, or inconsistent with what the past has led us to expect. They seem likely to be related to each other and both are a feature of the changes underway in global financial integration. Understanding the forces behind these phenomena or anomalies is important to thinking through what they mean for policy. When Alan Greenspan first used the term “conundrum” to describe the surprising behavior of forward interest rates, he was reacting to the decline in forward nominal rates over a period in which the Federal Open Market Committee was raising its federal funds target rate. This behavior of forward rates, the counterpart of which is the behavior of the bond yield curve, looked anomalous both in comparison to observations from past tightening cycles and with what seemed to be strong evidence about the fundamental soundness of the outlook for the real economy. The source of the relatively low level of nominal rates is still a matter of considerable debate. Part of the explanation lies in the decline in expectations of future inflation and uncertainty about future inflation. Part of the explanation may also lie in greater confidence that the secular decline in the variability of economic growth observed over the past two decades in the United States is likely to continue. However, even with the information provided by the development of the market for inflation-indexed government securities, we have less ability than we would like to draw conclusions about what any nominal forward rate means for expectations about the level of future real rates, uncertainty about future real rates, and what those might imply about expectations about future economic activity. This uncertainty makes it harder to assess the appropriate path of monetary policy. BIS Review 18/2006 1 
The other surprising feature of the current economic environment is the pattern of global imbalances, and the size and persistence of the U.S. current account deficit. As Alan Greenspan has explained, the greater dispersion in external imbalances can be seen as the inevitable result of fundamentally healthy changes in the world economy. As the world progresses toward increasingly integrated financial and goods markets, other things being equal, one might expect to see an increase in the number of countries with surpluses or deficits, and potentially larger surpluses and deficits, as flows of both financial assets and goods work to equalize desired saving and investment around the world. If one were confident that observed imbalances simply reflected a more efficient allocation of the world’s stock of saving to its most productive uses, that relative prices adjust freely in response to changing fundamentals and that economies are flexible and agile in adapting to those changes, then we might also reasonably expect these imbalances to resolve themselves through smooth and gradual adjustments in relative prices and flows of goods and services. These conditions do not fully exist today. We do not yet live in a world of perfect capital mobility, one in which savings move across borders to their most productive use without constraint in the form of capital controls or without distortions affecting the behavior of private actors. Recognizing this is important to understanding both why the U.S. imbalance has grown as large as it has and, perhaps, more importantly why it has been financed with such apparent ease despite obvious concerns about its sustainability. If the U.S. external deficit continues to run at a level close to 7 percent of GDP—and most forecasts assume it will for some time, then the net international investment position of the United States will deteriorate sharply, U.S. net obligations to the rest of the world will rise to a very substantial share of GDP, and a growing share of U.S. income will have to go to service those obligations. The anomaly is that these imbalances have persisted on a seemly unsustainable path with relatively low interest rates and very little evidence of rising risk premia. Economists have invested quite a bit of effort over the past two years in exploring alternative explanations for the coexistence of these phenomena, and their potential implications for policy. Much of the focus has been on looking at the forces behind the current pattern of global capital flows and how those forces might evolve over time. The size of external imbalances, the capital flows associated with them, and the accompanying constellation of interest rates and exchanges rates reflect a range of factors, from differences in actual and potential growth rates, and the degree of competition in financial and product markets and the presence or absence of capital controls, to differences in monetary and exchange rate arrangements, the degree of financial market development, and the net borrowing requirements of governments, and to a whole range of different factors that affect savings preferences and the perceived return on private investment. The relative importance of these factors is hard to assess, as is their likely persistence. And this complicates the task of understanding the implications for policy. The challenge of explaining these anomalies is illustrated by considering some of the explanations now prevailing. The decline of thrift in the United States is one common explanation. The sustained decline in net national savings in the United States is the necessary counterpart to the rise in the current account deficit. But this observation does not explain why that growth has not been accompanied by an increase in longer-term interest rates. The robust productivity outlook for the United States relative to the rest of the world is consistent with an increase in the U.S. current account deficit, such as we experienced in the late 1990s. If this gap in potential growth were sustained, the United States would be able to sustain a larger external imbalance than we might have thought historically would be the case. But the present magnitude of the U.S. external imbalance seems difficult to reconcile with plausible estimates of future productivity and potential output growth. The demographic shifts underway in the major economies seem to have contributed to an increase in demand for longer-dated fixed income assets to fund growing pension liabilities, and these shifts have been reinforced by actual and anticipated changes in the regulations that affect pension fund managers. These changes may have operated to push up the price and lower the yield on longer maturity bonds, but the effect of these changes seems likely to be small in comparison to the changes in the behavior of forward interest rates. The rise in the current account surplus that is the counterpart to the U.S. deficit has focused much attention on the rise in measured savings relative to investment that has emerged in many economies. But the implications of this are ambiguous. If the rise in so-called excess savings principally reflected 2 BIS Review 18/2006 
concern about future economic opportunities and weak investment demand, then this might imply a decline in future real interest rates. But the pessimism implied by this view is hard to reconcile with the relatively robust pattern of investment growth, particularly in those countries with some of the larger external surpluses. It is hard to reconcile with the fact that growth in aggregate demand globally has been reasonably strong through this recent period of relatively low forward interest rates. And it seems somewhat inconsistent with the rise in equity and other asset prices, the fall in credit risk premia, and the relatively low levels of uncertainty about the future reflected in measures of expected future volatility in many different types of financial instruments. One feature of present conditions that is not captured by these explanations and that is likely to be playing a significant role in contributing to the combination of these large imbalances and relatively low forward interest rates is the pattern of exchange rate and monetary policy arrangements in the global economy today. Even with the broad shift globally to more flexible exchange rates, a substantial part of the world economy now run monetary policy regimes targeted at limiting the variability in their exchange rate against the dollar, or a basket in which the dollar plays a substantial role. Sustaining that objective in the past several years has required a large accumulation of dollar assets. The scale of this activity has been particularly dramatic in parts of Asia. The significant rise in the earnings of the energy exporters, many of whom also run exchange rate regimes that seek to shadow the dollar, has also generated a substantial rise in investments in U.S. assets. A large share of the capital flows to the United States that have financed our current account imbalance come from these official sources. These flows add to other sources of private demand for U.S. assets. At the margin, they put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates and upward pressure on other asset prices. Through this effect, the monetary policy regimes that prevail in parts of the world help explain at least part of the persistence of these anomalies. Recognizing that we live in a world where major exchange rates do not move freely against the dollar, means that the dollar is not as flexible as we tend to think. And understanding that the effort to sustain these exchange rate regimes has required more expansionary monetary policy in those countries than would otherwise have been the case helps identify a substantial source of what market participants describe as very ample liquidity in world markets. The size of this effect is difficult to estimate with confidence. The economies that are the source of these flows are in aggregate a substantial part of the world economy, and the collective flows from official sources are probably large enough to have some impact on U.S. interest rates. Research at the Federal Reserve and outside suggests that the scale of foreign official accumulation of U.S. assets has put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates, with estimates of the effect ranging from small to quite significant. What does this mean for policy? Here are several implications. First, this pattern of exchange rate and monetary policy arrangements and the associated scale of official intervention in markets complicate our ability to assess the underlying economic conditions in our economies and to forecast the future path of output and inflation. If the effects of these policies are large enough to alter or distort the relationship between asset prices and the underlying fundamentals in our economies, and this seems likely to be the case, then we can take less comfort from traditional relationships between those variables. The fact that official purchases of financial assets are driven by different factors than those driving private investors suggests that we would probably see a somewhat different combination of capital flows, exchange rates and interest rates in the absence of official intervention. This makes the task of assessing the probable trajectory of growth and inflation more complicated. It makes it harder to assess the likely evolution in financial conditions and asset prices. And it makes it harder to assess the effects of the present stance of monetary policy on aggregate demand and inflation. To the extent that these forces act to raise asset prices, lower interest rates and reduce risk premia, it is harder for the markets to assess how much of the very favorable conditions are likely to reflect fundamentals and prove more durable. This can contribute to an increased willingness to raise leverage in the investment community and to take on more exposure to risk. For the same reason, this phenomenon can act to mask or offset the effects of high levels of present and expected future government borrowing on interest rates, perhaps contributing to a false sense of reassurance that we can continue to run large structural deficits without risk of crowding out private investment and damaging future growth. BIS Review 18/2006 3 
What might this mean for the conduct of monetary policy? To the extent that these forces act to put downward pressure on interest rates and upward pressure on other asset prices, they would contribute to more expansionary financial conditions than would otherwise be the case. And, if all else were equal, which of course is unlikely ever to be the case, monetary policy in the affected countries would have to adjust in response; policy would have to act to offset these effects in order to achieve the same impact on the future path of demand and inflation. To do otherwise would run the risk that monetary policy would be too accommodative, pulling resources from the future in a way that would alter the trajectory for the growth of the capital stock, perhaps amplifying the imbalances, and compromising the price stability. Finally, these aspects of global monetary arrangements and financial conditions have important implications for how we communicate about monetary policy. They strengthen the case for why central banks should be clear about their objectives and credible in their commitment to price stability. They reinforce the case for preserving the flexibility to adjust policy in response to changing conditions. And they underscore the importance of being open about the greater level of uncertainty we face in understanding the forces at work on the trajectory of demand and inflation. Central banks, of course, need to be careful not to convey more certainty about what we know than we reasonably can know. Let me conclude by observing that a constellation of factors has aligned to produce the current combination of low world interest rates, low risk premia and large global imbalances. Most of these factors are outside the control of U.S. monetary policy, and we do not fully understand their implications for our economy and for policy. The process of global economic integration makes it ever more important that we work to improve our understanding of how this complex of global monetary arrangements affects our objectives. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 18/2006 
Yves Mersch: Bridge Forum Dialogue Introduction by Mr Yves Mersch, Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, to the speech by Vaclav Klaus, President of the Czech Republic, at the Bridge Forum Dialogue conference, Luxembourg, 8 March 2006. *      *      * Mr. President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and gentlemen, Dear Friends, In the Bridge Forum Dialogue, we are most honoured to have with us, this evening, as guest speaker the Head of State of the Czech Republic. We, in Luxembourg, have a special place in our hearts for the Czech Republic dating back to the period when the House of Luxembourg and Bohemia were united between 1310 and 1437. Vaclav Klaus is such an eminent figure that it is almost unnecessary to introduce him. So, just a minimum of facts to refresh our memories. His academic field is economics which he studied in Prague, and later, taking advantage of a period of relative liberalization, under Communist rule, in Italy and the United States. Later, he taught economics at the Charles University and the Prague University of Economics. In his political career Mr. Klaus has been, successively, Finance Minister of the former Czechoslovakia and then Prime Minister, Chairman of the Parliament and, since February 2003, President of the Czech Republic. He played a leading role in the "Velvet separation" of the Czech and Slovak Republics. President Klaus has written more than 20 books on political, economic and social themes and has received many prizes and honorary doctorates all over the world. Mr. Klaus has chosen as the title of his speech "Some doubts about the EU’s ever-closer future". He is known to be an excellent, even charismatic, speaker and he is fearless in expounding his own personal vision of Europe. I have studied a number of recent speeches in which Mr. Klaus has set out his vision of Europe. The points I shall make are not aimed at contradicting our distinguished speaker but merely at stimulating the debate. As a small country, Luxembourg is staunchly expressing its confidence in further European integration and is deeply attached to the welfare state. As such but also as a seat of the European institutions, we are following the debate about "our Europe" with great interest and the polls show that people in this spot of Europe are better informed about and more aware of European matters than elsewhere. President Klaus has strong views on Europe and begs to differ from mainstream thinking, but on the European constitution he believes that "a new constitutional document will have to be created". Reading through his most recent publications, it seems to me that President Klaus’s views are anchored in a two-pillar philosophy (like the ECB policy strategy) • the first pillar is the traditional divide between the individual and the collectivity, or the private sphere and the public sphere, and  • the second pillar is the appropriate level at which to deliver public goods, the European level or the national one.  On the first pillar he describes himself "as a conservative economist and politician… reading Mises, Hayek or Friedman and … being their follower and true believer". As such his views have been compared with those of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who also opposed conservative liberalism to mainstream conservative ideas embedded in the idea of a social market economy. President Klaus considers that this latter thinking leads to "a European BIS Review 18/2006 1 
paternalistic, overregulated welfare state" and that "extensive regulation of economic activities has structural similarities with the communist past". He writes that “slow economic growth, high unemployment, loss of competitiveness, the aging of the European population, the crises of pension systems or of health-care systems, the insufficient quality of education, the problem of immigration and multiculturalism all have their roots in this freedom-constraining welfare system. These views are more often reflected among economic observers. Martin Wolf recently wrote in the Financial Times: “There is something rotten in the welfare state of Europe. The time has come for Europeans to ask themselves the unthinkable: can their vaunted social model endure"? Wolf speaks of "the hypertrophy of the state" which is "maternal, protective, but also infantilising: its high taxes and benefits discourage anybody from doing too well, while ensuring that nobody does badly. Its services are available to all, but are also mediocre and inflexible." We are in the trap, Hayek denounced: the view that society can be rationally planned and directed. Our question, as pragmatists, is: Can the system be mended? Is the Lisbon agenda not an appropriate response? Is there no middle ground between the invisible hand that creates very visible wounds and a stifling overregulation unable to deliver growth and jobs? What about the Nordic model combining welfare state and growth? What does history teach us? Is communism not rooted in the excesses of unrestricted economic freedom? How do we best prevent economic, social and even political difficulties in this respect? But the same question is valid for the second pillar of President Klaus’s thinking: what is the appropriate level of public intervention: the nation state or the European level? President Klaus believes in culturally or ethnically homogenous societies as opposed to multiculturalism. Therefore a Parliament can only be legitimate at the level of a nation, which does not exist in Europe. As a consequence supranational institutions are not democratic. “The European preoccupation with Europe is connected with the fact that Europeans were made to believe that the era of nation states is over and that, because of omnipresent externalities and because of artificially built belief in the importance and inevitability of continental-wide public goods, Europe must be unified and therefore organized, constructed, controlled and regulated from above, said Mr. Klaus in a recent visit to India. Giving more power to the European Parliament is an illusion. “Softening the rules and relying on the offer of variable geometry would be a mistake. Such procedures already exist (Euro, Schengen, defense, many temporary exceptions) and have always been something of a ratchet. While the idea of European federalism certainly has followers in every European nation, at the level of decision-makers, the prevalence of nation states seems to be unquestioned in the present perspective. The long-term objectives are more open, and one has to admit that European integration is seen as a dynamic difficult to stop. In a speech "Small countries and Europe – 90 years after Masaryk", you quote Tomas Garregue Masaryk who stressed that "history is a process of integration, but at the same time of disintegration". In a globalised world are there really no common goods that are better delivered at a supranational level? Have education, security, health research, for example, not a European dimension? How can nation states react or accompany economic agents in activities which are less and less linked to the nation state? Is the real debate not better encapsulated in a clearer consensus on subsidiarity? Are the present boundaries in Europe representative of homogenous nation states? What do we do about emerging regionalism? Again, as with the first pillar, what can we learn from the history of our continent which has experienced different models: domination of one nation state over Europe, more or less holy alliances among the biggest, stifling coalitions, anarchy of a myriad of small states etc. The present model, based on fitting together certain areas of policy making, retaining others and giving a proportionally larger say in decision-making to smaller countries is two generations old. Did it serve us well or do we have to roll it back? The chief economist of the London based Centre for European Reform, Katinka Barysch, questions whether in the current political climate, EU member states would be ready to reaffirm their support for the “four freedoms of capital, goods, services and people, which President Klaus strongly endorses. President Klaus, you said your vision is not about closing ourselves in. 2 BIS Review 18/2006 
Is protectionism not the most imminent danger? Barysch argues that "the nature of the single market and competition has changed since enlargement", pointing out that the much wider gulf between high-wage and low-wage countries has fuelled fears among workers in old Europe. President Klaus, few have been able to stimulate our thinking about our socio-economic and political environment in a way you do. You abhor intellectual cosiness. We are eager to listen to you. We have a fascinating evening before us, especially since President Klaus has kindly agreed to reply to questions at the end of his speech. Mr. Klaus, you have the floor. BIS Review 18/2006 3 
Ben S Bernanke: Community banking and community bank supervision in the twenty-first century Remarks by Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Independent Community Bankers of America National Convention and Techworld, Las Vegas, 8 March 2006.  The references for the speech can be found on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s website. *      *      * Good morning. I am pleased to join you today to discuss matters of mutual interest to the Federal Reserve and community banks; to learn more about your business; and, I hope, to meet many of you in person. Community banks have long played a critical role in the U.S. economy, and this is no less true in the twenty-first century. Today, I will begin by making some observations, based in part on research done at the Federal Reserve and elsewhere, about the health of community banks and their evolving role in our economy. Community banks are generally doing quite well, and I expect that good performance to continue. But community banks also face a changing business environment that presents a number of important long-run challenges. In the second portion of my remarks, I will speak a bit about how the Federal Reserve, as the supervisor of many community banks, is also adjusting to a changing environment, and I will review some of the key financial risks facing community banks. Developments in community banking By a wide variety of indicators, the overall performance of community banks in recent years has been quite strong. Average return on equity (ROE), for example, following a decline associated with the 2001 recession, remains solid and indeed has shown a slight upward trend. Return on assets for community banks as a whole demonstrates a similar pattern and has stayed well above traditional benchmarks of strong performance. Net interest margins remain higher than those of the largest banks, and this gap has even widened since 2003. Various measures of loan quality for community banks have been robust, and bank failures have been rare. Equally important, both our on-site examinations and our off-site surveillance system, which uses statistical models to attempt to flag emerging weaknesses at community banks, detect signs of potential problems at very few banks. Consistent with this view, community bank capital ratios remain impressively high, and community banks' ability to attract deposits continues to be a source of strength. One strong indicator of the continued health of community banks is the rate at which new banks continue to be created. For example, if we define a community bank as any bank or thrift organization with total real (2002) assets of a billion dollars or less, slightly more than 700 community banks were formed from the beginning of 2000 through 2005, an average of about 120 per year. Clearly, many people remain willing to invest in the future of community banking. The Board has long taken the view that community banks will remain a vigorous and innovative sector of the economy. I think that forecast remains a good one today. All of this is good news. But I am sure that many in this audience would agree that community banks also face serious challenges. Expansion of the geographic scope of banking activities, rapid technological change in the production of financial services, the increasing importance of nonbank providers, and evolving patterns of economic growth are among the factors that are changing the banking marketplace. And, while many of these changes have improved the efficiency of our financial system and lowered costs for consumers, it is only realistic to acknowledge that they also present new and sometimes daunting tests for community banks.  Indeed, we have seen major shifts in the structure of the U.S. banking industry in recent decades. Under the same definition of community banks that I used a moment ago, the share of banking industry assets held in community banks has fallen from about 20 percent in 1994 to a little more than 12 percent in 2005. In addition, the number of community banks has dropped from more than 10,000 in 1994 to about 7,200 in 2005. Other definitions of community banks and other structural measures, such as the share of total deposits, also show declines in recent years.  BIS Review 17/2006 1 
Most of this consolidation is a result of mergers. A recent study by a member of the Federal Reserve Board staff shows that between 1994 and 2003 there were more than 3,500 bank and thrift mergers (Pilloff, 2004). In about 92 percent of these mergers, the target institution had one billion dollars or less in total assets. Although bank merger activity has generally declined since the late 1990s, at least 200 deals were completed in each year from 2000 through 2005. The evolution of relationship finance These developments notwithstanding, research by our staff and other economists supports the view that community banks continue to play an important role in the provision of financial services, particularly to small businesses, but also to a wide range of retail customers nationwide. Indeed, conventional wisdom in the research community is that "the central principle of community banking is 'relationship finance'" (DeYoung et al., 2004, p. 81). By relationship finance I mean financial services whose value-added depends importantly on the ongoing personal interactions of bankers with their customers, interactions that improve the flow of information and allow for more customized services. Relationship finance strengthens the economy by allowing credit and other financial services to be provided more efficiently.  But recent research also confirms what many community bankers tell us--that traditional notions of relationship finance are changing, along with the nature of community bank-customer relationships. The conventional research paradigm included the idea that small businesses and households tend to be informationally "opaque"; that is, information about these potential borrowers can be costly to obtain and hard to quantify. According to this view, the efficient supply of credit to such parties required close interactions to elicit "soft," or qualitative, information, such as the personal characteristics of the borrower or relevant aspects of local markets and opportunities. This paradigm holds that large banks have a comparative advantage lending to those relatively transparent customers from which they can obtain "hard," or quantitative, information, such as standardized accounting data, and community banks have a comparative advantage lending to relatively opaque small businesses and households.  However, this division of labor between large and small institutions has begun to blur. Today, practitioners and researchers understand that low-cost information processing, improved credit-scoring, and more sophisticated management techniques are rapidly reducing the effective opacity of many small businesses and households. Credit card lending provides an example of this phenomenon. Technological and financial innovation, including credit scoring, securitization, and economies of scale in data processing, have combined to make credit card lending a hard-information, transactions-driven business, quite different from traditional unsecured personal lending, which relies heavily on personal knowledge and relationships.  Some recent data from the Board's forthcoming Survey of Small Business Finances sheds some light on how the marketplace, and the role of community banks, is changing. The Board conducts this survey every five years. Our most recent data, which are still preliminary and will be released later this year, are for year-end 2003; they are the result of interviews with more than 4,200 small businesses that represent an estimated 6.3 million small businesses in the United States. The surveys show that small businesses are heavy users of financial services. For example, the proportion of these businesses using some type of financial service at a bank or thrift rose from 92 percent in 1998 to 96 percent in 2003. Increases occurred across a broad range of financial services and were especially strong in the area of "financial management services," which includes activities such as check clearing, cash management, letters of credit, and credit card processing.  According to the surveys, community banks remain an important provider of these services, albeit in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Among small businesses that reported using a bank or thrift in 2003, about 37 percent used a community bank, down from about 42 percent in 1998. Over the same period, the share of small businesses using a financial service supplied by a nondepository institution rose from 40 percent to 54 percent.  Although these surveys show that community banks face increasing competition, including from nondepository providers, they also highlight the importance of one of the traditional strengths of community banks: local presence. For example, in 2003 the median distance between a small business's headquarters and its bank or thrift was three miles, about the same as in 1998. Indeed, part of the success of nondepository institutions may have been due to the fact that the median distance between a small-business customer and its nondepository service provider fell from 83 miles in 1998 2 BIS Review 17/2006 
to 37 miles in 2003, with most of the change resulting from greater proximity of customers to nondepository loan providers. Being close and convenient is important. Data collected as part of the banking agencies' Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) activities also demonstrate the importance of proximity. As you know, the CRA focuses on banks' lending and services provided within their local communities. From CRA and other data, we can estimate the share of loans to small businesses made by depository institutions located physically within the local market area. These data show that between 1996 (the year we began collecting such data) and 2004, the competition from out-of-market lenders has increased, a result that will not surprise you. However, in value terms, the share of small-business loans made by out-of-market firms did not exceed 18 percent in any year. Small-business owners look overwhelmingly to local lenders for credit. We see that, for community banks, the overall picture is complex. In financial terms, community banks remain quite strong, and there is considerable entry into the business. New technologies and management methods have eroded some of the traditional informational benefits of relationship finance, however, and community banks have lost market share to larger banks and to nondepository institutions. But the data also show that many customers want to be served locally; they value proximity and convenience. In my view, the strong relationships and personalized services provided by community banks remain an important reason for their continuing success.  Supervisory perspectives Like community banks, bank supervisors must also adapt to a changing financial and economic environment. I would like to discuss some of the ways in which the Federal Reserve's supervision of community banks has evolved in recent years and also briefly review some of the key financial risks that we see in our examinations.  In the 1990s, bank supervisors began to take a more proactive, risk-focused approach. Under this approach, examiners focus their on-site reviews on those activities that appear to pose the greatest risks to each individual banking organization, with particular attention to the bank's procedures for evaluating, monitoring, and managing those risks. The objective is to address weaknesses in management and internal controls before, rather than after, financial performance suffers. In adapting to change, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have also consistently kept in view the competitive pressures that community banks face, pressures that make the costs of regulation an important concern. Whenever possible, we have streamlined procedures and worked to eliminate unnecessary burden. For example, based on industry feedback and supervisory experience, the Federal Reserve recently modified its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement to raise the asset size used to define eligible companies from $150 million to $500 million. These revisions address changes in the industry and in the economy since the initial issuance of the policy statement in 1980. While the bank holding companies (BHCs) affected hold only 6 percent of total BHC assets, this change increases the exempt group to roughly 85 percent of all BHCs, thereby providing some burden relief to many smaller companies. These companies will be exempt from consolidated risk-based capital guidelines and will be allowed to file abbreviated semiannual reports in place of consolidated quarterly financial statements. Under the policy statement, the exemption would not be extended to holding companies with significant nonbank or off-balance-sheet activities or that have material amounts of public debt or equity securities outstanding. Of course, we and the other banking agencies will vigorously enforce prudential capital standards for all deposit-taking institutions, including those owned by the exempt BHCs.  Supervisors have sought to adjust regulatory procedures to account for the needs of community banking organizations in other ways. As you are no doubt aware, in tandem with the review of capital standards for the largest banks, known as Basel II, the federal banking agencies are taking a comprehensive look at additional possible changes to existing regulatory capital guidelines for banks that would not adopt the proposed Basel II revisions. These possible changes to Basel I would seek to increase the risk sensitivity of the framework and to help mitigate any competitive inequities that could result from the implementation of Basel II.  The recent update to the CRA regulations provides another example in which regulators have taken into account the special features of community banks. Last year, the Federal Reserve and other federal agencies issued final CRA rules that reduced compliance burden by creating a new category of intermediate small banks with assets between $250 million and $1 billion. Banks in this new category now face reduced requirements for data collection and reporting, and they have become eligible for a BIS Review 17/2006 3 
two-pronged set of CRA tests--a streamlined lending test and a community development test--rather than the three-part CRA criteria that larger banks must meet. These changes are intended to reduce the costs borne by smaller banks and to increase flexibility while still achieving the community development objectives of CRA. To target examination resources and to limit the burden of on-site reviews, the Federal Reserve also has increasingly relied on automated off-site monitoring tools. For example, since the late 1990s, the Federal Reserve has supervised many small bank holding companies using an off-site review program. We support this program with a targeted monitoring system that seeks to identify parent company and nonbank issues that may adversely affect affiliated insured depository institutions. This program enables us to limit on-site reviews to those bank holding companies with characteristics that could pose risks to insured depositories. We also use statistical models to monitor the condition of state member banks and quickly address any issues that emerge between regularly scheduled on-site examinations. This year, we substantially updated these models to improve their performance. Thanks in large part to such efforts, examiners today conduct more of their supervisory activities offsite, helping to reduce the burden that is associated with on-site examinations at institutions like yours.  Beyond these changes, the Federal Reserve is participating in an ongoing interagency review of banking regulations pursuant to the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA. This review seeks to identify opportunities to streamline regulatory procedures and requirements when such changes would be consistent with maintaining bank safety and soundness. The Board has also supported various legislative changes that would ease regulatory burden. These include a recently proposed change that would permit supervisors to extend the time between on-site examinations to eighteen months for well-managed and well-capitalized banks with up to $500 million in assets. This change would double the current size threshold and has the potential to allow roughly 1,200 more community institutions to qualify for the extended examination cycle. In my remaining time, I would like to discuss some of the key financial and risk-management challenges that we have identified through our supervisory activities.  Banking has always been a business of taking and managing risks, but evolving market and economic conditions affect the types of opportunities available. In recent years, community banks have become more focused on commercial real estate lending, leading to a significant shift in the balance sheet and risk profiles of growing numbers of banks.  In most local markets, commercial real estate loans have performed well. Our examiners tell us that lending standards are generally sound and are not comparable to the standards that contributed to broad problems in the banking industry two decades ago. In particular, real estate appraisal practices have improved. However, more recently, there have been signs of some easing of underwriting standards. The rapid growth in commercial real estate exposures relative to capital and assets raises the possibility that risk-management practices in community banks may not have kept pace with growing concentrations and may be due for upgrades in oversight, policies, information systems, and stress testing.  In response to these developments, the federal banking agencies have recently proposed guidance that would focus examiners' attention on those loans that are particularly vulnerable to adverse market conditions--that is, loans dependent primarily on the sale, lease, or refinancing of commercial property as the source of repayment.  I emphasize that, in proposing this guidance, supervisors are not aiming to discourage banks from making sound loans in commercial real estate or in any other loan category. Rather, we are affirming the need for each bank to recognize the risks arising from concentration and to have in place appropriate risk-management practices and capital levels. Adjusting to changes in the level of short-term interest rates can also pose challenges to community banks. Thus far, the relative stability of community bank net interest margins suggests that they have done a good job of managing their interest rate risk exposure throughout the recent increase in market rates. Importantly, most community banks have effectively controlled the maturity distributions of their assets and made significant improvements over the past decade to their management and measurement of interest rate risk. Certainly, the procedures employed by community banks today are significantly more effective than those typically used as recently as a decade ago. However, we continue to see a small number of institutions with concentrations in longer-term assets. In these cases, our examiners encourage banks to gauge the risks of new yield-enhancing strategies over the intermediate and longer terms.  4 BIS Review 17/2006 
The unique funding structure of community banks supports their strong recent performance. For the most part, community banks continue to fund themselves primarily with relatively low cost and stable "core" deposits. However, a limited segment of community banks is increasing its reliance on wholesale sources of funding. Greater reliance on these sources places a premium on appropriate measurement and management of liquidity risk. Most community banks manage their liquidity risk positions well, but supervisory reviews suggest that some institutions have room for improvement. With the banking system enjoying a period of relatively high liquidity, now is a good time for all companies to assess the adequacy of their processes for managing liquidity risk. I emphasize that, on the whole, we do not have broad supervisory concerns with community banks. But it is only prudent to reiterate the importance of sound risk management to the continued success of community banks. Conclusion In closing, I want to return to where I began. In my judgment, well-managed and innovative community banks will continue to play a critical role in the U.S. economy. Community banks provide vital services for their customers and are key contributors to sustained economic growth, both locally and nationally. Indeed, the performance of community banks over the past decade has been very impressive. But neither bankers nor their supervisors should become complacent. Doubtless the future will continue to require both of us to evaluate and respond to changes that are often complex and difficult to understand, much less to predict. It has been my pleasure to be here today, and I look forward to working with you in the coming years to ensure the continued vitality of the U.S. banking and financial system. Thank you.

Ewart S Williams: A brief overview of developments in Trinidad and Tobago Opening remarks by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the Launch of Intercommercial Trust & Merchant Bank Limited, Port of Spain, 16 February 2006. *      *      * I am delighted to be here to share in the celebration of what I believe is the rebirth of the Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank Limited (ITMBL). Let me extend my sincere congratulations to the Board, management and staff of Intercommercial Bank Limited and its Trust and Merchant Bank. The rebranding of the Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank and all that goes with it – its stand-alone status; a new, restructured entity; its new location, situated in Port of Spain, in the middle of the financial centre, as it were – all of this carries enormous significance. It sends the message that IBL is now a full-fledged national financial institution which, with the support of its strategic partners, is willing to take on competitors both locally and regionally. Ladies and Gentlemen, this significant event is taking place at a most important juncture in our country’s economic and financial (history). In 2005, Trinidad and Tobago registered its twelfth consecutive year of robust economic growth; with inflation still basically in check; with a very strong balance of payments and with unemployment at perhaps at its lowest point ever. While much of this success can be traced to our oil fortunes, it also has to do with several years of sound economic policies, of which the liberalization of the financial sector was a significant part. This re-launch of Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank is taking place at a time when we are seeing the full benefits of financial sector liberalization. This is being reflected in the proliferation of a diversified range of financial institutions and the exponential growth in the financial asset base. With the structural changes now ongoing in the financial sector, Trinidad and Tobago has become a major source of regional financing, while our home-based financial institutions have expanded their presence through the CARICOM region.  Despite the rapid pace of expansion, the banking system has remained robust, as evidenced by all the main macro-prudential indicators. The data shows, for example, that:  (i) the banks are more than adequately capitalized, with their capital adequacy ratio            averaging close to 20 percent, far exceeding the statutory 8 percent minimum;  (ii) non-performing loans for the banking system, as a whole, are in the region of 2            percent, having come down markedly from double-digit levels that prevailed during the   nineties;  (iii)  provisions are at a reassuringly high level, with the coverage ratio relative to non-           performing loans, exceeding 61 percent; and  (iv)  banks are recording strong profits with the average return on assets in the vicinity of 3.5   percent. The Intercommercial Bank has been very much a part of this extraordinary period of development of the financial sector, having been born out of the process of financial liberalization, which dominated the mid-1990s. From its inception, IBL was a unique institution. While the initial capital may have been foreign, it was essentially a local bank with local management, emerging not too long after three local commercial banks had got into difficulties and needed to be liquidated. As such, the creation of the IBL was a strong affirmation on the part of its founders, of their confidence in the economy and in the financial sector of Trinidad and Tobago. From the outset, IBL had to face severe challenges – it was a small bank, in competition with much larger and long established banks. It did not enjoy the economies of scale that go with size but moreover, it was a regional bank, in central Trinidad, without the national reach of the larger banks. Against this background, the fact that IBL has survived and has prospered, is a credit to its founders, to its Board and to the management and staff of the Bank, who had to substitute, efficiency and service quality for financial strength. With commendable insight the management of IBL, early in the BIS Review 17/2006 1 
game, staked out a strategic market niche focusing on core banking, geared to meeting the personal and business needs of a small but thriving geographical area. IBL is unique in another sense – it has turned the conventional CARICOM order on its head. Over the last few years there has been a proliferation of crossborder ownership in the CARICOM region. However, invariably, this has meant Trinidad and Tobago banks expanding their wings abroad. The acquisition of IBL by the Jamaica Money Market Brokers reflected a reversal of this dominant order. Today, with its stake in IBL and CMMB, among others, JMMB has become an important player in the regional financial markets. The re-launch of the Intercommercial Bank Trust and Merchant Bank Limited is an affirmation that IBL has consolidated its position in its core banking business and now feels itself secure enough, confident enough and strong enough to spread its wings. The re-launch is also timely from a business viewpoint as it places the bank in a position to participate in the burgeoning capital market, which is now rivaling the traditional banking sector institutions as a preferred source of business financing. It will certainly help that the Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank would have the capital market experience of both JMMB and CMMB to rely on.  Over the last five years the value of sovereign bond placements in Trinidad and Tobago has amounted to more than $16 billion while private debt issues have amounted to $10.5 billion over the period. Also, with the rapid diversification of the economy, trade and project financing, commercial paper and various forms of structured finance typical of merchant banks, are increasingly becoming important sources of funding business activity. So there is a good case for a re-entry into merchant banking. However, merchant banking has its own challenges. As bankers, you know that dependence on diversified funding sources such as money market instruments and long-term foreign currency borrowings is invariably more risky than dependence on vanilla deposits. On the assets side, secured loans and advances, which are the standard fare of commercial banks, carry lower risk than the investments that are likely to dominate the balance sheets of merchant banks. In short, the shift to merchant banking will create demands for new competencies, new systems and new governance and risk management structures. As you know, the evolving structure of the financial system is also creating new challenges for the Central Bank as regulator. We are currently addressing these challenges through:  (i)  transforming our supervisory system into a more integrated risk-based framework; and  (ii)  strengthening our overall legal and regulatory infrastructure, in line with international best   practices.  In particular, this implies, inter alia:  (i)  ensuring that institutions – big and small – have adequate governance systems in place;  (ii)  insisting on enhanced reporting and disclosure standards;           (iii)   putting in place procedures for the sharing of information with other regulators both   locally and regionally; and (iv) ensuring that financial institutions strengthen their risk   management practices. In this context, the Bank is working on amending capital   adequacy rules to ensure that all major risks are appropriately identified and mitigated. I was very impressed by the mission statement of the Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank – to be a champion for financial development and prosperity of individuals and companies while adhering to your core values of honesty, integrity, openness, respect and love. This is indeed a laudable mission. But I am sure you know that to succeed, you will face challenges not least among which will be the reality of facing competition from your rivals, with greater financial strength and the tremendous advantage of a head-start. But IBL, your parent institution, faced similar challenges and overcame. I am certain that with the help of your strategic partners, JMMB and CMMB, you would not only survive but thrive and hopefully grow to be in your words “the most admired financial services organization”, not only in Trinidad and Tobago, but in the region. 2 BIS Review 17/2006 
Once again, let me congratulate the Board, management and staff of the Intercommercial Trust and Merchant Bank and extend my best wishes for your success. BIS Review 17/2006 3 
Michael C Bonello: The challenges faced by the Maltese economy ahead of euro adoption and their implications for monetary policy Interview with Mr Michael C Bonello, Governor of the Central Bank of Malta, by The Times, 2 March 2006. *      *      * 1. It has been reported that Malta needs a real growth rate of 4 per cent per annum if it is to reach the EU average per capita GDP in 20 years. Growth, in fact, only averaged about 0.5 per cent in real terms in the five years to 2005. Are you preoccupied? More important than expressing concern is the need to understand the reasons for this slow growth. Since the turn of the century the economy has faced challenges of both external and domestic origin, and the recent period of weakness reflects the size of the task ahead. The slowdown began in 2001 with external shocks to the key sectors of tourism and semi-conductors. Since then the relatively slow growth in Malta’s main trading partners has been compounded by the competitive pressures unleashed by globalization and by our integration in the single European market, all of which has forced an acceleration in the pace of restructuring of the manufacturing sector. At the same time that we were opening up our markets, low-cost producers were undercutting our competitiveness, particularly in labour intensive sectors. These, along with the sharply higher price of imported oil since last year, are among the factors that have contributed to the slow down. In the long run the changes brought about by globalization and by the correction of the economy’s structural imbalances should enhance growth prospects, but the coincidence of the same two events has made for a difficult transition. It is also true that the economy could have been better prepared to cope with such shocks. That, however, would have required a greater degree of foresight and a timely reordering of priorities in the allocation of scarce resources. Regrettably, our national governance system is not conducive to the achievement of consensual solutions to issues having longterm implications. This explains why the process of reform tends to be rather slow and the outcome often less than ideal. The persistence of rigidities in product and labour markets, a partial wage indexation system, failure to anticipate the consequences of demographic trends and insufficient investment in physical infrastructure and in human resources in earlier years are some of the reasons why the economy lacks the flexibility to react to external developments as successfully as some of its competitors. This does not mean that the economy is not headed in the right direction. Appropriate policies are indeed in place in several key areas, policy coherence is improving and financing is available to implement the national reform programme. This much has been acknowledged by the EU Commission and the IMF. As the restructuring process moves on, moreover, the industrial sector is increasingly composed of more resilient firms producing higher value added products, while new, important sources of output growth are emerging, such as financial and ICT-related services. I, therefore, believe that there are grounds for cautious optimism, provided we persevere. It will, however, take time; there are no easy short cuts to faster growth. 2. EU accession was meant to boost our trade. In fact, exports were down by 11.3 per cent in 2005, although the EU’s share edged up slightly to 51.5 per cent. Don’t tell me the problem is the EU economy, not ours ... First, let’s get the facts right. While Malta’s exports did fall by 11.3% last year, exports to the EU were only 5.2% lower. The drop, moreover, was entirely due to reduced sales of electronic goods and clothes. Sales of some other product categories to the EU increased. And do not forget that Malta is also increasingly an exporter of services, which are not included in these numbers. Second, in the real world it is hardly ever the case that things are either black or white. For a start, it is a proven fact that membership of a single market, particularly in the presence of a monetary union, results in a marked expansion of intra-market trade. That has been the experience of existing EU and euro area members. It is not reasonable, however, to expect that to happen in the first full year after membership! Exploiting the new market opportunities takes time because institutional structures and BIS Review 16/2006 1 
operating practices need to be adapted. Some of the funds Malta is getting from the EU are being used precisely to strengthen the economy’s export potential. At the same time, it is also true that the EU economy did not grow as rapidly as anticipated in 2005. It expanded by 1.6 per cent, compared with 2.3 per cent in 2004. A higher proportion than ever of consumer demand, moreover, was satisfied by imports from more competitive producers at the expense of established suppliers.  Finally, as I have already observed, the persistence of sluggish growth in the Maltese economy cannot be explained exclusively in terms of a cyclical downturn. Delays in implementing effective competitiveness-enhancing reforms were also a factor. As a result, the economy was not fully prepared to exploit the single market.  3. In these circumstances, isn’t this the worst time to be strait-jacketed by the conditions for euro adoption? Wouldn’t a fiscal boost speed up economic growth, now that your already limited monetary policy tools have been put in the shed? Allow me first to correct two misconceptions implicit in your second question. For a start, our monetary policy tools have not been put away but are available for use if needed, as was the case in April last year when the Bank’s central intervention rate was raised by 25 basis points. The primary objective of our monetary policy, moreover, is not to influence the level of economic activity. It is to maintain price stability, which we pursue through the operation of a fixed exchange rate. We, therefore, use our monetary policy tools in the first instance to provide support for the currency. Now your question echoes the view of those who argue that if only we were to delay adopting the euro, the government would be able to spend more and run a higher budget deficit because it would not have to meet the deficit criterion this year, and thereby help the economy grow faster. It sounds very attractive, but would it work? First, the argument is based on the premise that increased government spending produces jobs and growth. In a small, open economy, things are not that simple. If more money is spent on infrastructure projects, there will be increased imports of raw materials and other inputs; and of the money that remains in Malta in the form of wages, a high proportion will also be spent on imports. These leakages will diminish the benefit to the economy from the multiplier effect of the increased spending. Thus, for example, our calculations suggest that had the government invested Lm18.5 million more in 2005, keeping the deficit at the 2004 level, the GDP would have been around Lm14.5 million higher last year. Against this benefit, moreover, one would have to set off the costs. For example, a higher deficit means an increase in the public debt of equal amount, and thus more annual interest to be paid out of recurrent revenue. Besides, for the reasons I gave earlier, a higher deficit translates into a wider trade gap (by an estimated Lm7.5 million in the above example). Proponents of more government spending should also bear in mind that even in the absence of the euro adoption factor, Malta would still have to abide by the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). You might recall that even the British Government, which has no immediate plans to adopt the euro, was called to order by the EU Council some time ago because of its growing budget deficit. Then again, sound public finances are fundamentally a matter of economic common sense and prudence. So much so that in recent years there have been repeated calls on the government from all quarters to reduce the deficit and the public debt. Is it not strange, therefore, that just when headway is finally being made in this very direction, we hear calls for a reversal of this policy and for engineering what would at best be a short-term boost to growth? One should also bear in mind that Malta’s main challenge is to become more internationally competitive. In this respect, an increased fiscal deficit will not solve anything. Malta needs quality growth, preferably resulting from foreign direct investment, which brings with it capital, technology and markets. And that kind of investment tends to go to countries with sound economic fundamentals, including a budget that is balanced over the course of the business cycle. More immediately, if we renege on the Convergence Programme targets, there would be a real risk of a drop in investor confidence. This is confirmed by recent developments in interest rates and in bond markets in central Europe, where markets have started to punish countries who risk delaying euro 2 BIS Review 16/2006 
adoption. It is indeed relevant to point out that Malta’s current ‘A’ rating is predicated upon the continued pursuit of fiscal consolidation. There is an additional short-term gain from staying on course. As I have mentioned, fiscal restraint also helps to reduce the country’s external imbalance, and this, in turn, could allow a cut in the interest premium that investors require in order to hold Maltese lira assets. This would mean lower interest rates.  On balance, therefore, the outcome of a u-turn on fiscal policy is unlikely to be positive. 4. Last year’s entry in ERM II has been described as hasty and premature. Why the rush to join the euro? Does it not rule out any possible adjustments to the value of the lira? One of the arguments made in support of this view is that our euro adoption calendar does not allow government to run a higher deficit and thus promote faster growth. I have just explained why I am not convinced by this argument. As for the claim that the decision to enter ERM II was hasty and premature, that suggests recklessness! No, there was no rush. The decision was made after thorough consultations with the EU Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) in the light of the progress achieved by Malta in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms. Their agreement was contingent on a firm undertaking by the Maltese authorities to continue to implement the Convergence Programme. A related objection is that before adopting the euro Malta should first satisfy tests similar to those set for the British economy by Chancellor Brown. This argument betrays an insufficient familiarity with the Chancellor’s five tests. They are, in fact, not so different from the Maastricht criteria, which Malta, together with the six other new Member States currently in ERM II, is seeking to satisfy. The five tests relate to convergence (like the Maastricht criteria); flexibility of labour, product and capital markets (being addressed in Malta’s Convergence Programme); investment, i.e. whether euro will encourage more inward FDI (the British Treasury’s 2003 report suggests that it does); financial services (this applies to the special case of the City of London); and growth, stability and employment. Malta’s strategy document, published jointly by the Government and the Bank last year, argues that the euro would be beneficial in this respect (and so does the Treasury report). The case for adopting the euro sooner rather than later is set out in the strategy document. I shall only reiterate here that for a small, open economy like ours with no trade or capital controls, keeping a separate currency leaves us exposed to external shocks and volatile capital flows. We are thus obliged to maintain a large amount of external reserves. These are financial assets that could perhaps earn higher rates of return if invested domestically. Instead, we invest them abroad, in effect promoting foreign, rather than domestic growth. That is the price we pay to have an independent currency. This vulnerability is indeed one of the main reasons why some leading academics in this field believe that the small new Member States should have been allowed to lock themselves into the relatively greater security of the euro area as quickly as possible. The validity of this view was underscored by Malta’s experience in late 2004/early 2005 when the Bank’s external reserves declined as a result of uncertainty created by speculative comments on the exchange rate. Your second question reflects the view that the fixed nature of the exchange rate as well as the level at which the lira was pegged to the euro in ERM II are both inappropriate and are stifling Malta’s competitiveness.  Let me first address the issue of the fixed peg. This has been a mainstay of our monetary policy for over three decades. It is what Maltese traders and investors, and the public at large, have become accustomed to. The resulting exchange rate and price stability have made a vital contribution to the country’s economic development. Opting for a new and unfamiliar regime, which is what the 15 per cent band arrangement amounts to, in the midst of the uncertainty prevailing early last year would not have been prudent. The decision to opt for continuity by pegging the lira to the euro at the central parity rate, moreover, was also supported by our study on the equilibrium exchange rate, available on the Bank’s website, which did not produce evidence of a significant misalignment; and by our conviction – which is shared by expert opinion in Malta and abroad – that given the openness of the economy and the speed of the nominal exchange rate pass-through to prices, a possible devaluation is anyway unlikely to have lasting beneficial effects. The 1992 experience proved that devaluation is not the correct antidote for BIS Review 16/2006 3 
structural problems. In less than three years, the inflationary pressures resulting from that decision wiped out whatever competitiveness gain had been achieved. In the event, the commitment to keep the lira/euro peg at the central parity rate – which was also welcomed by the IMF - seems to have reassured both the business community and investors as calm returned to the financial markets. The downward trend in the reserves was first interrupted and then reversed, as capital inflows resumed, including a considerable amount resulting from the redenomination of domestic loans into euro to take advantage of the lower interest rate. In these circumstances, had we allowed the exchange rate to adjust to market pressures within the 15 per cent band, the currency would have appreciated. 5. You seem to be playing down the efficacy of the fiscal deficit and of exchange rate adjustment as a means of jump starting the economy. What would you suggest instead? As I have already pointed out, the domestic factors which are contributing to the economy’s anaemic growth record are largely microeconomic in nature. I have also explained why deficit financing and changes in the nominal exchange rate cannot correct these weaknesses, still less produce sustainable growth. Policy orientation must eschew short-term palliatives. Like our competitors we must learn to come to terms with globalization. Reflecting on one simple fact should help in understanding what this means: the hourly cost of labour of an electronics operative in Malta is around $11, compared with $7 in Singapore and $2 in China. Neither more government spending nor a devaluation can narrow that gap. Against this background, maintaining external competitiveness in the long run depends on continued moderation in wage growth, faster increases in labour productivity and sustainable budget positions. I make no claim to originality in proposing this prescription; it is shared by the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF. I shall first address the last objective. Given that taxation levels are already high, fiscal consolidation should be achieved by cutting recurrent spending. Here I would focus on reducing the public sector wage bill, mainly by lowering employment levels, as government is currently doing; reforming the provision of pensions and health care; rationalizing social welfare schemes, including by eliminating benefits that have outlived their usefulness and extending means testing; and transforming the unemployment benefit system into an effective instrument of employment creation rather than of social dependence. With regard to competitiveness-related problems, there is a need to address remaining rigidities in the labour market – including by ensuring that wage costs reflect productivity levels; investing more in education and providing suitable incentives to unleash the potential inherent in the country’s human resources; and improving the business environment, in particular by lowering the costs of operating in Malta. While it is beyond dispute that the country has undergone significant change for the better in these first years of the new century, it is equally true that the world around us has become a much more dynamic place in the meantime, and competitive pressures are such that unless we adapt to them rapidly, we will have to accept lower living standards.  6. Euro yields have risen yet you have left the central intervention rate unchanged… This proves that our limited monetary policy tools have not been put in the shed, as you put it in an earlier question! We still have a degree of autonomy. As I said earlier, the exchange rate is the nominal anchor of our monetary policy. The rationale of our regime, i.e., providing support to the currency, does indeed require us to mirror interest rates offered by other currencies – primarily the euro since we moved to a full peg last May – , but in addition we also need to offer a premium to holders of Maltese lira assets to compensate for the small size and vulnerability of our economy. Our judgement on the appropriate size of that premium at any point in time, complemented by considerations relating to financial market sentiment and economic conditions generally, determines our decisions on the Bank’s central intervention rate. The markets have so far judged the interest rate premium on the lira as being appropriate.  4 BIS Review 16/2006 
7. It would be ironic if the government were to meet the fiscal criterion for euro adoption, but fail because of the inflation rate. What interest rate policy will the Bank adopt in this regard? I have already explained that the focus of monetary policy in a fixed peg regime is the exchange rate. Unlike most countries with a floating regime, we are not inflation targeters. The Bank’s ability to influence price levels directly through its power to change short-term interest rates in the money market is, therefore, rather limited. To the extent, however, that a rise in inflation is associated with developments that are putting pressure on the exchange rate in the shape of a persistent loss of external reserves, such as a surge in consumer imports financed by credit creation, then a higher interest rate could have a cooling effect. In Malta’s open trading environment, one would expect prices to respond more effectively to market forces than seems to be the case. The relatively small number of importers of essential commodities and of providers of some services that have a significant weight in the retail price index is a disadvantage in this respect. There are governmental agencies whose responsibility it is to ensure that competition and price transparency prevail. Containing local costs, including government-induced costs, should also be a priority in this crucial ERM II phase. In its capacity as advisor to the government, the Bank takes every opportunity to express any concerns that it may have in this regard. 8. In addition to the short-term pressure of the Maastricht criteria, there is the longterm reality of the welfare gap. Are you frustrated with the pace of pension reform? A sense of disappointment best sums up my feelings. I am all for consultation and consensus building, but the time comes when decisions need to be taken if further damage is to be avoided. This applies equally to the social welfare and health systems as it does to pensions. Last year the first cohorts of the baby-boom generation reached retirement age. This produced an acceleration of some Lm7 million in the rate of increase of pension expenditures. Pension reform, which is vital for the long-term sustainability of public finances, should be implemented this year. Everybody has had a say and there is now a comprehensive, balanced set of proposals which answer to the widest possible range of concerns compatibly with having a viable system. It is time to move on to other pressing issues.  9. Property values continue to increase against a background of a rising volume of bank credit that is being channeled into construction and house purchase. Are there grounds for concern? Property values are estimated to have increased by about 9% in 2005. Although this represents a slowdown from previous years, it is still in excess of recent inflation and occurred despite a continuing high vacancy rate. The ready availability of credit contributes to rising property prices. While the volume of bank credit to the construction industry was more or less flat last year, borrowing to finance the construction or purchase of housing went up by 21% to Lm653 million. These numbers, moreover, must be viewed in the context of total household borrowing. Consumer credit, including through credit cards, increased by 13% in 2005 to Lm91 million. This is an area where the banks are marketing their products rather aggressively, encouraging borrowing for consumption rather than for investment purposes. One has to be concerned about this, particularly at a time of slow growth in household disposable income, and about the resulting increase in the consumer debt burden. For while the default rate of household borrowing, particularly mortgage loans, remains low, much lower in fact than that of the corporate sector, existing and prospective borrowers may not be factoring into calculations of their repayment capacity the possibility that interest rates might not remain at their current low levels indefinitely. While the exuberance which took hold of the property market in recent years appears to have moderated somewhat, a similar phenomenon has emerged in the equity market. The optimism that is driving up share prices is supported by strong corporate profitability in a few cases. Current trends, however, are taking prices into territory where the connection with intrinsic values becomes less obvious, and suggest caution. BIS Review 16/2006 5 
10. Economic analysts can sound gloomy warnings to keep pushing the authorities in the right direction, or ring the bells proclaiming good news and risk undermining the sense of determination needed. Which approach would you advocate? Neither of the two. There is already so much spin created by purveyors of pessimism and optimism alike that it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a balanced reading of the economic situation. Independent economic analysts, therefore, shoulder a heavy responsibility. It is to bring together all the relevant information, subject it to a critical but objective assessment, and be prepared to support their conclusions with well documented arguments. This is a role the Bank has endeavoured to play consistently, and for good reason. The more people understand how our economy works, the challenges it is facing and the limited options available to overcome them, the greater the likelihood that policymakers will feel comfortable to take the required decisions promptly, leading to a faster pace of wealth creation, which is one thing we all want. 11. The adoption of the euro will greatly reduce the role of the Central Bank of Malta. What will you be doing in January 2008? Your question reflects a perception that is commonly held but which is not borne out by the experience of the current members of the euro area. It would be more correct to say that the Bank’s role will be greatly changed rather than reduced. Some existing functions will become less important, others more so, and yet others created. On the institutional level, the transfer of responsibility for monetary policy to the ECB would be replaced by the Governor’s participation in the Governing Council where interest rates are set for the euro area. For this purpose, we will need to strengthen our capacity in the areas of economic research, forecasting and statistics and redirect its focus. This also applies to our activities in support of monetary policy, such as open market operations, which would be conducted within the parameters set by the ECB. In the area of foreign exchange, there would no longer be a need to provide marketmaking facilities once the euro becomes our domestic currency, or to retain the current foreign exchange facilities offered to government at their existing level. Our reserve management role, however, would remain; not only to manage our own reserves, but also to manage part of the ECB’s portfolio. Likewise, the Bank would retain its function as issuer of notes and coins and would thus have to meet the local demand for euro. It would also need to analyse suspected counterfeit euro notes and coins. Particularly important will be the Bank’s role in providing a channel for both domestic and cross border, high value payments by linking our payment system with the Eurosystem’s TARGET, as well as in operating a mechanism for the cross border delivery of assets for collateralisation purposes. The adoption of the euro will also integrate further Malta’s financial system with that of the euro area, so that the Bank’s financial stability and internal audit responsibilities will assume a cross border dimension because weaknesses in any one Member State could impact directly on the stability of the entire system. For example, we will have to cooperate closely with other central banks and the ECB to prevent the emergence of systemic crises. This will involve strengthening our institutional and analytical capacities to detect potential vulnerabilities in our own financial system. As for the audit role, we will have to provide internal control assurances to the ECB on all the functions we will be carrying out on their behalf. All of this, of course, has important implications for essential support functions such as information technology and human resources. I need only mention the fact that euro area membership entails considerable electronic reporting obligations and the maintenance of several statistical databases. The Bank is gearing up to take on these new, more specialized functions, and I would like to note that it is only able to do so with confidence because it has a substantial core of qualified and dedicated professionals in all these areas. 6 BIS Review 16/2006 
Ewart S Williams: The Caribbean Money Market Brokers - impact on Trinidad and Tobago Feature address by Mr Ewart S Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago, at the launch of the Caribbean Money Market Brokers Composite Leading Indicator, Trinidad, 24 January 2006. *      *      * Let me begin by thanking the Managing Director of Caribbean Money Market Brokers (CMMB) for inviting me to share this occasion with you and for affording me the opportunity to address a few words to this distinguished gathering.  Let me hasten as well to congratulate CMMB on yet another important initiative. In its five short years of existence, CMMB has made a significant impact on the economic and financial scene in Trinidad and Tobago. It has enhanced the operations of the capital market by introducing new approaches to liquidity management for financial institutions and other firms as well; CMMB has also made a contribution to expanding financial education and through its research activities, has helped investors understand capital markets better.  This morning’s occasion marks another important initiative from CMMB. The introduction of a Composite Leading Indicator of developments in our economy will add an important piece of information to our statistical base. This indicator represents an enhancement of the information set available to analysts, market practitioners and other decision makers including the Central Bank. Accordingly, I warmly commend CMMB’s efforts.  The international financial crises of the mid and late 1990s underscored the fact that globalization had put a premium on the availability of timely, reliable and comprehensive data. Unfortunately, many developing countries, including Trinidad and Tobago, have not addressed these critical statistical requirements in a systematic way.  While good official statistics are a valuable public resource in any national context, their role in guiding the formulation of public policy gives them an even greater importance in developing countries, where the impact of public policy decisions tends to be amplified in the presence of large economic and social imbalances. Good statistical systems, therefore, tend to provide a relatively higher social return in countries such as Trinidad and Tobago.  Over the years, we in Trinidad and Tobago have developed a fairly good set of basic statistics. We produce the standard annual national income accounts; we have very good energy sector data; our price and employment indices are of good quality; we have timely fiscal accounts (at least for Central Government); we have very good monetary, financial and balance of payments data; and reasonably complete information on public sector debt. But we need to go beyond our present database. Trinidad and Tobago is now undergoing rapid transformation, a process that demands a greater role for market forces in fostering a more competitive environment and a more efficient resource allocation. For us, complementary data beyond the core statistical data series mentioned above are needed. Last year, we joined a long list of developing countries in subscribing to the IMF General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS). We are working actively to meet the higher standards, the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS), which has been adopted by the developed and the emerging market economies.  Given our responsibilities as policy makers and regulators of the financial system, we at the Central Bank can claim a higher than average stake in the development of our statistical base. Our new monetary policy framework – centred around the Repo rate - places a high premium on the ability to accurately measure the pulse of the economy at any point in time and to anticipate short term trends. Very often this is a difficult task because sufficient information is not available on a timely basis.  The Bank has tried to close the gap itself by introducing new series. For example, we have introduced quarterly GDP estimates, export and import price indices, as well as new indicators of export competitiveness. We are currently working on the development of a range of indicators of building costs and real estate prices as well as more comprehensive estimates of consumer spending and private indebtedness.  BIS Review 16/2006 1 
Large capital flows have now become an important element in the economic landscape of Trinidad and Tobago. These flows have significant consequences for exchange markets, and their abrupt variations (in either capital inflows or outflows) can be a signal of impending problems. The Central Bank is now working closely with private financial institutions and with the Trinidad and Tobago Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to collate more reliable data on the capital account of the balance of payments. For countries with access to international capital markets, like Trinidad and Tobago, reliable and timely data along with transparent statistical practices are a basic requirement. Important institutional changes are currently in train at the Central Statistical Office (CSO) to strengthen the organization’s autonomy and to enable it to better fulfill this mandate. The key to the restructuring is the planned transition of the institution to Executive Status (similar to the Central Bank) and the implementation of measures to build operational capacity, including the strengthening of its human resources.  These institutional changes will need to be accompanied by the use of more modern techniques. Nowadays, information providers are engaged in more active deployment of web-enabled technology to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information. In Trinidad and Tobago, however, our data compilation system is still largely based on manual forms when web-based forms would improve the speed of data collection and dissemination.  We also need to change the culture towards the provision of statistical information. It needs to start with Government agencies and state enterprises that tend to see the compilation of records in a way that facilitates analysis, as a bother. The private sector also needs to recognize that there is value in providing data even if it may imply a slight inconvenience. The private sector should be assured that accepted statistical standards require that data on individual firms are not published individually in order to protect confidentiality.  The launch by CMMB of a Composite Leading Indicator (CMMB CLI) is an important development, in that it provides a flash estimate of current economic trends. The indicator should be easily understood as it is based on a set of readily available series. The indicator could, in principle, be very useful for analysts, investors and businessmen alike, and would give an additional piece of information to the Central Bank on which to base monetary policy decisions. That CMMB, as a private sector institution, has moved to fill this important need; this is a positive development. It underscores the fact that the business of developing statistical information is not only for the CSO or the Central Bank but is a responsibility of all economic stakeholders. I call on trade associations and industry groups to follow the example.  Let me again congratulate CMMB on this worthwhile initiative. You have established a new standard among private financial institutions in terms of the provision of timely and relevant information for decision making. Additional efforts like these would go a long way to strengthening the country’s statistical infrastructure.  2 BIS Review 16/2006 
Mario Draghi: Financial market integration and the intermediation of savings Address by Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the 12th Congress AIAF - ASSIOM - ATIC FOREX, Cagliari, 4 March 2006. *      *      * 1. The world economy: expansion and imbalances The world economy is enjoying a period of strong and widespread expansion. Despite sharp increases in the prices of raw materials, inflationary pressures remain moderate. Yet in some respects it remains fragile.  The expansion began in 2002 thanks to the recovery in the United States and the support from China’s booming economy. It gained strength from the middle of 2003 onwards, with the average annual rate of growth rising to nearly 5 per cent, and has spread gradually, if unevenly, to every region of the world, although in somewhat weaker form in Europe. In Italy, after stagnating in 2005, the economy now shows some signs of recovery. There is still uncertainty, however, about the extent and durability of the country’s economic growth, which continues to be weighed down by unresolved structural problems. World economic activity has benefited from the persistence of stable financial conditions that have been exceptionally propitious for investment. Apart from the expansionary stance of monetary and budgetary policies, other contributory factors have been the integration of financial markets, their development in emerging regions, the spread of more efficient instruments for the management of risk and the progress made in the fields of crisis prevention and financial supervision. The economic upswing has generated strong demand for oil, especially by China and the other emerging Asian economies. Despite increased supply, this demand has been met with difficulty and at rising prices. The price of oil has doubled in real terms since the spring of 2003. So far this pressure has not been passed on to core inflation, which has remained moderate everywhere, testifying to the credibility gained by monetary policy in the leading countries. This credibility is precious and needs to be preserved. It is the reason, especially in the euro area, why monetary conditions continue to be very relaxed: interest rates remain near the lowest levels ever. The monetary and credit aggregates continue to expand rapidly; the prices of real assets are high; no restrictive impulses are coming from the exchange rate. Keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored at a level consistent with price stability is essential for economic growth and the creation of jobs. The increase in the key rates decided on Thursday by the Governing Council of the ECB serves this purpose. Although the world economic expansion is widespread, it is accompanied by very large external imbalances. These are caused by the divergences in the growth of domestic demand between the main regions and the massive transfer of resources from oil-consuming to oil-producing countries. The US external deficit has been increasing since the middle of the 1990s, although the causes have changed over the years. Initially, it reflected the capital formation associated with the spread of new information technology. Boosted by increasingly good prospects of growth, consumption also rose faster than disposable income. The current account deficit was financed thanks to massive inflows of private capital, attracted by the high yields expected on the stock market, especially for high-tech securities, while the appreciation of the dollar further exacerbated the trade deficit. In 2001 the determinants of the current account deficit began to change. In the face of the risk of recession, monetary and fiscal policies were made expansionary. The saving rate continued to decline. Consumption was sustained by the rising value of property; households’ propensity to save turned negative in 2005. The federal budget balance deteriorated by 6 percentage points of GDP between 2000 and 2004 and will show another large deficit in 2006. The manner of financing the external deficit also changed. The inflow of private capital slowed between 2002 and 2004. The dollar came under downward pressure, despite much larger purchases by the monetary authorities of countries with current account surpluses. Such purchases are liable to undergo rapid change. In 2005 these countries reduced their accumulation of official reserves, only China recording a further massive increase. However, the widening of the short-term interest rate BIS Review 15/2006 1 
spread prompted renewed private sector investment in the dollar, which gained strength as a consequence. The appreciation of the dollar came to a halt last November. However, as things stand, the exchange rates between the major currencies are not conducive to adjustment of the external imbalances. High rates of growth have so far made it possible to postpone the adjustment, but these conditions cannot last indefinitely. In 2005 various conditions arose that could help initiate a process of adjustment. Domestic demand accelerated in Japan, and to a lesser extent in Europe as well. The reform of China’s foreign exchange system, although it has only produced a small appreciation of the renminbi so far, is a step in the right direction; a cooling of the US property market, of which there are signs, might slow the growth of private consumption. An adjustment of the underlying real imbalances is the best guarantee of orderly progress. For this to happen, the current trends need to be supported by a combination of more restrictive fiscal policy in the United States, greater exchange rate flexibility in the Asian economies, and structural reform in Europe. 2. International financial conditions On the international financial markets real interest rates and the volatility of financial assets are low. Relaxed and stable financial conditions foster economic growth, which in turn is conducive to such conditions. At the same time they may reflect a reduced perception of risk by market participants and encourage them to build up illiquid and highly risky positions. The low level of long-term interest rates is mainly the result of continuing expectations of moderate inflation, even over a very considerable time span. These expectations are based on the credibility of monetary policies. Investors accept modest returns in part because they have a perception of diminished risk, related to the limited volatility of securities prices and to conditions in the real economy. The expansionary cycle and wage moderation have sustained the growth in corporate profits, thereby improving the state of firms’ finances. The insolvency rate is well below the long-run average. The spread between corporate and public-sector bonds is now unprecedentedly narrow. Other contributory factors in keeping interest rates down have been the investment of current account surpluses by the Asian economies and the oilexporting countries and an increase in investments by pension funds. These flows have proved unresponsive to the tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and the ECB; its effect has been limited to the shorter term maturities. The yield curve has flattened, particularly in the United States. In view of the historically low level of interest rates on risk-free assets, there has been a surge in the demand for riskier securities by investors in search of higher returns.  In this context, the reduction in risk premiums no longer reflects only a diminution of the underlying risks, but also agents’ reduced risk aversion. Nor can it be ruled out that the premiums asked to hedge risks underestimate their true magnitude. The favourable conditions on the financial markets delay the correction of real imbalances, masking the symptoms without removing the causes. The international markets have become more robust, contributing to an orderly reallocation of financial flows. The conditions are right for this to take place gradually, in a context of more balanced but strong global growth. However, geopolitical events, such as sharper internal and international tensions in the oil-producing countries or shocks due to individual corporate events or linked to single sectors of production, could trigger brusque changes in agents’ attitudes and a sudden reallocation of savings and investments, leading to wide swings in the prices of real and financial assets and in exchange rates. This possibility is small today but not entirely absent. The widespread use of derivative instruments may offer a better means of risk management, but it could also accelerate the propagation of extreme events. 3. Integrated, efficient and robust markets Efficient and well-regulated markets, apart from performing their normal function of allocating financial resources in the best way possible, are crucial to ensuring that the system is robust enough to withstand violent shocks, however unlikely. 2 BIS Review 15/2006 
Policies designed to speed the integration of Europe’s financial markets and their infrastructure contribute to orderly and lasting economic growth. Market integration allows firms to exploit economies of scale by reducing the cost of access; it increases the opportunities for diversifying investments; it ensures more efficient allocation of resources; it improves the ability to absorb shocks; it strengthens the stability of the system. In Europe, market integration has been furthered by the single currency and the stability-oriented monetary policy. It has not gone far enough yet. Additional measures are needed to harmonize laws and regulations and adapt the infrastructure. The greatest progress has been made in the money market, thanks among other things to the development of the TARGET settlement system. In November 2007 this will be superseded by TARGET 2, which will bring further benefits to firms in terms of liquidity management. As you know, the Bank of Italy has been a key figure in the project, alongside the French and German central banks, and intends to maintain that role. In the case of government securities, common platforms such as MTS have gradually extended their operations, increasing the liquidity and efficiency of the European market. The equity market is still fragmented. There are evident advantages, typical of a network economy, in concentrating trades; the attraction of a stock market for issuers and brokers grows with the number of present and prospective participants. On the other hand, for the stock of smaller firms in particular, the information advantages of national markets lead to better liquidity conditions. Forms of horizontal consolidation and federation between national markets would achieve both benefits. Unrestricted and equal access to settlement systems and multiple links between the various markets would foster both competition and efficiency.  Italy’s stock exchange faces the challenge of adapting to the new context. Our primary goal should be to ensure ease of access to European markets and infrastructure for our firms and intermediaries. We need to reflect together on the best way to achieve this. The integration of securities clearing and settlement systems has not yet reached a satisfactory level owing to differences in national infrastructures that predated the launch of the monetary union. The existence of numerous national systems, with their non-standard services, diverse market practices and different laws and tax rules, increases the risks and costs of settling cross-border transactions. Some specific barriers to integrating post-trading systems have been clearly identified. The removal of those created by differences in laws and regulations will require sometimes complex legislative intervention. The removal of strictly technical barriers and barriers created by market practices can be effected at the initiative of market operators themselves. There is no reason to wait. A set of European rules is already in place to promote market integration and transparency by regulating such matters as settlement finality, market abuse, collateral, prospectuses and takeover bids. The directive on markets in financial instruments issued in April 2004 will spur competition by abolishing the requirement to conduct all transactions on regulated markets, encourage the provision of crossborder financial services and strengthen investor protection. The complex process of implementing the directive must be speeded up, at both Community and national level. 4. The role of intermediaries in asset management The saving rate of the Italian economy, especially among households, is still high, despite a long-term downward trend. It is associated with a level of household wealth that is also high. Savings continue to be a fundamental resource for economic growth. Efficient management of the country’s savings is a competitive challenge and an opportunity for growth, both of the economy as a whole and of the financial industry. In Italy as elsewhere the composition of households’ financial wealth has shifted in the last few years, as a result of more active, diversified and efficient portfolio management. Between 1995 and 2004 the share of bank and postal deposits fell from more than 40 per cent to barely 25 per cent and that of publicsector securities from 23 to 7 per cent, while the incidence of private-sector bonds, equities and investment fund units increased. Fund units are now as important as in the other leading industrial countries. The share of insurance products and private pension funds is much smaller, however, essentially because of the broad coverage provided by the public pension system. The share of private-sector bonds, in particular bank bonds, is high, as they enjoy a more favourable tax regime BIS Review 15/2006 3 
than deposits. Full advantage is not being taken of the portfolio diversification that professional managers can provide. Banks continue to play a crucial role, both because the level of direct intermediation is still high and because the major banking groups include management companies that control almost the entire investment fund market. This market therefore contributes decisively to the size and profitability of banks, which accordingly have a strategic interest in increasing its competitiveness. Management companies distribute their products almost exclusively through the networks of the group they belong to. This vertically integrated model enabled the Italian investment fund industry to grow rapidly, households to rely on relationships of trust with their banks when turning to asset management services, and banks to diversify their sources of income. Asset management offers Italian banks considerable scope for expanding their business, increasing their profits and improving their stock market ratios. However, in a fast-changing competitive environment, this will require appropriate strategies for both products and customer relations. The reliance on a captive market and the small size of most asset managers are not conducive to innovation or economies of scale, which are crucial to competitiveness and profitability in this sector. Foreign competitors are gaining ground in the Italian market, especially as regards innovative products; more than 85 per cent of the exchange traded funds listed by Borsa Italiana are managed by foreign groups. The independence of asset managers whether it is the result of decisions regarding their ownership or of strict corporate governance rules is essential not only for their growth but also to resolve the conflicts of interest inherent in their relationships with their parent banks. 5. Financial regulation The large proportion of savings not entrusted to professional investors, the scale of households’ investment in financial products and the growing complexity of the financial instruments available require the authorities to refine supervisory regulations and practices constantly. The law on the protection of savings recently approved by Parliament strengthens some of the safeguards for investors. The division of responsibilities between the Bank of Italy and Consob has always been based on the distinction between safeguarding the stability of intermediaries on the one hand and protecting investors and supervising markets on the other. This distinction, essential for effective action and the clear attribution of responsibilities, requires cooperation among the authorities in drawing up rules, in verifying intermediaries’ compliance and in promoting investors’ financial education. The Bank of Italy stands ready to continue this cooperation. Regulation of the markets cannot eliminate risks for investors, nor should it; what it should do is facilitate their allocation by enhancing transparency and limiting and managing conflicts of interest, with a view to protecting the weakest investors. This is necessary on grounds of both efficiency and fairness. In preparing laws and regulations, every effort must be made, with the assistance of the operators involved, to strike a better balance between pursuing objectives and containing the costs borne by issuers, intermediaries and investors. Without breaching the key principle of the distinction between functions, the Bank of Italy verifies intermediaries’ compliance with the rules for the protection of savings. Irregular or over-aggressive conduct exposes intermediaries to legal and reputational risks, which need to be addressed by prudential supervision. The management of both old and new banking risks is now set to reap the benefits of the substantial investments that have been made by banks and regulatory authorities to bring the Basel Accord into operation. The new regime creates incentives for banks to direct their choices towards the objectives of prudential supervision, enhances the effectiveness of the rules and reduces their distortionary effects under a highly innovative approach. Based on the risk management techniques of the most sophisticated banks, it will promote competition and significantly improve the quality of most banks’ operations.  The Accord could become the model for the regulation of investment firms and insurance companies as well. The convergence of the three sectors of financial intermediation should reduce the risk of regulatory arbitrage and rationalize the management of financial conglomerates. The supervisory review process, the second pillar of the Basel Accord, requires each bank to make its own assessment, which should also be forwardlooking, of the capital considered adequate in relation to its specific features, its risk exposures not considered for the minimum capital requirements and the 4 BIS Review 15/2006 
quality of its organization. It is up to the supervisory authorities to examine, discuss and approve the systems adopted. Using the analysis of different scenarios and stress tests, this instrument can also serve to link supervisory authorities’ micro- and macro-prudential assessments, by exploiting the wealth of theoretical and empirical models available. But we must aim higher, taking the opportunity offered by the Basel 2 system to arrive at a significant simplification of today’s supervisory rules and practices. The law on the protection of savings expressly provides for the periodic review of legislation, to check its compliance with the principle of proportionality between the objectives and the costs borne by supervised entities, and for the assessment of the impact of each new provision. These are reasonable and useful criteria, to which we must add that of achieving a high degree of convergence among European countries on supervisory rules and practices, a goal whose importance increases with the number of banking groups operating in more than one national market. 6. The Italian banking system Good laws and efficient supervision are what public institutions can and must contribute to the strengthening of the Italian banking industry, to the benefit of the country’s economic growth. The Italian banking system has made significant progress in recent years. There has been a general increase in productivity. The quality of banks’ assets has improved considerably despite the weakness of the economy. The majority of banks have capital in excess of the minimum requirement. The leading groups have completed complex organizational integration and rationalization plans in the wake of mergers, with substantial cost reductions. The positive outlook depends on an improvement in net interest income, which is likely to follow as the European economy picks up, on continued growth in lending, especially corporate loans and consumer credit, and on realization of the major opportunities for synergy afforded by consolidation at the national level. The efficiency gains have been reflected in profitability and market sentiment, which has responded favourably to dividend policies. The smaller banks have consolidated their positions in local markets, exploiting their comparative advantage in lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. The European takeover-bid directive, which provides for minimum harmonization, leaves it up to national governments to decide on any further convergence of their laws and regulations and to set the course towards greater or lesser contestability of ownership. The present situation is unsatisfactory because it leaves open the possibility that cross-border consolidation will be undertaken not only on the basis of criteria of industrial and financial advantage but also for reasons of regulatory arbitrage. Opening the markets for credit and banking services to domestic and foreign competition in conditions of regulatory equality reconciles the private interests of shareholders with the general interest in an efficient allocation of resources. It is the most effective way to stimulate further gains in operational and allocative efficiency, innovation, cost reductions and improvements in the quality of the services supplied to firms and households. To exploit these opportunities, including by means of mergers and acquisitions, capital is available on a scale that was unthinkable until recently. Protectionism leading to worse regulatory arrangements than today’s would entail costs on a comparable scale. We must avoid such an outcome. Hopefully, a rational and constructive spirit will prevail and interest in a level playing field for financial markets quickly re-emerge in the deliberations of the Heads of State and Government and Finance Ministers of the European Union. 7. Closing remarks Italy continues to benefit little from the favourable developments in world trade and international finance. In 2005 GDP stagnated, exports continued to lose market share, the budget deficit widened. Since the 1990s the economy has been as if bogged down. Cyclical indicators and the short- and medium-term predictions of the main forecasting institutions now point to a pick-up in Italian GDP, but with growth still less than the potential, which is already lower than in the other major countries.  The growth gap reflects Italian industry’s difficulty in competing. This is rooted in the lack of improvement in productivity. In other countries the revolution in production sparked by information and BIS Review 15/2006 5 
communications technology has produced its full effects: firms have adapted their human and organizational capital to the new technologies. Italy has been slow to seize the opportunities of this revolution. The gap is widest in total factor productivity. New players are coming onto the stage, formidable in Asia but also present in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. This has imparted an extraordinary impulse to world trade. It is a great opportunity for growth but also a major challenge, in the face of which Italy has stumbled. With the end of the illusory remedy of competitive devaluations, productivity growth is the only possible way to achieve prosperity, to create a solid, sustainable foundation for wage increases, and to ensure the development of the country, for ourselves and for future generations. The structural lags of the Italian economy are not the signs of inevitable decline. They are manifestations of problems that are profound and serious but that can be overcome. We need to devise lasting solutions and explain them clearly to the public. This week the European Central Bank raised its key rates by a quarter of a point. The time available for the adjustment of the public finances and a return to growth is running out. Savings, one of the strengths of our economy and our society, are an essential ingredient for growth. It is up to the financial system, markets and intermediaries, to channel them towards the most productive uses, acting in a fully competitive environment and in compliance with the rules. This is your –and our – responsibility. 6 BIS Review 15/2006 
Amando M Tetangco, Jr: Towards a shared vision for capital market reforms Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, at the Testimonial Luncheon of the AB Capital and Investment Corporation, Makati City, 1 March 2006. *      *      * Distinguished directors, officers and staff of the AB Capital and Investment Corporation led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ramon R. Del rosario, Jr.; President and Chief Operating Officer Francis M. Varela; former President Filomeno G. Francisco; ladies and gentlemen: Good afternoon!  Congratulations on your 25th year anniversary! It is indeed an honor for me to join all of you today as you celebrate this momentous occasion.  For more than two decades, AB Capital and Investment Corporation has positioned itself as a prominent player in the capital market industry. Specifically, you have carved your place in corporate finance, fixed-income securities dealership, stock brokerage and fund management. You also hold a creditable track record in equity and debt securities underwriting, having acted as issue manager and/or lead underwriter for several of the country’s most prestigious and most successful debt and equity offerings. It’s no wonder you have earned various local and international distinctions for your financial savvy backed by a solid financial standing, as well as for your significant contributions to capital market development.  I am positive that you owe much of this success to the competence and foresight of your leaders and the dedication and zeal of your workforce.  In the pursuit of your institutional aspirations, you also have significantly contributed to our shared goal of promoting stability and efficiency in the Philippine financial system for a sustainable economic growth. In return, let me take this opportunity to share with you our continuing reform initiatives which could be useful guideposts in fine-tuning your chosen path.  The economy at a glance  To put things in perspective, let me start with an overview of the economy.  In 2005, the economy proved its resilience and fundamental strength, despite the prevailing difficult macroeconomic conditions.  The country’s economic performance is benefiting directly from improving fiscal discipline and sound monetary policies.  For 2006, we expect to keep the momentum going. We realize, of course, that sustaining economic growth over the long term would depend, to a large extent, on the resilience of the financial system which forms the backbone of the economy. Thus, we are taking parallel actions on key fronts.  The promotion of a sound and stable financial system is the centerpiece of this agenda. Within this framework, the development of the Philippine capital market is being given high priority alongside the continuous reform of the banking system.  Capital market initiatives  Already underway is a series of reforms in the Philippine capital market intended to: create a sound market infrastructure, enhance transparency and market discipline mechanisms, promote greater investor protection, and strengthen the legal and regulatory framework.  Toward this end, the following are some of our key contributions: BIS Review 15/2006 1 
Delivery of securities  In July 2003, the BSP issued regulations mandating the proper delivery of securities by dealer banks and non-banks to the investor. This is meant to promote transparency and discourage proliferation of manipulative practices. Accreditation of third party custodians  The BSP subsequently issued regulations on the pre-qualification criteria for banks and NBFIs that will operate as securities custodians and defined the functions and responsibilities of each. It is important that we develop the custodian as an important agent in the capital market that can facilitate the lending and borrowing of securities. Market infrastructures  The BSP also supported private sector-led initiatives to establish a fixed income exchange (fie) intended to improve the current market infrastructure. The fie centralizes trading of securities for enhanced transparency and efficient price discovery.  At present, transparent pricing has been achieved for the interdealer market, as quotations are available on a per security basis, and executions are at the best bid and offer. In the future, we hope to see efficient price discovery for the common investor in the public market phase, as price and trading data will be made available on a timely basis.  Expansion of the menu of financial products  The domestic capital market remains shallow and underdeveloped. In response, the BSP has issued various circulars diversifying the menu of financial products available in the capital market. Traded papers like unsecured subordinated debts (as tier 2 supplementary capital), long-term negotiable certificates of deposits or LTNCDs, documented repos, and securitization structures create market-oriented opportunities for banks and other players and deepen the capital market. Recently, we have issued circular 503, amending the guidelines on risk-based capital framework to include Hybrid Tier I instruments as part of qualifying capital. Hybrid capital instruments that have equity-like features enable them to absorb losses similar to common equity. However, these instruments must be perpetual and redeemable by the issuer subject to prior BSP approval.  Moreover, we have also started revitalizing the trust business to widen investor base with the gradual phase out of Common Trust Fund (CTF) for a better product called Unit Investment Trust Fund (UITF). Uitfs enhance the credibility of pooled funds to investors as the value of investments is mark-to-market, paving the way for long-term investment opportunities. Credit rating agencies  We are encouraging the entry of more rating agencies. Rating agencies play an important role in guiding investors towards informed decision-making and in ensuring the proper disclosure of investment information. Accordingly, we have issued circulars which set the criteria for accreditation of domestic and international credit rating agencies. To date, the BSP has authorized one domestic credit rating agency to issue ratings for bank supervisory purposes. Likewise, we have recognized one internationally accepted credit rating agency with a representative office in the Philippines to undertake local or national credit ratings.  Legal and regulatory framework  We are also advocating the passage of key legislative measures that will spur the development of the capital market and strengthen the regulatory framework.  A key priority is the approval of the extension of the Special Purpose Vehicle (sPV) law for another two years to complete the cleanup of Non-Performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system and restore credit supply to the economy.  2 BIS Review 15/2006 
Following a succession of asset dispositions under SPV I, Bnks’ NPL/NPA ratios declined to single-digit levels. As of end-December 2005, NPL/NPA ratio of the commercial banking system stood at 8.5 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.1  We will also continue to lobby for the enactment of the credit information system act that will establish a central credit information system for improved discipline in the credit process. Credit bureaus will be able to serve as a reliable source of information to allow lenders to accurately evaluate risks and select between creditworthy and poor-quality borrowers.  Another vital legislation is the Revised Investment Company Act (RICA) that will establish a comprehensive regulatory framework to enable investment companies to play a key role in capital formation. Moreover, this bill is aimed at protecting the interests of the investing public by preventing the misuse of customer funds.  Other legislative measures that we would like to see enacted in the near term are the Personal Equity Retirement Account (PERA), the Pre-Need Code and the Corporate Recovery Act.  With these reforms in various stages of implementation and others more that are in the pipeline, we can expect better prospects for the growth of the Philippine capital market.  Undoubtedly, the continuing support of all financial industry players will ensure for us greater success in this endeavor.  As a final note, I call on you to assist us in fostering an environment conducive to a vibrant domestic capital market. You are, undoubtedly, one of the major players in the capital market today. We will be relying on your experience in helping provide order and depth in the market.  Although the road ahead is considerably tough, I am confident that AB Capital - armed with vision, a strong resolve and with sound leadership at the helm - will be more than prepared to meet the challenge.  Let us all do our share in responding to the call for building a deep, dynamic and liquid capital market - a precondition for achieving sustainable economic growth.  Once again, happy anniversary and I wish you all more success in the years to come!                                                       1  Comparatively lower than the 12.7 percent NPL ratio and 11.4 percent NPA ratio as of end-December 2004.

Amando M Tetangco Jr: Outlook on the country's economic condition and the role of information technology to uplift economic growth Speech by Mr Amando M Tetangco, Jr, Governor of the Central Bank of the Philippines, at the Induction of Officers of the Philippines Electronics and Telecommunications Federation, Inc. (PETEF) and the Information Technology Association of the Philippines (ITAP), Makati, 13 March 2006. *      *      * Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I am honored and pleased to be a part of tonight’s event - the joint membership meeting and induction of the officers of the Philippine Electronics and Telecommunications Federation, Inc. (PETEF) and the Information Technology Association of the Philippines (ITAP). Congratulations to all of you. Special thanks should go to Miss Cynthia Mammon, ITAP’s indefatiguable Director and Chair for Events, whose persistence in finding a suitable schedule for us has caused my being here tonight possible. Your two organizations, under the leadership of your presidents, Mr. Renato Garcia for PETEF and Ms. Dittas Formosa for ITAP, together, play a pivotal role in the fulfillment of the government’s thrust to harness the benefits of the phenomenal improvements in Information and Communications Technology or ICT.  Information has always played a vital role in our history. Society has used information to gain a more accurate picture of any situation it is in, make better decisions for the future, and improve the quality of life in general. But never before has information been more accessible than it is now.  To illustrate, let me quote Bill Clinton, the 42nd President of the United States speaking at the announcement of their Next Generation Initiative in 1996. Mr. Clinton said, “When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the world wide web… Now even my cat has its own page!”. That, was only a little over 10 years ago. Since then computers have progressively become smaller, more powerful, and more affordable. We are now linked by cell phones, fiber optic cables, the internet, and and satellites. One can access information about almost anything (even about Bill Clinton’s cat) with just the flick of a button. Increased accessibility of information as we are now experiencing, however, is not the end. Information and the manner in which it is disseminated must be employed for useful, productive purposes and attuned to economic development. Objective For tonight, I would like to begin by situating us in terms of the monetary, external and banking sectors of the economy. Then I would like to make a few suggestions for areas where I believe ICT can be most useful in the context of these sectors of the economy. Business outlook Based on the most recent business and consumer surveys of the BSP, both the business sector and the households continue to be positive on the economy and anticipate better times ahead for us. The sustained appreciation of the peso, lower interest rates and the improved fiscal position as well as the favorable employment conditions here and abroad are reasons cited by the business sector for its confidence and Filipino household for their heightened willingness to consume more. On the inflation front - the February inflation rate of 7.6 percent, although higher than the January figure, is within the BSP’s forecast range for the month. Thus, the rate is still consistent with our projected path for inflation, which shows a decelerating trend beginning the second half of 2006. This and the prevailing conditions in the economy have provided a room for the BSP to keep its policy rates steady during last week’s policy rate setting meeting. Now moving on to an area, which I know everyone has a keen interest in – the peso. Our outlook for that continues to also be positive, given that the underlying sentiment prevailing in the market remains constructive, arising from the sustained healthy economic fundamentals and the successful implementation of key economic reforms. These improvements in the external sector have allowed us BIS Review 23/2006 1 
to build up the country’s gross international reserves to over USD 20 billion for the first two months of the year, which is sufficient to cover 4.3 months of imports of goods and payments of services. On the banking sector – we continue to push towards the clean up of banks’ balance sheets. The latest NPL ratio of banks remains at single digit level, 8.4 percent. In addition, we continue to pursue the extension of the SPV Law that will enable banks to further off-load non-performing assets to the market. Role of Information Technology to uplift economic growth. Given this upbeat scenario, what role do I see for ICT in fostering economic growth? E-reportorial requirements Let me begin with the banking sector. Since the enactment of the e-commerce law in 1999, the BSP has taken to task the promotion of electronic transations. We began by simplifying bank reporting and providing guidelines for the electronic transmission of the same to the BSP. We have systems in place for the electronic transmission of reports to us not only by the big commercial banks but the thrift and rural banks as well. In order to better appreciate the reports and data gathered from the banks and utilize these to supervise them in a more proactive way, the BSP embarked on a data warehousing project. To fully automate the project, the BSP is procuring an integrated financial reporting portal system that will allow BSP-supervised banks to send/upload reports to BSP and retrieve/download processed reports from BSP using mutually acceptable secured channels of communication. Reaching out to the rural areas An area that your association may be of help to us in this regard is encouraging through your education campaigns and drives the smaller thrift and rural banks to be more e-savvy. There are over 700 rural banks scattered all over the country but only about half have email facilities and about the same number have in-house developed systems. You may want to consider e-enabling the regional areas as there is already a heavy concentration of applications in the mega-metro manila area and other major cities. For the BSP’s part we developed the “Integrated Regional Information System” (IRIS) which allows the branches of banks in the countryside to conduct electronic transactions with BSP such as cash deposit, withdrawal, FX purchase, peso exchange, and rediscounting of loans and payments. IRIS has been implemented in three BSP regional offices and 5 regional units, and is expected to be fully deployed in the remaining BSP branches by the 3rd quarter of 2006. IT risk management With the increasing applications of technology to banking services comes increased exposure of banks to technology-related risks, including operational, reputational, and strategic risks. To help mitigate these, the BSP recently put out guidelines for technology risk management. The BSP established these guidelines to ensure that the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and effectively measure, monitor and control these risks are in place.  Anti-money laundering efforts In addition to risk management, you may also partner with financial institutions in the anti-money laundering efforts of the government. Under the Anti Money Laundering Act, as amended (AMLA), covered institutions, i.e., financial institutions that are supervised by the BSP, the SEC and the Insurance Commission, are required to electronically report to the AMLC all “covered and suspicious transactions”. While the AMLC has established its own Monitoring and Analysis Systems (TMAS) to receive, analyze and store all prescribed e-reports to the AMLC, banks still hold all the other necessary information on their clients beyond the reporting requirements of AMLC. Covered financial institutions may be looking for partners to assist them in developing systems that will create an environment which would institutionalize red flag indicators for suspicious transactions, and thus facilitate not only their reporting to AMLC, but also their own internal surveillance requirements. 2 BIS Review 23/2006 
These are just some of the recent undertakings in the banking and financial sector where you may find that your collective expertise as associations could be employed. Business opportunities: e-marketing I mentioned at the beginning of my talk that the BSP’s recent surveys show optimism from both the consumer and business sides of the economy. Your associations should be able to build on that. I sincerely believe that the optimism in these sectors, and in the marketplace in general, is getting more deeply entrenched. And you should harness that. A particular advocacy of the BSP is micro-finance. Recently, because of the good repayment experience of banks from micro-finance lending, banks have increased exposure to this segment of borrowers. The extension of loans for micro-finance has ceased to be the monopoly of thrift and rural banks, as the big commercial banks are now finding out that lending to micro-finance and SME’s is very profitable. You have a great role to play here. You can connect the artisans and cottage industries to the market place. An example of this successful use of the ICT as cited by the United Nations is a Filipino website, Global Echo, which sells not only quilts and blankets woven by women in the rural areas, but also teaches other developing countries to use the internet to become more self-sufficient and eliminate middlemen in reaching their markets. There are many other similar applications where you could partner with financial institutions. Conclusion As I have painted a positive picture of the economy to you, I challenge you here tonight to maximize the benefits of Informtion and Communication Technology, by e-enabling a greater part of our nation, reaching out not only to the obvious and traditional markets but enlarging your scope.  Your associations, more than any other, know that the government cannot do everything. We need partners that can assist us not only directly through the areas that I have outlined before, but also indirectly through the crafting of enabling laws that would foster an environment that would encourage ICT to flourish positively.  Let me end with a quote from noted author, Sir Arthur Clarke, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Ladies and gentlemen, I am excited to see that time when we would have fully seized the benefits of information technology, for then it would be truly “magical”. Once again, my warm congratulations to the officers of PETEF and ITAP. Magandang gabi po sa inyo at mabuhay tayong lahat. BIS Review 23/2006 3 
Philipp Hildebrand: Global economic prospects and key challenges for monetary policy Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Money Market Event, Zurich, 23 March 2006. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch) *      *      * Summary Current economic developments are basically in line with the SNB’s expectations. Global economic activity is robust and the outlook is bright. The SNB expects broad-based growth of over 2% for 2006 and a moderate rate of inflation of approximately 1%.  In addition to the usual economic risks, monetary policy today is faced with three key challenges. First, the effects of globalisation on inflation must be anticipated. Second, the way in which the interaction between globalisation and an ample supply of liquidity affects the price development of several assets needs to be analysed. The SNB's monetary policy concept enables it to take a long-term view and to recognise possible distortions early on. Third, identifying the neutral interest rate has become more difficult in today's environment. Many factors tend to support a lower neutral interest rate, while others would support a higher neutral rate.  Against this background, the SNB will continue the gradual normalisation of its monetary policy. The scale and timing of this normalisation process will depend on further economic developments. Owing to a favourable inflation trend and well-anchored inflation expectations, we are in a position to cautiously approach a neutral interest rate level. BIS Review 23/2006 1 
Svein Gjedrem: Norwegian experiences in balancing economic development with macroeconomic stability - a historical perspective Speech by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), at the Norwegian Embassy, New Dehli, 21 March 2006.  The  Charts in pdf-format can be found on the Norges Bank’s website. The speech does not contain assessments of the economic situation or the monetary stance. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation.  *      *      * Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is a great honour to address you today on behalf of Norges Bank. The ties between Norway and India seem to be growing stronger, in spite of the geographical distance and vast differences between our two countries. Over the last few years, a number of Norwegian companies have entered the Indian market or strengthened their involvement in India. For example, the Norwegian oil and gas company Norsk Hydro reports that almost 300 000 hours of engineering services for the natural gas field Ormen Lange were supplied by Indian engineers, located in India. Last year, the Government Pension Fund made its first investments in the Indian stock market. By the end of 2005, the Fund had holdings in more than 70 Indian companies. There are also numerous cultural ties. This year, Norway is commemorating our most famous playwright Henrik Ibsen. A wide range of events is being arranged both in Norway and abroad. Of particular interest is that Indian actors are providing fresh interpretations of Ibsen’s work, both in India and in Norway.  The topic of my speech today is Norwegian experiences in balancing economic development with macroeconomic stability from a historical perspective. As a background for the subject, let me start with a brief characteristic of Norway today from an economic perspective.  First, Norway is a small, mountainous country with a population of only 4½ million people scattered across a land area that is one tenth of the size of India. Second, Norway’s economic growth has been favourable for many years, and the per capita income is among the highest in the world. An abundance of natural resources, not least oil and gas, and openness to trade and capital movements are important reasons for this. The petroleum sector’s share of GDP was approximately 24 per cent in 2005. Over the last 10 years, the government has earned higher petroleum revenues than it has spent. Today we have a sizeable Government Pension Fund, which invests all its funds globally.  Globalisation and cyclical developments have been kind to the Norwegian economy. Prices for our imported goods are falling in relation to prices for goods we export. Norway’s terms of trade are improving. The impact of the rise in oil and gas prices is particularly strong, but the terms-of-trade gains for the mainland economy have also been high. One aspect of this is that trade in services with India is increasing.  Petroleum and luck is, however, not the whole story behind the high per capita income in Norway. We have also been successful in seizing the opportunities that have been offered by changing international environments. The foundations for the Norwegian welfare state were established some two hundred years back in history.  Long-term economic developments The Napoleonic Wars, which tormented Europe in the early 19th century, brought some great changes to the face of Europe. Norway took this opportunity to adopt a constitution and establish a number of central governmental institutions, including a central bank.  Norway was severely hit by the economic crisis that followed the war, and around 1820 Norway’s GDP per capita was lower than in many comparable countries. In the second half of the 1820s, a new period of economic expansion started. The upturn gathered momentum from the middle of the century. An event which had a considerable impact on Norwegian shipping and economic history took place in 1849 when England repealed all navigation acts regulating the right to transport goods to and from England and its colonies.  BIS Review 22/2006 1 
This new and more competition-friendly trade environment spurred a rapid build-up of the Norwegian commercial fleet. Norway suddenly became a major exporter of services. As the chart shows, the tonnage of the Norwegian commercial fleet increased almost six-fold from 1850 to 1880. By 1880, Norway had built up the world’s third largest commercial fleet.  In the latter part of the 1800s, Norway benefited greatly from free trade and free capital movements and became a relatively prosperous country. Access to international technology, competence and capital were important when the first industrial base was established in the late 19th century. The banking sector also expanded rapidly in this period.  As this chart shows, value added in manufacturing and services became more important and increased as a share of total GDP. Employment and value added in agriculture, fisheries etc., on the other hand, declined markedly. By the beginning of the 20th century, the standard of living in Norway did not lag behind that of other European countries. This change in industry structure is necessary and lies at the heart of economic development.  The second half of the 19th century also represents a golden age for Norwegian cultural development, with the literature of Henrik Ibsen, the music of Edvard Grieg and later the paintings of Edvard Munch.  In the period preceding the First World War, the world experienced a period of strong growth in trade and cross-border capital flows. There were few political barriers and major technological advances fostered growth in trade. Prosperity increased. But this period was interrupted, and in the interwar period protectionism gained ground, with trade barriers and a contraction in international trade. This was combined with deep economic recessions.  Economic policy after the Second World War  After the Second World War, a strong belief evolved in Norway that the economy could be controlled and steered in the desired direction. The support for a market economy lost ground after the recessions and financial instability in the interwar period. Economic policy was marked by coordination, control and regulation. At the same time, Norway took part in international organisations. International organisations made an effort to promote economic cooperation and increased integration of international trade and fixed investment. Trade barriers were gradually scaled back and trade picked up already in the 1950s. Capital movements remained strongly regulated, however.  Maintenance of a high level of fixed capital formation in inter alia infrastructure and private and public industrial companies was an important part of economic policy after the war. The fixed investment-to-GDP ratio stayed at a historically high level until the late 1970s. On the other hand, low or negative real interest rates, combined with credit regulation, contributed to a low return to capital and an inefficient use of resources. Since the late 1970s, the investment ratio has declined in Norway as in many other European countries. India, on the other hand, is in the process of catching up. High investment growth in infrastructure as well as in businesses is probably important to maintain high economic growth in India.  The government sector in Norway increased in importance until the beginning of the 1990s. Taxes were raised to support increased use of resources in the public service sector and to support a rising level of transfers between households and industries.  The regulatory economic policy in the post-war period was, however, not sustainable. This policy was at the root of many of the problems that followed in the 1970s and 1980s. Today’s formulation of economic policy reflects the experience gained and the lessons learned in these two decades.  The economic policy contributed to wide fluctuations in the Norwegian economy. Inflation became high and variable. This was largely due to a perception in the 1960s and 1970s that strong growth and low unemployment could be achieved if we were only willing to accept somewhat higher inflation. But it was gradually recognised that there was no such trade-off.  The absence of a nominal anchor was one of the main reasons behind the pronounced swings in the Norwegian economy. With a policy of low interest rates and devaluations, inflation took root. Nominal interest rates were kept at a low level even though inflation rose. Frequent devaluations from 1976 were unable in the long term to prevent a decline in the manufacturing sector. On the contrary, they proved to be self-reinforcing. The wide fluctuations culminated in a credit boom in the mid-1980s.  The fluctuations were reinforced by oil price shocks and the use of expected revenues from oil production. The government began already in the 1970s to budget on the basis of future strong growth 2 BIS Review 22/2006 
in petroleum revenues. The result was that we spent a large share of our petroleum wealth in the 1970s and 1980s. Welfare schemes were expanded significantly. Manufacturing industry was scaled back. The recession after the credit bubble burst and oil prices fell in 1986 was deep. The recession was deeper than would have been the case if we had maintained a larger and competitive manufacturing sector. Norwegian industry lost export market shares in the late 1980s in spite of the booming conditions abroad and substantial capacity slack at home.  It was recognised that a substantial revision of economic policy would be necessary and that the problems created by inflation had to be taken seriously. The exchange rate was chosen as the nominal anchor in 1986. A fixed exchange rate was an intermediate target for achieving low and stable inflation. Inflation fell gradually to 2-3 per cent in 1991-1992.  We had to abandon the fixed exchange rate policy in 1992. An important reason was the weakness inherent in the fixed exchange rate regime in a world with free capital flows and deep financial markets. The krone exchange rate showed, however, little change to begin with and rapidly found a new range.  A formal inflation target for monetary policy was introduced in the spring of 2001. The operational target of monetary policy as defined by the government is inflation of close to 2.5 per cent over time. Many countries had already gained many years’ experience in operating such a system. New Zealand was the first in line towards the end of the 1980s. Canada followed shortly thereafter.  Developments over the past 40 years illustrate that the most important contribution monetary policy can make to sound economic developments in the long term is low and stable inflation. This provides the economy with a nominal anchor.  Low and stable inflation makes it easier for economic agents to distinguish changes in relative prices from changes in the general price level. Prices become a more accurate information vehicle. Through the 1990s, inflation generally remained in the interval 1½ – 3½ per cent.  When there is confidence in the inflation target, monetary policy can also contribute to stabilising output and employment.  Norges Bank operates a flexible inflation targeting regime, so that weight is given to both variability in inflation and variability in output and employment in interest-rate setting. In order to make forecasts for inflation and output, we must also judge how interest rates will develop in the future. If inflation deviates substantially from the target for a period, the interest rate will be set with a view to returning it gradually to the target, so that we avoid substantial variations in output and employment. This chart illustrates the judgement as published in the latest Inflation Report.  Past experience indicates that expectations as to future inflation remain stable even if inflation varies somewhat as long as the interest rate is used actively to curb the effects. Monetary policy cannot fine-tune economic developments, but it can prevent the largest effects from occurring when the economy is exposed to disturbances. In some situations, it may be appropriate to take into account particularly unfavourable developments.  In a period of increased cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, changes in competitive conditions and new trading patterns, Norway may, with our very open economy, have to accept somewhat greater variation in inflation and deviations from the target, as we have witnessed over the past two to three years.  Challenges in an oil economy Petroleum revenues pose as mentioned special challenges to stabilisation policy. The experience of other countries that had received large, unexpected income from natural resources was not encouraging. The classic example is Spain’s substantial revenues from the colonisation of America in the 1600s. The historian David Landes1 summarised the Spanish experience as follows:  Landes stated that easy money is bad for a country. It is very tempting to live comfortably on this income and be less concerned about safeguarding other revenue sources. In that case, the country is poorly poised to cope with an end to easy money.                                                        1  David Landes (1998): The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, W.W. Norton & Company, Inc., N.Y. BIS Review 22/2006 3 
The oil age in Norway has spanned 30 years and it appears that it will continue for many years ahead. Petroleum activities give Norway an economic base that is not available to many other countries. But it also presents us with many challenges.  First, petroleum wealth is part of Norway’s national wealth. It is misleading to look upon the cash flow from petroleum activities as income. The appropriate economic perspective is to see the transfer of the cash flow to the Government Pension Fund as a way of transferring capital from one account to another – from petroleum to foreign securities. By doing so, we diversify risk. We must also strive for an equitable distribution of this wealth across generations.  The Norwegian authorities have been successful in ensuring that the bulk of petroleum wealth benefits society as a whole. Both the state’s ownership interests through the State’s Direct Financial Interest in petroleum activities (SDFI) and the tax system have contributed. The companies that extract oil earn a reasonable return on their investments and have incentives to invest, but the economic rent has essentially accrued to the general public.  Second, the size of the cash flow from petroleum activities also varies. If petroleum revenues were to be used as they accrue, this would lead to wide fluctuations in demand in the Norwegian economy.  Third, the use of petroleum revenues has an impact on competitiveness in Norwegian business and industry. A high level and substantial variations in the use of petroleum revenues would have a negative impact on internationally exposed industries.  The establishment of the Government Pension Fund and the spending guidelines for petroleum revenues are intended to meet these challenges.  The government earns large net cash flows deriving from the oil companies’ sale of petroleum products in foreign markets. The Pension Fund serves as a buffer between current petroleum revenues and spending these revenues in the Norwegian economy. All central government revenues from petroleum operations shall be transferred to the Fund.  According to the fiscal rule that has been approved by the Norwegian parliament, petroleum revenue spending shall be limited to 4 per cent or the expected annual real return on the Pension Fund over time. This partly insulates the economy from fluctuations in oil prices and extraction rates in the petroleum sector – and when followed it ensures that revenue spending in the Norwegian economy is at a level that can be sustained over time. The difference between the net cash flow and spending is reinvested in foreign financial markets.  The Petroleum Fund also functions as a buffer and dampens the wide fluctuations in the krone exchange rate that petroleum revenues might otherwise have generated. Operators in the foreign exchange market may at times have a tendency to underestimate the Fund’s function as a stabilisation mechanism. The capital outflows through the Fund contribute to both curbing the appreciation of the krone and maintaining its stability.  At the end of 2005, the market value of the Pension Fund’s portfolio was roughly 73 per cent of GDP. As shown in the chart, the value of the Fund is rising rapidly and may continue to do so in the years ahead. The Fund is now approaching the nominal value of one year’s GDP and may reach two in the course of the next decade.  On the other hand, Norway, like many other countries, is facing substantial fiscal challenges. Financing the large pension payments that will have to be disbursed in the coming years will be very demanding.  Final remarks To sum up, Norway has a market economy and a large government sector. The way in which economic policy is oriented today reflects the knowledge gained and the lessons learned.  We know from experience that fiscal policy alone cannot ensure a high level of employment. The structure of the labour market and wage formation are probably of greater importance. The direct regulation of credit, interest rates and capital movements collapsed and was phased out in the 1980s. Price regulation no longer plays a role as a macroeconomic instrument. The scope of business policy has become more general.  4 BIS Review 22/2006 
The most important contribution monetary policy can make to sound economic developments in the long term is low and stable inflation. Low and stable inflation has contributed to solid growth in the global economy in recent years.  Thank you for your attention.  BIS Review 22/2006 5 
Ivan Iskrov: Financial progress and prospects Speech by Mr Ivan Iskrov, Governor of the Bulgarian National Bank, at the Sixth Business Roundtable with the Government of Bulgaria, Sofia, 21 March 2006. *      *      * Dear Minister Oresharski, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to participate together with the Minister of Finance in this panel event dedicated to the financial development and prospects of this country’s economy. Based on the statutory division of labour between the Central Bank Governor and the Finance Minister on the one hand, and between the Central Bank and the Government on the other, in my speech I will deal mainly with the issues relating to the country’s external position, the development of bank lending and inflation, and the impact these variables have on the BNB’s policy. I would like to immediately underscore that these issues cannot be discussed, outside the context of economic growth prospects, the accession of our country to the EU, and the trends of development in world economy. For better understanding of Bulgarian economy in the recent years, several global trends influencing significantly the development of our economy should be highlighted. Firstly, the dominance of the principle of free trade and the liberalization of capital movement, combined with the investors’ increasing propensity to hold assets issued by third country residents, brought about the on-going growth of international trade and exchange of capital. In such an environment, where domestic demand is no longer restricted within the amount of the current national income, the current account deficits are not always an indicator of fundamental imbalances. As has been emphasized by an increasing number of scientists, central bankers, and finance ministers, the imbalanced external accounts of individual countries have become rather the rule than an exception (A. Greenspan, M. King). In addition, empirical research, as well as the European institutions (European Central Bank, European Commission) point out that the process of convergence is inevitably accompanied by current account deficits. Secondly, the decrease in the long-term interest rates in the developed economies, and the accompanying reduction in the risk premiums in the developing economies, resulted in investors’ pursuit of higher yield in the developing markets. There are multiple factors determining these developments, on which I would not focus today. What should be underscored is that these global trends channel significant in amount capital flows to the developing economies. Irrespective of the monetary policy regime (fixed or floating exchange rate), the absorption of larger capital inflows inevitably puts the monetary authorities to trial. To illustrate the large scale of this process, I will give Bulgaria as an example, where the capital inflow (in the form of direct investment and debt) was 1.5% of GDP in 1998, and in the recent two years it approximates 15% of GDP. Thirdly, the significant and long-lasting growth since 2003 in the prices of oil and other energy resources considerably contributed to the international imbalances, and more particularly to Bulgaria’s current account deficit. This process accounted for the considerable growth of the expenditures for imports of energy resources incurred by the importer countries, and for the enormous cash flows channeled to the exporting countries. For Bulgaria, these developments in energy resource prices resulted in an increase in the costs of import of such products from EUR 1.7 billion in 2002 (the year after which the process of sustainable oil price increase started) to almost EUR 3.0 billion in 2005. This trend was very strongly manifested in the past year, when the country’s expenditures for energy resource imports grew by 52% against 2004. These three global trends, in combination with the approaching full-fledged EU membership of our country, produce a unique environment that the Bulgarian economy has never before faced. This makes the analysis of the processes and economic policy decisionmaking very complex and difficult. As I have already noted, in the recent several years, enormous volumes of capital were channeled into the country, the banking system acting as the natural intermediary for the effective distribution of these resources. This is not surprising at all, given the successfully implemented privatization of the banking sector in Bulgaria. At present, over 80% of the Bulgarian banking sector is owned by foreign investors, the majority of which are from euro area countries. As a consequence of strong competition and the BIS Review 22/2006 1 
good investment prospects, the growth rate of lending to the private sector accelerated to levels of 48.6% at year end- 2004. The ratio of banking credit to GDP increased from 12.1% in 1999 to 45.0% at the end of 2005. Of course, this dynamics reflected to a great extent the process of convergence of the country’s economy, and in particular the degree of financial intermediation, to the levels evidenced in EU Member States (112% of GDP). At the same time, the central bank cannot help asking the question to what extent the quick growth of bank credit may result in potential risks for the financial and macroeconomic stability in the country. The BNB was to determine the moment, after which the convergence grows into a self-propelled process of struggling for a market share. Such a transition entails considerable risks, as it does not lead to sustainable growth rates of both financial intermediation and economic activity and employment. Therefore, since the beginning of 2004, the BNB started a process of phasing in measures (primarily prudential and administrative) aimed at slowing down bank credit growth to a sustainable level, which would not put to risk the stability of the economy. Data indicate the central bank’s policy resulted in a change in commercial banks’ behaviour and reduced the growth of bank lending to 32.4% at the end of 2005. In the current year, while sustaining the effect of already implemented measures, we expect banking credit to grow with a rate below or near 20%. As I mentioned earlier, the dynamics of banking intermediation in the country cannot be contemplated in isolation from the process of free movement of capital and the accompanying dynamics of the balance of payments current account. Intuitively, many economists tend to seek direct cause and effect relation between bank credit growth and the current account dynamics. They rely on the logic that the growth of banking intermediation increases the possibilities for consumption and investment, which combined with the existence of free trade and the slower response of domestic supply leads to the accumulation of external imbalances. Such reasoning is to a great extent rational, but it should not lead, as is clearly manifested in the BNB’s policy, to defining the simple rule that the balance of payments dynamics can be directly controlled through controlling the banking credit rates of growth. This clarification allows me to turn to the next issue I would like to discuss, namely the dynamics of the country’s external position. The stable macroeconomic environment in Bulgaria, plus the sustainably high rates of economic growth and the prospects for its membership in the EU brought in an increasing amount of investments. Their share in the GDP in the first three quarters of 2005 increased to 26.6%, which marks the highest level reached since the beginning of economic reforms in the country. The growth of investments and the concomitant improvement of employment, increase both the current incomes of households, and their expected future incomes, which is associated with increased consumption and decrease in the savings in the economy. As a consequence of these processes, the gap of the balance of payments current account widened to levels over 5% of GDP in 2003 and 2004, and further expanded to 11.9% as of end-2005. From the perspective of current account immediate dynamics, each economy faces the question if the current level of deficit or surplus is determined by structural factors, i.e. it is close to a balanced level, which can be maintained within a medium-term, or it is the consequence of unsustainable trends and one-off factors. Both groups of factors played an important role in the development of the current account deficit in 2005. First of all, the above-mentioned growth of investments was accompanied by considerable imports of investment goods. In 2005, the imports of this group of goods grew by 31.2%, while their share in the total structure of imports reached up to 28%. This trend was associated with a slow-down in the growth of imports of non-energy raw materials and consumer goods. In the current year, we expect the rate of import of investment goods to remain high, given the rapid pace of technological innovation of the economy, which is mainly accounted for by the forthcoming EU membership of our country. Multiple one-off factors had significant effect in the past year, which include the abrupt increase in the prices and volumes of oil imports, and the sweeping floods, which troubled our exports in the third quarter of the year. This year, the current account deficit is expected to drop below 11 % of GDP, mainly due to the slowed down growth of imports, and the recovery of exports growth, which has been evidenced since the last quarter of the previous year and the beginning of 2006. In January, the exports of goods increased by 27.5% on annual basis, and exports, excluding energy goods, increased by 17%. The continuing implementation of the reforms in the labour market and education, and the improvement of the business environment, including a significant improvement in the operation of the judiciary, are of key importance for maintaining competitive advantages and ensuring sustainability of the country’s external position, as well as preserving the interrelation between salary growth and productivity of labour. As we are well aware, the revenues from tourist services influence considerably the country’s balance of payments (15% of the country’s exports of goods and services in 2 BIS Review 22/2006 
2005), which necessitates the very fast elimination of all existing obstacles to the development of this industry. Before I conclude my presentation, I would like to focus on inflation dynamics. At first sight, this variable does not seem to be such a great challenge for us, compared to the issues discussed above. Looking at the prospects and having in mind the country’s strategy for expeditious accession to the euro area, however, this is a macroeconomic variable which faces the country with the greatest challenges. The inflation criterion, as defined in the Maastricht Treaty (this is not the place to deal with the issue how good this definition is), is very strict and requires a purposeful policy going beyond the monetary and fiscal policies. In Bulgaria’s case, under the currency regime of fixed exchange rate and extremely conservative fiscal policy, untapped prospects should be sought in encouraging competition and improving the business climate, thus ensuring to the economy the flexibility to respond to exogenous changes (including with regard to the prices of raw materials) and enabling supply to react more promptly to increases in demand (both domestic and external). In the past year, inflation reached 6.5 % under the strong proinflationary impact of the increase in the prices of energy resources (direct contribution of 1.0 % in the overall price increase).In addition, the largescale floods resulted in an unexpected increase in foodstuff prices (contribution of 2.6 % in the overall price increase). This year, inflation is expected to decline to 6.0%. The slow process of decreasing inflation is mainly determined by the harmonization of indirect taxes with the minimum levels in the EU, pursued early in the year. As the change in indirect taxes and administered prices has a direct effect on domestic inflation, their catching-up adjustment should be effected before the years during which they will be used as basis for evaluation of compliance with the Maastricht criteria – i.e. before 2008. From this perspective, earlier timing of harmonization of some excise taxes is a step to facilitate significantly the performance on the inflation criterion, as it would eliminate the proinflationary impact of an increase in these taxes in the years in which such evaluation will be made.  In conclusion, I would like to sum up that, in the light of the rapid change in the structure of our economy, the stable macroeconomic policy pursued by the Government and the BNB, and the prospects for EU membership, the concerns, expressed in the leaflet for this Conference, of possible overheating of the economy and the risks this entails for its stability, seem rather exaggerated. The country’s external imbalance financed by capital inflows is more of a signal of stability, credibility and potential for development of our economy. Of course, the economic policy makers are not and may not be complaisant. The challenges Bulgarian economy is facing are well recognized, and there is the will to take all the necessary measures to preserve the stability and growth in the economy. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention. BIS Review 22/2006 3 
Adrian Orr: Towards a framework for promoting financial stability in New Zealand Speech by Mr Adrian Orr, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, presented to the Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand, Wellington, 22 March 2006. This speech draws on an article by Hunter, Orr and White forthcoming in the Reserve Bank Bulletin March 2006. *      *      * Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this conference on New Zealand infrastructure. The topic I have been assigned is "What infrastructure do we need to develop in order to keep New Zealand growing?"  When people refer to infrastructure, they probably have in mind physical infrastructure, like transport, energy, water and communication networks. Those are all critical to growing the economy, and certainly in New Zealand they have been attracting a fair amount of attention. However, I will focus on an aspect of economic infrastructure that is at the core of the Reserve Bank's role, that is, New Zealand's financial infrastructure.  The financial system I will argue is at least as critical to the future growth of the New Zealand economy as the physical infrastructure, though probably is more taken for granted. In this speech I will outline the beginnings of a framework for assessing the promotion of financial stability, and outline why the Reserve Bank of New Zealand sees it as an important role. I will also highlight some of the areas the Bank is working on to promote financial stability. The critical role of the financial system The financial system is not infrastructure in perhaps the traditional sense of the word (e.g. wires, bricks and mortar, electricity, communication devices). The system is also made up of legal structures, agreed behaviours and practices, information and knowledge. Of course, if the power goes off or phones go down, the financial system will struggle to operate. We think of the system as comprised of three interconnected components: financial markets, institutions, and payments systems. Financial markets are where financial contracts are entered into or traded directly between buyers and sellers (or borrowers and lenders). Financial institutions intermediate between borrowers and lenders (including the central bank) and provide financial services. While payments systems allow financial transactions within markets and with institutions to be made.  These components of the financial system act together to enable the vast majority of economic exchange, and play a pivotal role in the allocation of economic and financial resources. In markets this is done through the `price mechanism': buyers who most highly value a particular resource will bid a higher price, and under certain conditions markets can set prices so as to efficiently allocate resources to where they have the most value (at least as measured by ability to pay). In practice, financial institutions allocate resource depending on the level of risk that the institution wishes to be exposed to.  Achieving efficiency in allocating resources is mostly about ensuring that the conditions required for optimal economic exchange are satisfied. These conditions include the existence of markets that can allocate all forms of financial risk, clear ownership rights of both financial risk and reward, and investors having adequate information with which to make their financial decisions. The efficiency of BIS Review 22/2006 1 
the financial system itself is mostly about satisfying the conditions required for competition, for example, low barriers to entry and an absence of monopoly powers.  It is important to note that at the same time as the system prices and allocates resource, it is pricing and allocating risk. The price of risk is the additional yield (or premium) an investor would expect to receive for holding a risky asset over and above the `risk-free' interest rate. Hence, in a market, investors who can best manage the risk associated with an asset will be prepared to receive a lower risk premium in compensation for the risk exposure (or conversely pay a higher asset price). Efficient pricing of risk therefore will tend to result in risk being allocated to those who best understand the nature of the risk, and are most willing and well-positioned to manage it. In this sense, an efficient financial system is also a stable one.  When is a financial system stable?  It may come as a surprise to many of you in the audience, but the last few decades have been recognised internationally as amongst the most financially unstable in modern history.1 Many regions during this period have experienced periods of financial instability. This includes New Zealand, Australia, and Scandinavia, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan throughout much of the 1990s, East Asia in 1997/98, and the United States, first in the early 1990s (the Savings and Loan crisis) and again early this decade (the ‘tech wreck’). These experiences have resulted in financial stability issues coming to the fore of central banks' attention.  Many central banks, including the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, now publish regular financial stability reports alongside their regular monetary policy and inflation reports. However, the framework for undertaking this surveillance and for linking financial system surveillance to its policy powers and purposes is less developed than for central banks' monetary policy function. Unlike inflation targeting, financial stability is not an easily quantified concept, and is also not clearly separable from other factors such as political stability, international financial stability, and wider economic and social stability. In general terms, a financial system is stable when it has the resilience to continue to efficiently provide financial services under a plausible range of adverse circumstances. A plausible range of financial losses should also be able to be absorbed without financial system disruption. By contrast, the financial system can be considered impaired when a material number of users incur significant losses from exposures to financial system risks that they could not have been expected to be aware of, or manage.2 We thus define the preconditions for financial stability as existing when all financial system risks are adequately identified, allocated, priced and managed.  All four of these preconditions may not be strictly necessary or relevant in every instance. In some cases the preconditions could be adequately met through non-price approaches to risk management. Or one might argue that in a perfect market with full information, adequately ‘priced’ risk would also imply adequately identified, allocated and managed risk (in which case adequate pricing alone would be the only relevant precondition). For generality, and because the market fails for various reasons, we see an adequate combination of identification, pricing, allocation and management of financial system risk as necessary for financial stability. This definition of financial stability is in terms of preconditions rather than outcomes, and hence it is not like the definition of price stability in the Reserve Bank's Policy Targets Agreement. Our definition of financial stability is also an ex ante (rather than ex post) definition. Its value thus lies in prompting questions for policymakers and financial system users in relation to whether an apparent imbalance or misalignment may be a source of financial instability.  However, even if the preconditions for financial stability are in place, volatility and sharp adjustments in financial prices (and/or quantities) can still occur. These are often an important part of the adjustment                                                       1  See Aliber (2005) "The 35 most tumultuous years in monetary history: shocks, the transfer problem, and financial trauma" IMF Staff Papers, Vol 52. Special Issue 2  From Draghi, Giavazzi, and Merton (2006): "To understand the breeding conditions for financial crises the prime source of concern is not risk per se, but the unintended, or unanticipated accumulation of risks..." 2 BIS Review 22/2006 
process in a sound and stable system. Short-term price volatility is often caused by the ‘price discovery’ or ‘quantity adjustment’ process that occurs as economic circumstances change. Such volatility is, however, less likely to lead to financial instability or necessitate some form of crisis intervention if the preconditions for financial stability are in place. Furthermore, financial crises can and will still occur. Financial crises are caused by a combination of unlikely events where the correlations were not obvious ex ante. Hence financial crisis management capabilities are necessary. Financial system risks, instability and market failures Financial system risks exist in all components of the financial system. If any one component (markets, institutions, and payments systems) of the financial system is impaired, then it can become unstable and will not operate to allocate resources efficiently. The main types of financial system risk can be categorised as credit, market, liquidity, and operational risks.  Credit risk relates to the risk that contracts represented as payable as a fixed sum of money in the future will not be paid in full on maturity.  Market risk relates to the potential for the market value of an asset to fluctuate because of, for example, changed credit risk assessment, changed assessments of the future income flow from the asset, or a change in the rate of exchange between currencies.  Liquidity risk is the risk that a loss might be incurred as the result of a forced sale. Operational risk relates to the risk of economic loss caused by a process breakdown, for example, computer failure, human error, or fraud.  Financial instability can be triggered by a variety of causes and shocks. These causes generally arise from combinations of structural and behavioural factors. Structural market failures are attributable to factors such as information asymmetries, externalities, and moral hazard. Behavioural market failures refer to issues such as herd behaviour in investment decisions, and investment fads and fashions, or myopia in decision making around various components of the financial system.  There is substantial overlap between these structural/behavioural categories; for example a structural problem such as information asymmetry will likely contribute to herd behaviour, by causing agents to rely more on observations of each other's trades for information regarding the appropriate market price. Structural failures An important determinant of structural failures in the financial system is information asymmetry. Sellers (or borrowers) typically know more about the risks embodied in the exchange than do buyers (lenders). Faced with such an asymmetry, buyers will be cautious, and will tend to over-estimate (price) risk. If risk is over-priced, this may drive out the less-risky activities, causing buyers (lenders) to become more cautious still. Such a process can result in less exchange than would otherwise be the case if the two sides to the exchange were more equally informed.  Hence, an important purpose of financial regulation is to address this information gap. The regulation may include insisting on a greater level of disclosure, or imposing certain standards on sellers (borrowers). Financial regulation, like many other forms of regulation, thus generally entails a combination of disclosure requirements and standard setting.  The existence of externalities and ‘free-rider’ opportunities in some instances also means that risks may not be borne by the owner of the asset, and hence not priced or managed adequately. A result can be that under-investment in some risk management tasks may occur, such as, for example, ensuring the ongoing operational capacity of critical payment systems in a systemically important financial institution.  Structural factors can mean that identifying, pricing, allocating, and managing financial risks can be very difficult at times, if not impossible, thus necessitating various forms of prudential regulation, financial crisis management capabilities, and/or the public provision of certain financial services. For example, it is difficult to be able to identify all threats to financial stability ex ante. Hence, some forms of risk are best managed by ensuring adequate capital buffers are in place to absorb losses without BIS Review 22/2006 3 
disruption to the system. The Basel II process of allocating capital buffers to various forms of financial risks in banks is an example of such an intervention.  Some forms of risk are also not adequately priced due to the lack of a market for the price discovery process to occur. Likewise, both free-rider and externality aspects of certain payment system networks may mean that risks are not allocated accordingly and may be mismanaged. This may necessitate the public provision of certain services (e.g. utility networks) or prepositioned loss allocation mechanisms in the case of a bank failure.  Behavioural stresses The financial system can also be exposed to destabilising behaviours. These influences can be exacerbated by some of the structural weaknesses discussed already, especially for example, the phenomenon of contagious bank runs.  Recent developments in the field of behavioural finance have extended our understanding of the potential sources of financial instability. Concepts such as myopic decision-making, cognitive dissonance (repression of contradictory evidence), and fallacy of composition, some of which come from psychology, are receiving wider recognition in relation to the study of financial stability.  It is becoming increasingly recognised that individually "rational" people all making the same choices can lead to herd behaviour and momentum that can drive a market price far away from that consistent with underlying returns and risks. For example, Kindleberger (1996)3 describes how `euphoria' can turn into mania, as speculation "leads from normal rational behaviour to what has been described as `mania' or a `bubble'." History gives us many examples of ‘mania', bank runs, asset bubbles and other financial crises, from as early as the Dutch tulip bulb bubble in 1636 to the present day. Aliber (2005) describes the effect of financial deregulation in enabling Japanese banks to rapidly increase their real estate loans - resulting in both property price increases, and real estate company increases, boosting the Tokyo stock exchange. At the same time, Aliber notes that when Nordic controls on foreign borrowing were lifted, there was an inflow of foreign (notably Japanese) funds which led to real estate and stock price bubbles in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The Mexican crisis of the 1990's had its roots in over-optimism regarding the success of macroeconomic reform. Excessive lending driven by high expectations of growth helped to create both the Asian crisis and the US stock market bubble in the latter years of the 1990s and early this decade.  New Zealand had a similar experience in the second half of the 1980s, when economic reform and financial liberalisation resulted in a surge in credit expansion and correspondingly leveraged bubbles in commercial real estate and listed equity prices. When it became apparent that the market's assessment of risk had become substantially misaligned from the returns, a reassessment triggered by the sharemarket correction in the US in October 1987, caused the bubble to burst and widespread defaults occurred. This correction of previous misalignments caused material damage to the financial system, including the failure and hence closure of a number of financial institutions and a significant fall in equity market participation for several years following.  A common element in most of these mentioned financial crises has been the rapid expansion in the supply of bank credit which, at least with the benefit of hindsight, was priced too cheaply (i.e., the risks were under-priced). Borio (2005)4 emphasises credit supply by highlighting the role of `financial imbalances' in causing crises. That is, where lenders over-extend themselves by financing highly leveraged assets that turn out to be incapable of generating the cash flows required to service the debt.  However, credit growth measures and asset market valuations alone are not necessarily good financial stability indicators. Rather, it is assessing "why" the indicators have moved that matters most, and hence the need for a framework to assess these developments.                                                       3  Kindleberger (1996) "Manias, Panics and Crashes: A history of financial crises" John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

Financial system assessment and regulatory balance Making assessments of financial stability risks, such as the sustainability of credit expansions and large asset price movements, is difficult. The extent to which central banks should attempt such assessments is also an area of considerable debate. Much of the debate concerns rather polar positions, that is, whether or not central banks should ‘target’ asset prices. The financial stability assessment framework outlined in this speech does not approach this question as an "either-or" issue, but instead aims to assist an assessment-based approach by providing a framework of questions.  Furthermore, crafting the regulatory infrastructure to support the process of economic exchange is far from straightforward. For example, regulation that excessively constrains sellers, whether directly or through imposition of compliance costs, can cause them to withdraw from the market and lead to economic inefficiencies. Significant ‘moral hazard’ problems can also arise, where over-regulation can remove the actual financial risk from the owner of the asset, institution, market, or payment system. The public provision of certain financial services may also crowd out competition and innovation.  It is also very important to recognise that markets can and do generate their own solutions to what otherwise would be information asymmetry market failures. Financial intermediaries themselves are a market response to this underlying economic problem. The role of a bank is to monitor and manage the risks embedded in risky loans that depositors would be unable to monitor themselves. Banks in effect facilitate the economic exchange between depositors and borrowers by playing a role that balances up the information asymmetry.  However, there is always the question: who monitors the monitors? In the financial system, a number of mechanisms perform this role: shareholders, and those appointed by them (boards of directors and auditors), creditors, rating agencies, and regulators.  Experience suggests that market-based solutions - sometimes with regulatory prompting and encouragement - can often result in a better performing financial system than over-relying on regulatory interventions. The Reserve Bank thus balances self and market discipline practices and requirements, with additional regulatory requirements. We are acutely aware of the importance of getting this balance right, and the risks of over-regulation. The general principles we aspire to in all that we do with our prudential regulation role thus include: • Keeping efficiency issues at the centre of our attention; • Utilising the synergies amongst our monetary policy, macro prudential, supervision and market operation roles; • Maintaining a system overview as well as knowing individual institutions well; • Seeking to utilise market forces as far as possible rather than oppose them; • Recognising that we have many common interests with supervised institutions; • Using incentive-based techniques as much as possible; and  • Making sure that we maintain high analytical standards in our regulatory design. In summary, we approach financial system regulation from the stand point of its role in enabling economic activity - by supporting the processes by which people and firms can engage in welfare improving specialisation and trade. To regulate to enable might seem something of a contradiction. However, for any system to work there needs to be some rules, referees, and general confidence. Users of the system need to have a basis for being confident about their financial contracts, institutions, markets, and payments networks. Absent a basis for confidence, the scope for welfare enhancing economic and financial exchange is diminished. The Reserve Bank's activities in promoting financial stability The Reserve Bank promotes the stability of New Zealand's monetary and financial system - comprising the monetary unit of account, and the markets, institutions, and systems that make monetary exchange possible - through various activities. These activities include: maintaining low and stable inflation (i.e., maintaining the purchasing power of our money liabilities); acting as banker to the banks (and the government); prudentially supervising registered banks and being prepared to manage BIS Review 22/2006 5 
a bank failure; overseeing the payments and settlement system; and maintaining a reserve of foreign currency for financial crisis management.  The Bank's activities in promoting financial stability generally fall into the prevention, correction, and crisis management categories. These are outlined in Tables 1 and 2 below. Table 1.

For example, in the prudential supervision of banks an important element is the registration process. This process is directed to ensuring that banks are established with appropriate governance arrangements and capability, as well as having adequate capital for the business to be undertaken soundly and so that plausible losses are able to be absorbed without disruption. The disclosures that registered banks in New Zealand make also have an important preventative role, by bringing to bear the scrutiny of the market place on how banks are identifying, allocating, pricing and managing their financial risks.  The Reserve Bank also plays a direct role in the surveillance of the financial system, through its direct supervisory and banking relationships, participation in the financial markets (particularly in foreign exchange and government securities), and wider financial system and macroeconomic surveillance and analysis. Much of this work is reported on in the Bank's Financial Stability Report and Monetary Policy Statement. The Bank thus contributes generally to the provision of information and analysis to the market place.  At the macroeconomic level, imbalances such as inflation pressures and large surpluses or deficits on the current account of the balance of payments, can make the financial system more susceptible to shocks that test the resilience of the financial system. To assess how risky these imbalances are requires a good understanding of the causes of the imbalance, and of the underlying financial drivers. Again, understanding the "why" matters more than knowing the "what". This assessment combines judgement, research, forecasting and economic models.  However, no system of policies and procedures can ensure that the conditions for financial stability are met all of the time. From time to time there will be developments where the Bank will become less BIS Review 22/2006 7 
confident that risks are being adequately identified, priced, allocated, or managed, and where interventions to lessen the potential for emerging financial instability will be called for.  Correction and crisis management The Reserve Bank's interventions aimed at correcting potential preconditions for financial instability may take a number of different forms, depending on the analysis (including taking account of any unintended consequences of our intervention). Such Bank interventions may range from Governors' speeches that draw attention to the issue, through to the Bank exercising powers (with the consent of the Minister of Finance) by which it can give directions to a registered bank or banks.  The Bank may also use its own capital or balance sheet to intervene in financial markets, such as for example, intervening in the foreign exchange market or providing the markets access to the Bank's bond portfolio in order to bolster liquidity.  There is also overlap between the Bank's monetary policy and financial stability roles. For example, asset price bubbles have the potential to overwhelm monetary policy responses and threaten financial stability. The Reserve Bank Governor recently acknowledged that in rare situations an (asset class) price misalignment may be sufficiently obvious that a monetary policy response in excess of that required for the usual price stability objective could be required; in these cases in particular, a longer term view of the risks to price stability would be appropriate.5 The Bank also has a crisis management role. Some categories of extreme and very low probability risk are also inherently difficult for the financial system to price and manage - the so-called "uninsurable" risks. Most insurance policies, for example, excluded compensation for loss arising from the Y2K problem (a once in a millennium event!). Another example of the Reserve Bank's contingency planning for a low probability, but potentially very damaging event, is its preparation for a potential influenza pandemic.6  While `lender of last resort', foreign exchange intervention, and bank statutory management are the crisis management activities that are usually associated with a central bank, a recent additional example is the Reserve Bank's outsourcing policy.7 A primary motivation for that policy is to better ensure that should a (large) bank become insolvent, or should an important provider of outsourced services no longer be able to deliver, that bank could continue to be operated. Again, while such an event may be in the low probability category, it would have significant consequences for the financial system as a whole. In order to implement any policy action, the Bank must be satisfied that the action is necessary and beneficial.

   No      Implement policy action  Recent policy developments Over the past few years we have “re-invigorated” the Bank's own financial stability role. This has been reflected in a number of ways. In November 2004, we commenced publishing a twice-yearly Financial Stability Report, as a complement to our quarterly Monetary Policy Statements. We have also introduced a local incorporation and an out-sourcing policy for registered banks. The former requires large banks to be incorporated in New Zealand, rather than operate as a branch of a foreign bank (as has been the case with Westpac). The latter requires banks to manage out-sourcing of core banking functions in a way that does not compromise their ability to maintain a core operational capability should a service provider become unable or unwilling to provide those functions.  The local incorporation and outsourcing policies have been introduced mainly to improve the resilience of the New Zealand banking system in a bank failure situation. That is a situation that we all hope falls into the "rare event" category, though we know from experience that bank failures can and do happen. And we know that there is a tendency for rare events to slip into the background, and in the case of those that could be very damaging, perhaps more than they should. One of the jobs of the Reserve Bank is to act as a counter to such tendencies.  In parallel with progressing these issues, which affect mainly the large Australian-owned banks, steps have been taken to strengthen the harmonisation and co-ordination of trans-Tasman banking supervision. Last year, the Trans-Tasman Council on Banking Supervision was established, with a terms of reference which cover supervisory co-operation, preparedness for responding to crises that involve banks that are common to both countries, and whether legislative changes may be required to ensure APRA and the RBNZ support each other in their regulatory responsibilities, at least regulatory cost. The Council recommended some legislative changes, for enactment in both Australia and New 10 BIS Review 22/2006 
Zealand. Dr Cullen and the Australian Treasurer announced following their annual meeting that both Governments will be promoting those legislative amendments.  Currently we are also involved in the Government contingency planning for a possible influenza pandemic. Besides making contingency plans to maintain our own operations, we have been working with the banks to ensure that business continuity planning is in place, and that key payments systems and cash distribution arrangements could be adequately maintained in the unlikely event that an influenza pandemic would impact on staff availability. We have been consulting with banks on how they envisage handling disruptions in household and business ability to service debt during a pandemic period, and to ensure that they are adequately positioned to cope with potential disruptions to the wholesale international funding markets our banks rely on. We are also liaising with other infrastructure providers, in particular, telecommunications services. Banks will need to isolate staff, and would expect an upsurge in the use of internet services; and the ability to operate ‘remotely’ will be a key requirement for our own preparedness. Steps are also being taken to ensure continuation of core services such as the operation of monetary policy, and the provision of currency and liquidity. Even if no pandemic hits us in the next few years, such planning will stand us in good stead for the future. The payments system is a component of financial system infrastructure that has been reconfigured substantially during the past decade or so to strengthen its financial resilience. Without going into technical details, we are now in a position where the great bulk of "high value" payments - mostly those connected with wholesale financial market and inter-bank foreign exchange dealing, and which amount to more than $35 billion on an average day - are fully certain (in Reserve Bank funds) for the recipient at the point they are made. This has been achieved by the introduction of "real-time gross settlement" arrangements. In the case of most foreign exchange transactions, these arrangements have been taken a step further, with the payments across the accounts of the two separate central banks whose currencies are involved also now being synchronized. This has removed the time difference between, for example paying NZD's in New Zealand and receiving USD in New York, and the risk of loss arising from a default occurring during that time gap.  And we are not overlooking the retail payments system. Work is in progress with the New Zealand banking industry on two major issues. First, to improve the legal and financial clarity and resilience of the arrangements for processing the several million retail payments made every day in New Zealand. Second, to review the access and governance arrangements in the retail payment system to ensure the system remains durable in the face of changes in the technical and commercial landscape.  A key part of our regulatory strategy for promoting the resilience of the financial system is our capital adequacy framework for banks. Banks need to hold sufficient capital in order to be able financially to withstand major loss and be positioned for future growth, so that the financial system can continue to circulate liquidity and provide funding for economic activity in New Zealand in the face of stress.  It is important to be clear here that we are not talking about banks dealing with the "expected" losses that occur as a normal part of banking business - that is the role of provisioning. Rather, the focus of capital adequacy is on unexpected loss, or the rare but potentially debilitating losses associated with, for example, severe downturns in the economy's performance or gyrations in the prices of key collateral assets such as housing. Under such abnormal circumstances, the diversification strategies rightfully adopted by banks to manage risk in normal times may fail, as borrowers' risks more closely correlate, leaving capital as the only remaining defence.  A major priority for our policy work this year is to implement the updated international benchmark for bank capital adequacy, known as Basel II, with these objectives in mind. Two of the driving principles behind Basel II are to improve regulatory capital requirements to make them more sensitive to the risks of unexpected loss, and to sharpen the focus of engagements between supervisors and banks on ensuring that banks have adequately accounted for the risks of unexpected loss in their capital management.  Finally, we are currently engaged in important work in progress on the regulation of the non-bank financial sector - covering finance companies, building societies, credit unions, insurance companies and managed funds. This work has progressed to the point that the Government has decided that non-bank deposit takers, insurers and superannuation funds should be subject to a higher level of prudential supervision than currently and that, in principle, the Reserve Bank should be that supervisor. The next step will be a discussion paper that puts some more details on these proposals, BIS Review 22/2006 11 
presently envisaged for release in mid-2006. These developments signify the important role seen for these categories of financial institution in New Zealand's financial infrastructure.  Conclusion This speech presents a step towards a broad conceptual framework for promoting financial system stability and guiding the Bank's policy actions. We argue that the preconditions for financial stability exist when all financial system risks are being adequately identified, allocated, priced and managed. The financial system is made up of markets, institutions, and payments and settlement systems. Financial system risks broadly include credit, liquidity, market and operational risks.  All of the preconditions are important to best ensuring that the financial system is resilient to a wide range of economic and financial shocks, and able to absorb financial crisis losses with least disruption. The preconditions for financial stability also best ensure that the financial system is efficient in its delivery of financial services, as well as allocating resources efficiently. In making assessments of financial stability, the Reserve Bank does not have a single, well-defined quantitative measure. Instead we draw on a variety of information, practices, and on-going research. The Bank conducts regular surveillance of financial risks and reports on its assessments in the twice-yearly Financial Stability Report.  12 BIS Review 22/2006 
Axel A Weber: The role of money in the monetary policy of the Eurosystem Remarks by Mr Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at the panel discussion: ECB monetary policy: the first seven years, at an ECB colloquium held in honour of Otmar Issing: Monetary policy: a journey from theory to practice, Frankfurt, 16 March 2006. *      *      * It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this colloquium to honour the work of Otmar Issing. My brief remarks will focus on the role of money in the monetary policy framework of the Eurosystem.  The appropriate role of money in monetary policy is a question to which Otmar has made an invaluable contribution not only during his tenure at the ECB but throughout his whole professional career:  • as an academic since 1960  • as a member of the German Council of Economic Experts 1988-1990  • as a member of the board of Deutsche Bundesbank and its chief economist 1990-1998  • and as board member and chief economist of the ECB since 1998  As President of the Deutsche Bundesbank I would like to take this unique opportunity to pay my tribute to Otmar- both in a personal capacity and on behalf of the institution.  The role of money in the design of monetary policy in the euro area has been one of the more criticised aspects in our monetary policy strategy.  From a theoretical point of view, the New–Keynesian approach, which forms the current paradigm in monetary economics, by and large doubts the relevance of money to monetary policy making in an environment in which central banks predominantly use a short-term interest rate to achieve their goals.  In addition, though from a theoretical less radical point of view, market participants often criticise that the contribution of the monetary analysis to the decision-making process of the Governing Council is not as obvious as it should be.  I will argue in my following remarks that both criticisms are unjustified in view of the challenging task of conducting monetary policy in real time in an uncertain environment.  First of all, there is a general consensus that “inflation is a monetary phenomenon” – as Milton Friedman put it; a central bank that aims at price stability therefore simply cannot afford to completely discard monetary indicators; and what I learn from more recent deliberations of central banks that traditionally have a more critical attitude towards the use of monetary indicators – such as e.g. the Bank of England – confirms my assessment.  However, how exactly monetary analysis is implemented and how it is used for monetary policy decisions depends crucially on the empirical relationship between monetary aggregates, inflation and other macroeconomic variables of interest.  The question can be put in simple terms: How monetarist should one be? And my simple and agnostic answer is: as monetarist as the empirical evidence supports.  There is a well-established long-run relationship between money growth and inflation in the euro area: monetary aggregates in the euro area prove to have explanatory power for longer-term inflationary developments. This is documented, not least, by current research carried out in the Bundesbank.  As long as these relationships hold, there are convincing empirical reasons for paying close attention to monetary developments in the policy making process.  Beyond this issue, there are further conceptual reasons why money should matter: It offers a suitable longer term perspective for internal decision-making and external communication, and thus enhances credibility. Of course, this latter point is of general importance for central banks but it has been especially important for the Eurosystem and its monetary policy at the beginning of the third stage of EMU. In 1999 the Eurosystem did not possess its own established track record. Thus, a strategy making use of the empirically established long-term relationship between money growth and inflation was especially important to gain and secure credibility right from the outset of EMU.  BIS Review 21/2006 1 
And all this is irrespective of questions as to whether there is an active role for money to play in the transmission mechanism, i.e. whether money is exogenous or endogenous.  This brings me back to the more academic criticism that stems from the New-Keynesian school of thought. Despite all the undoubted merits of such an approach – sound theoretical principles, microfoundations, general equilibrium character – it also has its shortcomings.  Firstly, the transmission mechanism is specified too leanly and mechanistically.  For example, one prominent channel for the role of money in this class of models is a real-balance effect – something that is empirically difficult to verify and arguably too simplistic in the present-day world of financial markets. Some years ago, in the controversy between monetarists and Keynesians Allan Meltzer argued that: “The difference between the Keynesians and us is less in the nature of the process than in the range of assets considered“. Applied to the current environment, those words have not lost much relevance.  Furthermore, the New-Keynesian approach is a natural extension of the real business cycle framework to a world with nominal rigidities. As such, it focuses on short-term deviations of the relevant variables from trend. The empirical evidence for the correlation between money and inflation, however, is of a low-frequency nature. In other words, it is more relevant to the trend behaviour of inflation.  In a nutshell, given the empirical evidence, it seems that the New-Keynesian framework is missing something important in the working-mechanisms of the economy and the inflation generating processes that govern it. Something that is– at least - empirically captured by the information content of monetary aggregates.  Moreover, the merits of analysing monetary developments in a broad framework encompassing credit dynamics allows to extract valuable information with regard to possible financial market tensions caused by the build-up of asset price bubbles.  In the light of these considerations it is not so much a question of whether monetary policy in the Eurosystem should pay close attention to monetary aggregates. The more relevant issue is how this should best be done, that is, how monetary aggregates should feature in the monetary policy design.  Here, the challenging task for monetary analysis is how to separate in real time the noise in the short-run development of monetary aggregates from the part of monetary dynamics that signals risks to future price stability.  Monetary analysis, properly understood and implemented, can not be a mechanical forecasting exercise. It has to take into account the possibilities of money demand shocks injecting noise into the liquidity-inflation nexus or possible structural shifts in money demand relations.  Up-to-date monetary analysis should be a broadly-based approach and an ongoing intellectual endeavour. And this is precisely how monetary analysis has developed over the past few years in the Eurosystem. In an environment of high financial uncertainty it has identified large liquidity shocks which led to significant portfolio shifts in liquid and secure bank deposits. And it has derived a toolbox of liquidity measures signalling possible excess liquidity.  Applying this toolbox has allowed to separate liquidity developments rooted predominantly in financial uncertainties from developments signalling more imminent inflation risks. For example the actual strong increase in the money stock M3 which is accompanied by very low level of interest rates and a strong rise in loans to the private sector.  All in all, an elaborate analysis of monetary aggregates as well as their components and counterparts is a useful tool for monetary policymakers. It has clearly the potential to enhance the robustness of our judgments about future economic developments. In the past few years, academic research has emphasised the advantages of robust analytical tools for appropriate policy responses in an environment of prevailing uncertainty – something that has always been known by practitioners of central banking.  However, besides this longer-term nature of the relationship between monetary developments and inflation, there is the need to take into account also other and more short-term risks to price stability. This is the core of the economic analysis in the strategy of the Eurosystem.  Given the different time horizons of the economic and monetary analysis I think that the demands that are sometimes brought-up in the public debate to merge the two pillars are not convincing. There is no existing model that would allow to integrate the multitude of economic information that is relevant for 2 BIS Review 21/2006 
monetary policy in one coherent theoretical structure. This is especially relevant for the integration of monetary aggregates into traditional macroeconomic and macroeconometric models. Insofar, proposals to merge the two pillars are ill-founded. The ultimate goal of the two-pillar structure is the efficient utilisation of available information for monetary policy decisions and communication. However, one possible approach with regard to the information gained through the lens of the economic and monetary analysis might be found in a stronger formalised combined assessment of the information included in both pillars for future inflation developments. This is in a sense what the cross-checking is all about. Of course, the merits of a more formalised forecasting combination would have to be weighted against any possible loss of information that might be associated with it.  This brings me to another criticism that is sometimes voiced, namely that monetary developments are not regarded as being informative about the Eurosystem’s monetary policy decisions. In my view, this criticism is unjustified:  Firstly, the very nature of the information content of the monetary analysis has to take into account its role as a cross-checking device and its focus on longer-term risks to price stability. Secondly, in an environment of heightened financial market uncertainty actual monetary dynamics may to a large part be driven by noise which does not necessitate a monetary policy reaction. The portfolio-shift adjustment of money growth in the post 2001 period can be seen as an example.  By the way: The role of money in our policy decisions has been analysed in recent empirical research; on that issue which found a kind of non-linear relationship between monetary developments and policy reaction. Such threshold effects in my view deserve further empirical investigation.  Let me conclude by saying that the experience of the first seven years of EMU has shown:  •  that the monetary analysis plays an important role in our policy strategy and our policy decisions  • that the monetary analysis is a challenging and evolving exercise given today’s financial market dynamics  • but that, even in such an environment, money has an empirically justified informative role.

Lars Nyberg: The framework of modern central banking Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Conference on Reforming the State Bank of Vietnam, Hanoi, 21 March 2006.  *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to this conference on reforming the State Bank of Vietnam. I imagine that one reason why I have been invited here is that the central bank I represent, Sveriges Riksbank in Sweden, just over a decade ago was in a situation which resembles the one the State Bank of Vietnam is experiencing now. At that time we had reached a situation where there were strong reasons – if not imperative ones – for reconsidering the way in which we used to think about monetary policy. It became clear that a reform of monetary policy and its framework was both desirable and necessary. Of course, Sweden is by no means the only country where monetary policy has undergone major changes in recent times. The view of how best to conduct monetary policy has changed fairly radically over the past twenty years and this has been reflected in a more or less worldwide reform process.  What I hope to be able to contribute here today – as an introduction to the discussions – is to provide an overall picture of the ideas that formed the basis for this process and to describe what are today considered to be the guiding principles for a modern central bank, according to established research and practical experiences. What objectives should a central bank have? The most fundamental question to ask when one is on the point of reforming the monetary policy framework is, of course, what the objective of monetary policy should be. On a very general level the objective of monetary policy can be said to be to create an environment where the economy can develop in the best possible manner. However, this definition is too general to be of any great practical use, although it excludes some tasks that are sometimes imposed on central banks. To obtain a more operational definition, it is necessary to take the discussion one step further and ask the question of how monetary policy can contribute to favourable economic development. On a fundamental plane, one could say that the central bank’s main task should be to ensure that the payment system in the economy functions efficiently. This means in simple terms that payments and financial transactions can be made easily and smoothly and entail as little risk as possible. Many scholars also regard this as the main reason why central banks were originally founded1.  An economy’s payment system can be regarded as a sort of infrastructure in roughly the same way as the country’s communications network or energy supply system. It also essentially fulfils the same purpose, i.e. to ensure that the flows essential to the economy – in this case the flow of money – functions properly. However, ensuring that the payment system functions efficiently is also a fairly general definition that requires further precision. To become more specific, it is necessary to define what characterises an efficient payment system. I intend to discuss two characteristics here that I perceive to be the most central – price stability and financial stability. Price stability An important component of an efficient payment system is that economic agents have confidence that the value of the means of payment will remain stable over time, that is in practice that inflation will be low and stable. One usually expresses this as there being a nominal anchor that prevents inflation and inflation expectations from drifting off. If households and companies are confident that the general price level will not change very much, they are better able to plan for the future and need not put effort                                                       1  See, for instance, Santomero, A.M., S. Viotti and A. Vredin, (2001), "Challenges for Central Banking: An Introduction”, in Santomero, A.M., S. Viotti and A. Vredin (ed.), Challenges for Central Banking, Kluwer Academic Publishers. BIS Review 21/2006 1 
into finding ways of protecting themselves against inflation, but can focus on more productive activities. Another argument for keeping inflation low focuses on the role of price formation as a signalling system. When inflation is low and stable it is easier for economic agents to distinguish changes in relative prices and to adjust their decisions regarding consumption, saving, work and investment accordingly. High and fluctuating inflation, on the other hand, disrupts the signalling function of the pricing system and can more easily lead to bad economic decisions. In an environment with low inflation, the price system can do a better job in allocating resources to uses where they will do most good. In a broader sense, one could see an efficient pricing system as part of an efficient payment system – it ensures that the transactions made are based on the best information possible. Price stability can also be justified for reasons not immediately connected with the efficiency of the payment system, such as the fact that high and fluctuating inflation tends to give rise to undesirable distribution effects. For instance, inflation appears to hit poor people hardest as the rich usually have better opportunities to protect themselves, or even to benefit, from the effects of inflation2. This could be because, for instance, poor people often have no other opportunity than to retain a large part of their limited assets in the form of money or because they are to a greater extent than the rich dependent on public subsidies that are not fully indexed. Keeping inflation low and stable is currently the most obvious – and definitely the most noticed – task for modern central banks. The reason for the focus on price stability is of course the negative experiences of the high and fluctuating inflation many countries experienced in the 1970s and 1980s. During this period one could say that the central banks’ original task of guaranteeing the value of the means of payment was neglected as other tasks, primarily affecting demand in the economy, were perceived as more important and more interesting for monetary policy. The consequence was that the nominal anchor was relinquished and to establish it again proved to require considerable effort. Let me before I discuss the other important component of an efficient payment system – financial stability – say something about the most common approaches to attaining price stability. There are currently two predominant means of trying to ensure that inflation remains at a low and stable level. One is to tie one’s own currency to the currency of a country with a long tradition of low and stable inflation. The fixed exchange rate thus becomes an intermediate target through which one hopes to attain the ultimate target – price stability. The other means is to allow the exchange rate to float and to give the central bank the task of acting more directly to attain low, stable inflation – what is known as inflation targeting. The changeover in monetary policy made by Sweden at the beginning of the 1990s meant that we switched from the first method, fixing the exchange rate, to the second, targeting inflation. The reason was quite simply that the fixed exchange rate had not functioned very well as a means of keeping down inflation and establishing a nominal anchor in the economy. For a couple of decades we had failed to keep price and wage increases in check. However, a fixed exchange rate relationship is not, of course, compatible with an inflation rate that systematically exceeds that in the country to which the exchange rate is tied – sooner or later the exchange rate relationship must collapse. The rapid increases in wages and prices also repeatedly came into collision with the fixed exchange rate and the result was that the Swedish currency was devaluated on several occasions from the mid-1970s onwards. The economy was thus characterised by "boom-bust-cycles” with alternate strong acceleration and sudden braking.  However, the fact that the fixed exchange rate did not work as a nominal anchor in Sweden does not mean that it could not function well in other countries; it has unquestionably done so in many cases. So let me therefore move on and mention some general advantages and disadvantages of the two methods3.                                                       2  See Easterly, W. and S. Fischer, (2001), “Inflation and the Poor”, Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking 33, 2 (part 1), 160-178. For a more detailed account of the advantages of low, stable inflation, see for instance King, M., (2002), ”The Inflation Target Ten Years On”, Speech at the London School of Economics, November 19. 3  A more detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of these and other monetary policy regimes can be found in, for instance, Mishkin, F.S., (1999), ”International Experiences with Different Monetary Policy Regimes”, Journal of Monetary Economics 43, 579-605. 2 BIS Review 21/2006 
Perhaps the foremost advantage of having a fixed exchange rate regime as a means of keeping inflation under control is that it makes the task of monetary policy simple and straightforward: it shall set the key rate in a way that enables the exchange rate relationship to be maintained. This task is also easy for the general public to understand. At the same time, it may be a disadvantage that monetary policy is tied to this single task. It cannot then be used to subdue domestic disruptions that have no equivalent in the country to which the currency is tied – the anchor country. At the same time, disruptions in the anchor country will immediately affect the targeting country as interest rate adjustments in the anchor country will lead to corresponding interest rate adjustments in the targeting country. If, for instance, the interest rate in the anchor country is raised because demand in that country is increasing, the interest rate in the targeting country must also be increased in order to maintain the exchange rate relationship, even if the country is in a recession. A fixed exchange rate regime thus means that it is not possible to conduct an independent monetary policy. The task of keeping the economy in balance and of steering inflation more directly cannot thus rest with the central bank. A fixed exchange rate relationship can also be exposed to speculative attacks if it is not entirely credible. This was the case with the Swedish krona and several other European currencies at the beginning of the 1990s. With regard to inflation targeting, I am of course somewhat biased and for obvious reasons find it easier to point to advantages than disadvantages. One advantage is that a central bank which conducts inflation targeting is not tied to maintaining a particular exchange rate relationship, but can be more directly aimed at focussing on what is happening in the domestic economy. Another, partly related advantage – which I believe has been very important in Sweden’s case – is that inflation targeting means that one specific authority is given a clear responsibility for maintaining price stability. During the 1970s and 1980s it was not entirely clear where the responsibility for this lay in Sweden. One could say that the responsibility in practice had been delegated to the social partners, but that the total economic policy tended at the same time to be so expansionary that it became difficult to maintain wage and price increases at reasonable levels. A further advantage of inflation targeting is that the task of monetary policy, in the same way as with a fixed exchange rate regime, is easy for the general public to understand. If I am to try to find a disadvantage with inflation targeting, it could be that it is more difficult from a purely operational point of view for a central bank to steer inflation towards a particular level than to maintain a particular exchange rate relationship. Inflation targeting is thus much more demanding than a fixed exchange rate regime with regard to the central bank’s analytical work and its ability to communicate its policy. Whether this is something that should be regarded as a disadvantage or not is of course a question of judgement. For the Riksbank, the transition to inflation targeting heralded the start of a fairly comprehensive increase in competence in the field of economics. The number of PhD economists at the Riksbank has risen sharply in recent years and our research in areas related to monetary policy has expanded considerably.  Financial stability Let me now move on to the other central component of an efficient payment system. This concerns the stability in the financial system; particularly in the financial institutions that supply payment services, i.e. primarily the banks. Financial stability is currently regarded, parallel to the price stability target, as the main task of a modern central bank. The financial system has essentially three main tasks: converting savings into financing, managing risk and providing efficient channels of payment. Let me give a basic example. A bank receives savings from households which it then lends to other households or to companies that need to invest. Banks are specialists at valuing, monitoring and managing credit risks in the households and companies to which they lend. The bank therefore contributes to ensuring that the mediation of capital in the economy functions efficiently; it is sufficient that borrowers can convince the bank of their creditworthiness, they do not need to convince each individual saver. Similarly, savers do not have to assess the creditworthiness of every borrower; it is enough to be satisfied of the bank's solvency. The banks can also supply payment services for households and companies by using the existing financial infrastructure, such as accounts and various routines for transferring funds between financial institutions. As these functions are central to an efficient economy, it is evident that major problems can arise if financial stability is upset. This is aptly illustrated by, for instance, the crises in South East Asia at the BIS Review 21/2006 3 
end of the 1990s and by the bank crisis that Sweden and other countries suffered at the beginning of that same decade. While the target of maintaining price stability is relatively straightforward and intuitive, it is more difficult to specify the task of promoting financial stability. This task has also been formulated in slightly different ways in different central banks’ regulations. For instance, the Bank of England’s charter says that it is ”responsible for the overall stability of the financial system as a whole”, while the corresponding task in the regulations for Sweden’s Riksbank has been expressed in a more indirect manner: ”to promote the efficiency and safety of the payment system”4. One strategy for maintaining financial stability can briefly be described as consisting of three different parts: a clear regulatory framework, an efficient day-to-day prudential supervision and oversight and a preparedness to act strongly and quickly in a crisis. Exactly what role is played by the central bank in this strategy is also something that varies from country to country. Many central banks contribute in different ways to the formulation of the regulatory framework for the financial system, for instance, by giving their views on proposed bills and by participating in committees where domestic and international legislation is formulated. With regard to the day-to-day prudential supervision and oversight, one solution that is applied in Sweden and other countries is that the supervision of the financial sector is delegated to a special, independent authority with the power to apply sanctions. In other countries the supervision work is done by the central bank itself. In the cases where supervision is delegated to an independent authority, the central bank usually has an oversight role that entails regularly monitoring and analysing developments in the financial sector and presenting its views of the risks in the financial system. Ever since the bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, this has been perceived as a very important task in Sweden; in fact, it could be argued that the bank crisis was allowed to arise partly because no authority previously had the specific task of monitoring the overall financial stability. The Riksbank now publishes a twice-yearly report analysing the stability of the Swedish financial system. In a crisis situation, the central bank plays a very important role. It may then need to go in and act as lender of last resort, that is, to grant emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) to banks and financial companies if this is considered necessary to prevent the financial system from collapsing. The two objectives of price stability and financial stability are related to each other in different ways, in addition to both being important components of an efficient payment system. The stability of the financial system is of course a necessary condition for a policy aimed at price stability, as the latter is fairly meaningless if the country is threatened with economic collapse. The financial stability objective can therefore in one sense be said to be superior to the objective of price stability.  At the same time, it is very probable that price stability in the long run promotes financial stability, for instance, by making the price system function better and thereby reducing the risk of bad investments. However, price stability is no guarantee of stability in the financial system, which is illustrated, for instance, by the problems in the Japanese banks at the beginning of the 1990s. There is thus no reason for central banks to focus solely on the price stability objective and thereby assume that financial stability will follow automatically – both objectives are important.  Other objectives than price stability and financial stability? Are there any other objectives than price stability and financial stability that may be suitable for a modern central bank? Many countries also have objectives for developments in the real economy written into the regulatory framework governing the central bank’s activities. For instance, in the US legislation it says that the Federal Reserve shall promote “maximum employment”, while the British legislation says that the Bank of England shall support “the economic policy of Her Majesty’s Government, including its objectives for growth and employment”. In Sweden there is no specific objective for real economic developments written into the law, but it is nevertheless considered to be understood that the                                                       4  See, for instance, Oosterloo, S. and J. de Haan, (2003), ”A Survey of Institutional Frameworks for Financial Stability”, Occasional Studies Vol.I/No. 4, De Nederlandsche Bank, for an overview of how the task of promoting financial stability is dealt with in different central banks’ regulations and in practice. 4 BIS Review 21/2006 
Riksbank – as an authority under the Riksdag, the Swedish parliament – shall support the objectives of economic policy with the aim of attaining sustainable growth and a high level of employment. Exactly how the objectives are worded thus varies considerably between countries, often depending on the fact that changes and modifications have gradually been made to regulations originally written much earlier. I dare to claim nevertheless that the essence of modern central banks’ wording of their objectives is the same. It is a question of monetary policy, as I said earlier, being first and foremost aimed at ensuring there is a credible nominal anchor in the economy. As long as this nominal anchor does not risk coming loose, monetary policy can be aimed at stabilising the real economy. I shall return to this shortly and for now merely emphasise that the key word here is stabilise the real economy and nothing else. It may be interesting to note in this context that the experiences from the period of low, stable inflation have meant that price stability is now increasingly perceived as both an objective in itself and as a means of achieving other macroeconomic objectives5. There are many indications that price stability has beneficial effects on efficiency and growth in the economy. The reasons can be those I just mentioned, i.e. that the price system functions better as a signalling mechanism in a low inflation environment and that households and companies can spend more time on productive activities instead of trying to protect themselves against inflation. Essentially it is a question of price stability being a necessary condition for an efficient payment system, as I said earlier. In addition, the period of low and stable inflation has also been characterised in many countries by less fluctuations in growth in the real economy than was previously the case. The differences compared with developments during the inflationist and unstable 1970s, often entitled “The Great Inflation”, have been so notable that this development has been awarded its own title in academic research – “The Great Moderation”6. Although the reasons for the greater real economic stability are not entirely clear; there are hypotheses that economies have undergone various types of structural changes which have subdued the fluctuations – such as improved stock management among companies and financial innovations – or that the shocks to the economies have quite simply been smaller than during the 1970s. However, it is most likely that a better monetary policy has played some role in the increased real economic stability.  We have thus established what a central bank’s primary tasks should be: to maintain price stability, to promote stability in the financial system and – as long as the nominal anchor formed by the price stability target is not threatened – to try to stabilise the real economy. There may nevertheless be reason to provide an example of what is not an appropriate objective for a central bank.  As I have tried to emphasise, the real economic objectives that central banks have entail stabilising real quantities such as production and employment. By stabilising I mean that one tries to reduce the fluctuations around the long-term trend. However, it is important to realise that this long-term trend development is not something that monetary policy can directly influence. For example, a country’s long-term growth is determined by developments in the quantity of labour and real capital and technological progress. The best that monetary policy can do is, as I have already observed, to indirectly contribute to favourable economic developments by ensuring that inflation is kept low and stable and that financial stability is good. Although it might be tempting, it is therefore meaningless – and often counter-productive or even damaging – to give the central bank the task of "creating" growth or employment. If one tries to affect growth and employment by systematically keeping interest rates low and increasing liquidity in the economy, or by allowing public sector projects to be financed directly by the central bank, the profits will be only short term. Inflation will rise in a way that will sooner or later become difficult to control – the nominal anchor will loosen – while developments in the real economy risk being poorer than they would have been otherwise. I believe that it is correct to claim that a lack of insight and excessive                                                       5  See, for instance, Bernanke, B.S., (2006), ”The Benefits of Price Stability”, Remarks at The Center for Economic Policy Studies and on the occasion of the 75th Anniversary of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University, February 24. 6  See, for instance, Bernanke, B.S., (2004), “The Great Moderation”, Remarks at the Meetings of the Eastern Economic Association, Washington, DC, February 20.

optimism regarding the role monetary policy can play in long-term real economic growth was one important reason why inflation was so high during the 1970s. The value of independence How can one then construct a framework for monetary policy that provides the central bank with the best possible conditions to carry out its tasks? Here I intend to be fairly brief as this is something that will be discussed in more detail in the next contribution to this conference. Let me just note that there is currently general agreement that the central bank should be given the opportunity to work independent of the political system in order to attain the objective of price stability. It has been observed that if monetary policy is conducted at arm’s length from party politics, there is greater confidence in the price stability objective. This is linked to the fact that there has often been a tendency for politicians to use monetary policy for more short-term purposes which have conflicted with the long-term price stability objective and which have often entailed loosening the nominal anchor. Making the central bank independent is probably the element of the past decades’ monetary reform process that has triggered the most debate and has been perceived as the most controversial. It is probably natural for politicians to feel uncomfortable giving the central bank increased independence as it unavoidably means that they give up some of their decision-making powers, and moreover in a field perceived to be central. I assume that this is one explanation why, for instance, it took Sweden until 1999 before there was sufficient political support to grant the Riksbank increased formal independence and to confirm by law the price stability objective, despite the fact that these reforms had been proposed when the inflation target was introduced in 1993. However, the concern among politicians over making central banks independent is quite unwarranted. The independence does not, of course, mean that the central bank is free to conduct any monetary policy they wish; it only means that it should be able to use the means at its disposal to meet the objectives set by the political system without outside intervention. This is usually expressed as the central bank being instrument independent but not goal independent. The delegation of powers should be regarded as a means for politicians to ensure that the long-term aim of the monetary policy that they endeavour to achieve – but have difficulty guaranteeing – can become a reality. Furthermore, a natural consequence of the independence is that the central bank shall be accountable for its actions and that monetary policy shall be conducted in a transparent manner7.  It is interesting to note that, despite fairly substantial initial doubts, people have afterwards been very satisfied with the reforms implemented. Monetary policy therefore appears to have essentially delivered what was hoped for and I am not aware of any country where making the central bank more independent has been regretted.  Conclusion Let me round off. I began by saying that the State Bank of Vietnam is currently in a situation similar to that of the Swedish Riksbank just over a decade ago. However, it is also the case that the conditions are different in certain respects. One difference is that the Swedish credit and money markets had been deregulated completely during the 1980s and early 1990s. This meant, for instance, that the central government issued bonds, through public auctions and at predetermined times, and actively attempted to promote the development of a secondary market. Thus, there was already a clear channel through which monetary policy could have an effect. Another difference was that we in Sweden had the support of a long tradition of comprehensive production of public statistics that made our work easier. These are factors that, as I understand it, do not apply to the same extent here in Vietnam, at least not yet. Vietnam has thus – like all countries – its own special conditions that may need to be taken into account and may make it difficult to formulate monetary policy as an exact blueprint of the system in                                                       7  For a detailed discussion of “central bank transparency”, see, for instance, Chapter 1 of Blinder, A.S., (2004), The Quiet Revolution – Central Banking Goes Modern, Yale University Press. 6 BIS Review 21/2006 
another country8. However, I would like to say nevertheless that the principles which guide monetary policy in modern central banks, and which I have described here, are so general that they should be able to act as guiding stars for monetary policy reform work anywhere in the world.  Essentially it is a question of giving the central bank carefully specified – and realistic – objectives, granting it independence in its endeavours to meet the objectives and ensuring that it carries out its work in a transparent manner and is accountable for its actions.  It is my conviction that reforms based on these principles will be beneficial to Vietnam, too. Thank you.                                                       8  It can be noted, for instance, that Camen, U. and H. Genberg, (2005), ”An Inflation Targeting Regime for Vietnam”, paper prepared for the VERCON First Annual Conference, Hanoi, May 24, draw the conclusion that the conditions for introducing ”full fledged inflation targeting” have not yet been fulfilled in Vietnam.

Toshihiko Fukui: New framework for the conduct of monetary policy - toward achieving sustainable economic growth with price stability Summary of a speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Tokyo,16 March 2006.  *      *      * Introduction  At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held on March 8 and 9, 2006, the Bank of Japan decided to terminate the quantitative easing policy, which had been maintained during the five years since March 2001. The Bank shifted the operating target of money market operations from the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank to a short-term interest rate, namely, the uncollateralized overnight call rate. It also introduced a new framework for the monetary policy conduct, including clarification of its thinking on price stability.  Today, I will focus on the background to the termination of the quantitative easing policy by looking back on economic and financial developments during the past few years, and explain the Bank's future monetary policy conduct.  I. Embarking on a sustainable growth path  Japan's economy continues to recover steadily. The current economic expansion started in January 2002 and has lasted for more than four years, according to the Cabinet Office's reference dates of business cycles. The recent recovery is well balanced in terms of the balance between domestic and external demand, and also between the corporate and household sectors. Although the recovery is not accelerating, the foundation for economic growth is solid, and its resistance to various external shocks has been increasing. The present phase of the recovery is the third since the bursting of the economic bubble. Unlike the previous two phases, this time we may reasonably expect the current expansionary phase to last longer and to be more sustainable. Japan's economy has, at last, succeeded in emerging from its prolonged adjustment phase, which continued for more than a decade, and has embarked on a sustainable growth path with price stability.  Several factors support this view. In addition to external factors, such as the continuing expansion of overseas economies, on the domestic side structural reforms have made significant progress in both the business and financial sectors. Moreover, the positive effects of the recovery are spreading to the household sector. I will now discuss these contributing factors and then go into some detail regarding the sustainability of the current economic recovery.  A. Progress in structural reforms  The most important factor contributing to the achievement of sustained economic recovery has been the elimination of the burdens, or adjustment pressures, in the corporate sector and the financial system, which have hindered the Japanese economy's movement to a sustainable growth path ever since the bursting of the economic bubble.  As a result of stringent corporate restructuring efforts that lasted for more than a decade, the excesses in debt, employment, and production capacity -- the so-called "three excesses" -- have for the most part been dispelled and resolved. According to the latest Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan), the number of firms perceiving their production capacity as excessive is almost equal to the number perceiving it as insufficient for the first time since the early 1990s. The number of firms perceiving their holdings of labor as insufficient has already exceeded the number perceiving them as excessive, indicating that firms perceive a tightening of the labor market. This tightness is also evidenced by the ratio of job offers to applicants, which has exceeded 1.00. Turning to firms' debt levels, the ratio of interest-bearing debt to sales peaked out around 1993, and is currently as low as that seen in the mid-1980s, before the bubble era.  While taking measures to resolve the "three excesses," firms have been reviewing their business lines based on the principle of "selection and concentration" in the face of intensified global competition. More specifically, firms have adopted an active management approach by concentrating on strategic BIS Review 20/2006 1 
areas of business and establishing business tie-ups to improve their ability to generate high-value-added products and services. As a result, firms have succeeded in substantially improving their profitability. Corporate profits have increased for the three consecutive years from fiscal 2002, and are expected to continue to increase in the current fiscal year. Firms' ratio of current profits to sales has already exceeded the peak marked during the bubble era. Using the high level of corporate profits, firms are actively investing in research and development and expanding production capacity in order to boost market competitiveness. These activities are evident in increases in business fixed investment, regardless of the type and size of firm.  Improvements are also notable in the financial system. The nonperforming-loan (NPL) problem that has plagued Japan's economy for so long has by and large been resolved, and the stability of the Japanese financial system has been restored. The lending attitude of financial institutions has become more active as a result of improvements in their profitability and capital adequacy ratios due to the decrease in the amount of NPLs. The amount outstanding of lending by private banks, which had long been on a downward trend, finally turned upward on a year-on-year basis in August 2005 after an adjustment for securitization of loans and loan write-offs. Since then, the pace of increase has been gradually accelerating. In the previous two recovery phases, weakness in the financial system hindered the economy from moving onto a sustainable growth path. At present, however, the financial system has recovered to a level of soundness sufficient to firmly support the achievement of sustained economic growth.  B. Spread of improvement in the corporate sector to the household sector  In order to realize a sustainable economic recovery, it is important for a virtuous cycle to operate in the economy, wherein the improvement in income of the corporate sector spreads to the household sector, and this in turn feeds back to the corporate sector. Unfortunately, in past recovery phases, such a virtuous cycle did not fully operate, as both the corporate sector and the financial system were subject to structural adjustment pressure. In contrast, in the current recovery phase, apparent improvement in the employment and income situation has been observed since the beginning of 2005, and a longer and more sustainable recovery is expected in the household sector.  Firms have been increasing their numbers of employees, as the adjustment in excessive holdings of labor has progressed. Initially, they relied mainly on part-time workers in order to restrain labor costs, but firms have begun to gradually increase their numbers of regular employees, as the labor market has tightened. Wages per worker have also been rising, reflecting such conditions in the labor market. Specifically, regular payments have recently begun to increase in addition to continuing growth in overtime payments and bonus payments. This improvement in the employment and income situation, coupled with a rise in stock prices and an increase in dividend income, has contributed to income growth in the household sector. With such income conditions, private consumption has been solid. It is expected to remain so, supported by the increase in household income. This development is expected to accelerate the virtuous cycle further as the firmness in private consumption feeds back to the corporate sector.  As seen from what I have described, Japan's economy continues its solid recovery, but this recovery is often said to not apply evenly across small firms and regional economies. In fact, the degree of recovery still varies according to size of firm and region.  The economic recovery has indeed been spreading steadily, with both domestic and external demand continuing to increase. The Tankan indicated that business conditions at not only large firms but also small and medium-sized ones have been improving. The Bank's branches conduct research and interviews so as to grasp the state of regional economies, and the results are presented at the meeting of general managers of the Bank's branches. The results show that, although there still is a difference in the degree of recovery, all regional economies are showing improvement. The Bank will continue to pay due attention to future developments in regional economies.  II. Improvement in the environment for prices  The environment for prices has become favorable reflecting the continuing economic recovery. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, excluding fresh food) had been negative since 1998, but returned to 0.0 percent in October 2005 and turned positive in November. According to the figure released on March 3, 2006, it rose further in January 2006, reaching 0.5 percent. This was partly attributable to the dissipation of temporary factors such as the reduction of 2 BIS Review 20/2006 
telephone charges implemented in 2005 and also to high crude oil prices, but more importantly, fundamental factors that affect price developments clearly began to improve and started to exert upward pressure on prices.  First, the supply-demand balance is improving gradually and improvement is expected to continue, as the economy continues to recover at a pace slightly above its potential. Second, although unit labor costs continue to be driven down by the productivity increase, with wages beginning to rise, the rate of decline has been diminishing and this trend is expected to continue. And third, firms' and households' expectations of inflation have been gradually revised upward, as indicated by various surveys.  All of this indicates that the environment for prices has changed dramatically from the past, when a substantial output gap exerted downward pressure on prices. As the economy is expected to continue to recover steadily with a balance being maintained between domestic and external demand and between the corporate and household sectors, a positive trend in the year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices is projected to be established, albeit with some fluctuations.  As I have explained, Japan's economy has achieved substantial improvement, in terms of both economic activity and prices, and this implies that the Bank should respond to the improvement by changing its conduct of monetary policy.  III. Effects of the quantitative easing policy  The Bank displayed its resolve in continuing the quantitative easing policy for five years after introducing it in March 2001. At the time, Japan's economy was in a recessionary phase triggered by the collapse of the IT bubble around the globe. Financial institutions in Japan were also burdened by massive NPLs, and there was a high level of public anxiety concerning the stability of the financial system. In these circumstances, the economy faced a severe challenge, the potential risk of falling into a vicious cycle, or so-called deflationary spiral, in which a fall in demand reflecting deterioration of the economy causes a decline in prices and this in turn leads to a further fall in demand. To counter this situation, the Bank acted decisively and introduced the quantitative easing policy, which was unprecedented in the history of any central bank, with the aim of preventing a continuing fall in prices and establishing a foundation for achieving sustainable economic growth. I would like to elaborate on what the quantitative easing policy has contributed to Japan's economy over the past five years.  The quantitative easing policy consisted of two pillars: provision by the Bank of ample liquidity to raise the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank above the amount of reserves financial institutions are required to hold, namely, required reserves; and a commitment by the Bank to continue to provide ample liquidity until the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (excluding fresh food) registered zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis.  Provision of ample liquidity exceeding required reserves reduced very short-term interest rates to effectively zero percent and dispelled financial institutions' liquidity concern. After the introduction of the quantitative easing policy, there was no occurrence of any large-scale credit crunch, such as was observed in 1997 and 1998, and stability in financial markets was maintained despite the materialization of various shocks, including the terrorist attacks in the United States and the Iraq war as well as the injection of public funds into a major Japanese bank when the financial system was fragile.  The Bank's commitment to continue the quantitative easing policy generated expectations that the zero interest rate environment would continue for a certain period of time while consumer prices continued to decline. This is referred to as the "duration effect," that is, the effect of the Bank's commitment regarding the duration of the policy. As a result of this duration effect, the Bank's commitment contributed to keeping short- to medium-term interest rates stable at low levels.  The policy effects of dispelling the liquidity concern as well as keeping interest rates low and stable have created an accommodative environment not only in the money market and capital markets but also in corporate finance activities. Bank lending rates, for example, have continued to decline partly reflecting the decrease in the credit premium, and are around historically low levels, despite the ongoing economic recovery.  As mentioned earlier, Japanese firms, after strenuous efforts, have tackled structural problems such as the "three excesses," and are becoming increasingly active in undertaking business fixed investment. The accommodative financial environment created by the quantitative easing policy has been firmly supporting such developments. It could be said that the policy has contributed to improving BIS Review 20/2006 3 
the rate of return on capital and to raising corporate profits, as it enabled lending rates to decline even while the economic outlook was gradually brightening. These improvements in the corporate sector have, with a certain lag, been exerting positive effects on the household sector, thereby supporting the continuing economic recovery and the favorable environment for price developments.  The Bank's quantitative easing policy played a significant role in the recovery of Japan's economy and in the improvement in price developments. However, amid recent economic and financial circumstances, both the effect of the quantity of liquidity to dispel liquidity concern and the duration effect through which the Bank's commitment influences interest rates are considered to have played themselves out. As the financial system has regained stability, liquidity demand at financial institutions has declined, reducing the need for the provision of funds at a level well over required reserves. In addition, the duration effect of the policy commitment has been gradually diminishing with the shortening of the expected duration of the quantitative easing policy in line with the improvement in price developments. Ultimately, the duration effect ceases to exist when the criterion that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is registering zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis is fulfilled. In short, the effects of the quantitative easing policy on economic activity and prices had already become essentially equivalent to those of an interest rate policy targeting a short-term interest rate of zero percent prior to the termination of the quantitative easing policy.  IV. Background to the termination of the quantitative easing policy  In this situation, the Bank decided to terminate the quantitative easing policy at the MPM held on March 8 and 9, 2006. The Bank decided to change the operating target of money market operations from the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank to the uncollateralized overnight call rate, and to set the guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period as follows: "The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent."  The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI has been registering zero percent or above for the four consecutive months since October 2005, and a positive trend in the rate of change in the CPI is projected to be established. Economic developments underlying the CPI also indicate that Japan's economy is likely to experience a sustained period of expansion with domestic and external demand well in balance. Based on these developments in economic activity and prices, the Bank judged that the commitment that it would continue the quantitative easing policy until the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI registers zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis had been fulfilled, and that it was therefore appropriate to terminate the unprecedented quantitative easing policy.  It must be stressed that the termination of the quantitative easing policy does not signify a tightening of monetary policy. As I have explained, the policy effects of the quantitative easing policy have already become essentially equivalent to those of an interest rate policy targeting a short-term interest rate of zero percent. Since the Bank will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent based on the new guideline for money market operations, there will be no abrupt change in monetary policy in terms of the stimulative effects of the quantitative easing policy on economic activity and prices. The effects of short-term interest rates being at effectively zero percent have increased gradually with the upturn in economic activity and prices, and they are expected to become stronger while the current guideline is maintained. Although the level of interest rates depends on developments in economic activity and prices as well as in financial markets, if it is judged that inflationary pressures are restrained as the economy follows a balanced and sustainable growth path, then the accommodative monetary environment ensuing from very low interest rates will probably be maintained for some time. The Bank will continue to offer firm support to the economy by maintaining accommodative monetary conditions.  Some might question why the Bank should terminate the quantitative easing policy if the policy effects are equivalent to those of an interest rate policy targeting a short-term interest rate of zero percent. However, the Bank made a clear commitment when it introduced the quantitative easing policy that it would continue the policy until the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI registered zero percent or higher on a sustainable basis, and market participants have been conducting transactions on this premise. The duration effect of the policy commitment could not have been achieved without market participants' confidence in the commitment. In this regard, the termination of the quantitative easing policy once the Bank judged the commitment to have been fulfilled contributes to enhancing monetary policy transparency and in turn the effectiveness of monetary policy in the long term. Putting this another way, if the Bank had continued to conduct monetary policy in line with an operating target that 4 BIS Review 20/2006 
had already essentially lost its effectiveness, this could well have caused not only increased uncertainty in financial markets but also damage to the transparency of monetary policy.  V. Conduct of money market operations for the immediate future  In conducting money market operations in the immediate future, the Bank will reduce the outstanding balance of current accounts toward a level in line with required reserves according to the new guideline for money market operations. It should be borne in mind, however, that as financial institutions have managed liquidity against the backdrop of large amounts of current account balances and extensive funds-supplying operations by the Bank for a prolonged period under the quantitative easing policy, the functioning of the money market has been somewhat impaired. As a result, financial institutions may have difficulties carrying out smooth fund management. Given these circumstances, the Bank's reduction of the current account balance will be implemented taking full account of conditions in the money market. How long it will take for the Bank to reduce the current account balance depends on the situation in the money market, but it is reasonable to expect the reduction to be carried out over a period of a few months. With respect to the complementary lending facility, which allows financial institutions to borrow short-term funds from the Bank at their request up to the amount of the collateral they pledged in advance, the Bank decided to keep the loan rate unchanged at 0.1 percent, its level prior to the termination of the quantitative easing policy. This means that the uncollateralized overnight call rate, which will be effectively zero percent in accordance with the new guideline for money market operations, will basically not exceed this ceiling of 0.1 percent even if it surges temporarily. Reduction of the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank will be managed through short-term money market operations. With respect to outright purchases of long-term Japanese government bonds, these will continue at the current amounts and frequency for some time, with due regard for the future condition of the Bank's balance sheet.  VI. Introduction of a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy  Following the latest MPM, the Bank announced the introduction of a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy, with a view to ensuring the transparency of its policy conduct given the shift from the quantitative easing policy to an interest rate policy.  Under the quantitative easing policy, the Bank conducted monetary policy in line with a commitment based on the CPI. The commitment was unprecedented in that it linked the conduct of monetary policy directly to a specific economic indicator, namely, the CPI. With the aim of generating monetary easing effects in a situation where there was no room to further reduce short-term interest rates, the Bank introduced this unprecedented policy to affect the formation of interest rates, in spite of acknowledging the concomitant sacrifice in the flexibility with which it would be able to conduct monetary policy. Such a policy measure had never previously been adopted by any central bank, and it may safely be seen as a monetary policy innovation designed by the Bank of Japan. As I explained earlier, the Bank's commitment regarding the duration of the policy had significant positive effects that operated by keeping short- to medium-term interest rates stable at low levels and maintaining an accommodative environment for corporate financing. However, at the same time, the policy to some extent undermined the pricing function of financial markets.  With the prospects for sustainable economic growth with long-term price stability, monetary policy in general should be conducted in a forward-looking manner -- in other words, it should be implemented taking future developments in economic activity and prices fully into consideration -- and it should be both flexible and timely. In the current situation where the economy is emerging from a prolonged period of structural adjustment and moving toward a path of sustainable growth, a new framework should be introduced to ensure that monetary policy is conducted both appropriately and with sufficient transparency. Given the Bank's thinking about the conduct of monetary policy, market participants, for their part, should have their own views on interest rate developments and thereby make decisions on financial transactions, by forecasting the future course of monetary policy based on their assessment of economic activity and prices. Such a process will facilitate the proper functioning of pricing mechanisms in financial markets and in turn generate economic dynamism through the efficient allocation of funds.  Three elements underlie the new framework for the conduct of monetary policy.  BIS Review 20/2006 5 
First, the Bank has clarified its thinking on price stability, which is a stated objective of monetary policy. Specifically, the Bank has made public its basic thinking on price stability, and, as regards the conduct of monetary policy, it has disclosed a level of the inflation rate that its Policy Board members currently understand as price stability from a medium- to long-term viewpoint.  Second, the Bank has explained the two perspectives from which it examines economic activity and prices in determining how to conduct monetary policy.  Third, the Bank has decided that, after deliberations from these two perspectives, it will outline its thinking on the conduct of monetary policy for the immediate future, and, as a rule, disclose it periodically in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report).  Now I will elaborate on these three elements.  A. Clarifying the Bank's thinking on price stability  The Bank of Japan Law stipulates the objective of monetary policy as "contributing to the sound development of the national economy" "through the pursuit of price stability." In accomplishing this stated objective, it is thus very important for the Bank to clearly indicate to the public its thinking on price stability.  Price stability can be defined as a state where various economic agents including households and firms are able to make decisions regarding economic activities such as consumption and investment without being concerned about fluctuation in the general price level. When considering what constitutes price stability for the purposes of conducting monetary policy, central banks should take full account of the distinctive features of their countries' economic structures and how these influence the public's view of prices. In the case of Japan, one noteworthy feature regards the average rate of inflation, which, over the last a few decades, has been lower than in major overseas economies. Specifically, average inflation rates for major countries from 1985 to 2005, measured by the CPI, are as follows: 3.2 percent for the United States, 2.9 percent for the United Kingdom, 1.8 percent for Germany, and 0.6 percent for Japan. As the Japanese economy has had a protracted experience of low inflation since the 1990s, the rate of inflation at which households and firms perceive price stability seems to be low, and economic decisions are likely to be made on the premise of a similarly low-inflation environment. These features should be taken duly into consideration when conducting monetary policy.  At the latest MPM, taking into account the points I have described, there was a discussion of the level of inflation that each Policy Board member, in conducting monetary policy, currently understands as price stability from a medium- to long-term viewpoint. Such a level is referred to as a member's "understanding of medium- to long-term price stability." There was a range of views among the Policy Board members, which seemed to reflect differences between their views on the Japanese economic structure, as well as differences in their assessments of the costs of inflation and deflation. They concurred, however, that, in the current situation, the level in Japan was somewhat lower than in major overseas economies. They also agreed that, by making use of the rate of year-on-year change in the CPI to describe the understanding, an approximate range between zero and 2 percent was generally consistent with the distribution of each member's understanding of medium- to long-term price stability. Most Policy Board members' median figures fell on both sides of 1 percent. Given that the "understanding of medium- to long-term price stability" may change gradually, reflecting changes in the economic structure such as further progress in globalization and innovations in information and communication technologies, as a rule, Policy Board members will review it annually.  B. Examining economic activity and prices from two perspectives  Having clarified its thinking on price stability, the Bank's next step was to decide how to examine economic activity and prices in light of such thinking, and then to devise ways to incorporate such analysis into its conduct of monetary policy. Although it is very important to clarify the Bank's thinking on price stability, this in itself is not sufficient to develop an actual policy guideline for conducting monetary policy. The most significant issue facing any central bank, regardless of whether it has adopted inflation targeting or not, is how to provide information that will make it easier for the public to predict the future course of monetary policy and so enhance its effectiveness. For instance, suppose a central bank conducts policy based on certain mechanical rules. Although such rules would in themselves enhance the transparency of the policy, they would be incapable of coping flexibly with the various economic shocks hitting the economy. They would therefore fail to meet the original purpose 6 BIS Review 20/2006 
of enhancing transparency, which is to improve the effectiveness of monetary policy. To date, the Bank has released its assessment of the current state and outlook for economic activity and prices through the Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments and the Outlook Report. Henceforth, the Bank has decided to supplement this assessment with additional examinations of economic activity and prices from the following two perspectives, which are of particular relevance to the conduct of monetary policy, and then to release them.  The first perspective involves examining, as regards economic activity and prices one to two years in the future, whether the outlook deemed most likely by the Bank follows a path of sustainable growth under price stability.  It should be added that, in order to implement the appropriate policy for achieving sustainable growth and price stability, it is not sufficient merely to assess the economic and price situation according to the first perspective. Needless to say, any forecast entails uncertainty. It is for this reason that the Bank's Outlook Report contains detailed descriptions with regard to upward and downward risks affecting the scenario deemed most likely by the Bank. Among risk factors, there are those that will have a significant impact on economic activity and prices should they materialize, even though the likelihood of materialization is low. Such risks include that of falling into a deflationary spiral, or conversely, the risk of sparking inflation or generating an asset price bubble. In conducting monetary policy, the Bank needs to do its utmost to prevent the materialization of such potential risks.  The economic projection described in the Outlook Report covers a period of about one and a half to two years. There could, however, be risk factors that might affect economic activity and price development in the medium to long term, beyond the Outlook Report's projection period. Experience inside and outside Japan shows that wide swings in asset prices and significant changes in the financial environment, including those affecting the intermediation function of financial institutions, may impact on economic activity and price development with a considerable lag. In addition, when the public's longer-term expectations of inflation change, this can have a significant impact on the existing relationship between economic activity and prices.  The second perspective, therefore, involves examining, over a longer horizon, the various risks that are most relevant to conducting monetary policy aimed at realizing sustainable growth under price stability. Major central banks seem to share the opinion that to conduct monetary policy putting too much emphasis on achieving price stability in the short term results in large swings in economic activity, and this in turn impedes long-term price stability and the sound development of the economy.  C. Conduct of monetary policy for the immediate future  Lastly, as the third element of the new framework for the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank will outline its current view on monetary policy in light of its deliberations from the two perspectives I have described, and disclose it periodically, as a rule in the Outlook Report. On the current occasion, the Bank decided to release the results of its deliberations ahead of the release of the April Outlook Report, to coincide with the timing of the termination of the quantitative easing policy.  Looking ahead, in considering the central scenario for economic activity and prices, there is a high probability of realizing sustainable growth under price stability. As I mentioned earlier, however, against the backdrop of improving corporate profitability and a positive turn in price developments, there is a possibility that the monetary policy stimulus to economic activity and prices could be amplified via, for example, a decline in real interest rates. If the stimulus becomes too strong, there is a risk that, even if current prices are stable, investment activity could become excessive, resulting in volatile economic fluctuations. Moreover, this could negatively affect the prospects for sustainable economic growth with long-term price stability. In its conduct of monetary policy, the Bank should pay attention to this as well as other long-term risks.  Bearing this in mind, I would now like to touch on the Bank's thinking regarding the future path of monetary policy. There will be a period in which the uncollateralized overnight call rate is at effectively zero percent, followed by a gradual adjustment in light of developments in economic activity and prices. In this process, if the risk I have described remains muted, in other words, if it is judged that inflationary pressures are restrained as the economy follows a balanced and sustainable growth path, an accommodative monetary environment ensuing from very low interest rates will probably be maintained for some time.  This completes my explanation of the new framework for conducting monetary policy introduced last week. The Bank and other central banks make continuous efforts to clearly explain their thinking on BIS Review 20/2006 7 
the conduct of monetary policy to market participants and the public. The specific method employed, however, differs according to their economic environment and institutional framework. At the Bank, in introducing a new framework we studied practices at other central banks and adopted the elements that were considered relevant, but most importantly we devised the most appropriate framework for clearly explaining the conduct of monetary policy in light of Japan's economic situation. Although the new framework is different from, for example, inflation targeting, where a numerical target for price stability is set and is to be achieved within a certain time frame, nevertheless the new framework improves the transparency of the Bank's monetary policy objective by indicating its thinking on what constitutes price stability. Taking this into account, the Bank will examine economic activity and prices from the two perspectives explained earlier, and will release its view on the conduct of monetary policy for the immediate future. For Japan's economy, which has emerged from a prolonged recession and is entering a new phase, the Bank believes that the new policy framework is the most suitable for enhancing transparency and conducting monetary policy appropriately. This new framework is also expected to contribute to smooth price formation in financial markets where participants find themselves in uncharted territory with the termination of the unprecedented quantitative easing policy.  Conclusion  Today, I have elaborated on the current state of Japan's economy, which is entering a new phase, as well as providing details about the new framework for conducting monetary policy introduced last week. Under the new framework, the Bank will continue to conduct monetary policy appropriately, responding flexibly to changes in economic activity and prices, and to contribute to sustainable economic growth and price stability.  8 BIS Review 20/2006 
Arnold Schilder: Banks and the compliance challenge Speech by Professor Arnold Schilder, Chairman of the BCBS Accounting Task Force and Executive Director of the Governing Board of the Netherlands Bank, at the Asian Banker Summit, Bangkok, 16 March 2006. *      *      * Compliance risk is becoming one of the major risks banks are facing. The increasing globalization, issues with the corporate governance of complex institutions, changing laws and regulations, the understanding of what constitutes sound risk management, and the  continuous evolution of financial products create complex situations for banks that operate on a cross border basis. One may wonder whether the compliance framework in place is robust enough to effectively manage these rapidly changing factors. Creating a “best in class” compliance framework seems to be the best way forward. The development and implementation of such framework might well be a challenge equal to the implementation of Basel II. Introduction The subject of my speech is the challenges that banks face today with respect to compliance. You may wonder - why? The main reason for delivering a speech about this topic is that we have all recently seen banks involved in compliance related problems. Riggs Bank acts as a well known example of such problems. In July 2004, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs published a report on Riggs Bank. The evidence reviewed by the Subcommittee staff establishes that, since at least 1997, Riggs Bank had disregarded its anti-money laundering obligations, maintained a dysfunctional anti-money laundering programs and allowed or, at times, actively facilitated suspicious financial activity1. In a more recent case De Nederlandsche Bank, together with the relevant regulators in the United States, issued a Cease and Desist order with respect to ABN AMRO Bank. The reason for ordering this Order had to do with compliance issues. The problems ABN AMRO was faced with, albeit less far-reaching then those at Riggs Bank, act as another example of compliance related deficiencies. Another reason for this speech can be found in the publication of the paper ‘Compliance and the compliance function in banks’ published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in April 2005. In the related Press Release of 29 April 2005, BCBS Chairman Caruana said: “Compliance has emerged as a distinct branch of risk management within the banking system2.” So it is fully appropriate and timely to address this important topic in this Conference’s broader context of sound risk management in banks. Compliance risk is quickly becoming one of the major risks banks are facing. So the efforts banks should undertake concerning compliance, may become comparable in size and importance to the endeavours of banks in relation to the implementation of the new Basel II Capital Accord. However, unlike the various risks discussed by the new Capital Accord, holding additional capital to ‘cover’ compliance risks will not act as a mitigating factor. Other efforts are needed. During the first part of this speech I will briefly discuss what should be understood under compliance. Then I will go more in depth on the nature of the compliance related problems that not only banks, but the entire financial world is encountering. Subsequently, a closer look at what compliance really implies and what the international standard-setting bodies perceive as compliance. I will then discuss some issues involved in the ABN AMRO case and lessons learned. I will conclude with some broader perspectives on how to approach the challenges ahead.                                                       1  Case study involving Riggs Bank, United States Senate, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Committee on Governmental Affairs, released on 15 July 2004, page 2. 2  Press release of 29 April 2005, www.bis.org/press/p050429.htmBIS Review 20/2006 1 
Scope and definition of compliance The notion of ‘compliance’ literally means ‘obedience’ or ‘dutifulness’. It has a broad scope. As such it is known to have various interpretations. To avoid any misunderstandings during my speech, I will provide you with the definition used by the Basel Committee. In its Compliance function paper, the Committee has defined compliance risk as being “the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or loss to reputation a bank may suffer as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards, and codes of conduct applicable to its banking activities”3. Hence, compliance generally covers matters such as observing proper standards of market conduct, managing conflicts of interest and treating customers fairly. Also, compliance typically includes specific areas such as the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and may extend to tax laws that are relevant to the structuring of banking products or customer advice4. In my opinion, the compliance function should protect the institution against unlawful behaviour and strengthen its ethical consciousness.  Drivers of compliance related problems As supervisors we provide frameworks and guidance for the financial sector to facilitate the functioning of the financial world - although I am aware that our efforts may not always be perceived as such by the industry. In the end, however, the industry and supervisors serve the same goal, which is to create a stable and prosperous financial industry worldwide. It is essential that clients are confident in the solidity of financial institutions and that they are assured that their salaries paid into their bank accounts are safe. So, the industry as well as standard-setting bodies should always reflect on irregularities and consider whether the current risk control framework in place is still adequate and warrants stability. By adequate I mean that the framework should be effective for the industry as well as for the supervisory community. It is therefore essential to consider the possible underlying drivers of recent compliance related irregularities. If we look at the financial world of today, one of the greatest challenges is the rapid globalization of the world economy. New economies such as China and India are emerging, and are rapidly attracting investors and financial institutions. This globalization does not only take place in a traditional way, i.e. through businesses´ presence in the countries concerned. What I personally find fascinating is the current trend with regard to outsourcing, offshoring and ‘smart sourcing’. Not too long ago, I myself observed how service providers in India even play along with the different time zones their customers are located in by tailoring work shifts of their employees to these time zones. A first complication that globally operating financial institutions are facing as a consequence of the globalization, relates to corporate governance, and especially head office oversight. Of course, a board of directors should approve and oversee the bank’s strategic objectives, and set a desired compliance culture. Also, the board should ensure the institution has adequate policies and procedures to ensure head office oversight of the activities carried out by the various business lines. However, given the increasing complexity of ‘cross border’ institutions, this sounds easier than it is. The board should ensure that adequate controls are in place to oversee the decisions made by its senior management, and to ensure that the entire organisation acts in line with the set objectives, and the desired compliance culture. This raises all kinds of organisational and managerial questions, varying from the amount of autonomy that the business lines should have, to issues with regard to control frameworks and reporting lines. There is no easy answer. Secondly, financial institutions have to make sure that they comply with applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate. As a result of the increasing globalization, financial institutions nowadays have to make sure that they are compliant with laws that have extraterritorial effects. These different legal requirements pose a challenge for institutions operating cross border. Another challenge is that our understanding of what constitutes sound operational management is continuously changing. What we all understood to be sound operational management five years ago                                                       3  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 3. 4  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 4. 2 BIS Review 20/2006 
no longer applies. The recent best practices papers produced by the Basel Committee sustain the view that the understanding of adequate operational management is rapidly changing5. The number of standards and regulations that banks have to adhere to, is tremendous and not by definition in accordance with how banks in practice have been conducting their businesses. The development of new products and the increasing complexity of the products being offered by financial institutions, are making life even more difficult. The specific risks of these complex products and their global distribution, should be analyzed by banks and be included in their global risk management framework. Given the ongoing evolution of the financial markets in Asia, it is essential for your institutions, like ours, to analyze the compliance risks that relate to the financial products sold by them, especially since these products will continue to evolve. The increasing globalization, issues with the corporate governance of complex institutions, the continuously changing understanding of what constitutes sound operational management, changing laws and regulations, as well as the ongoing evolution of products - combined with a determination with governments and regulators to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal financial transactions - all create complex situations for banks that operate cross border. The unavoidable conclusion is that banks need to address these compliance challenges in their risk management programs on a global basis, and that the most stringent requirement quickly becomes the benchmark. When reflecting on these challenges, one may wonder whether the compliance framework in place is robust enough to effectively manage the challenges and risks that financial institutions face. What, then, are the latest developments concerning such compliance framework? Closer look at compliance During the last couple of years, various international standard-setting bodies have published papers on compliance related issues. For instance, as a response to the increasingly sophisticated money-laundering techniques the Financial Action Task Force has revised its recommendations in 2003. Also, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a paper on customer due diligence in 2001 and the Consolidated Know Your Customer paper in 20046. The cause for these papers was that supervisors around the world were increasingly recognizing the importance for banks to have adequate controls and procedures in place so that they know the customers who they are dealing with. Also, the Basel Committee published a paper on the compliance organization and the compliance function in 2005. This paper provides guidance on embedding a compliance organization within credit institutions. The compliance definition used by the Basel Committee considers the sanctions, or loss to reputation, that an institution may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations and standards. As the laws, regulations and standards are continuously changing, compliance becomes a moving target. The question that arises from this observation is that one should continuously ask oneself: “how can I be sure that my organization is compliant”? The changes occur at such a high-speed that one may well be “compliant” today but no longer so tomorrow. Today’s challenges are tomorrow’s history. The Compliance function paper emphasizes that compliance starts at the top. Compliance will be most effective - if not, will only be effective - in a corporate culture that emphasizes standards of honesty and integrity. The board of directors and senior management should lead by example. The tone at the top is vital for a culture of awareness. The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the bank’s compliance risk. To this end, the board or a committee of the board should at least once a year assess the extent to which the bank is managing its compliance risk effectively7. Having said this, compliance requires continuous attention of the board of directors and senior management; its responsibilities are not limited to the yearly assessment. Compliance implies a great                                                       5  E.g. papers published by the Basel Committee on the internal audit function, compliance function, operational risk and (very recently) corporate governance. 6  Customer due diligence for banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, October 2001, Consolidated KYC Risk Management, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, October 2004. 7  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 14 et seq. BIS Review 20/2006 3 
involvement of the board of directors, especially since it is widely accepted that the board is ultimately responsible for the operations and soundness of a bank8. Without disclaiming the ultimate responsibilities of the board of directors, the responsibility for the effective management of the bank’s compliance risk resides with the bank’s senior management. One of the most important responsibilities of senior management with regard to compliance is to make sure that the main compliance risk issues an institution is facing, are identified and assessed on an annual basis. Subsequently, senior management - with the assistance of the compliance function - has to ensure that plans are prepared to manage these risks. Such plans should address any shortfalls (policy, procedures, implementation or execution) related to how effectively existing compliance risks have been managed, as well as the need for any additional policies or procedures do deal with new compliance risks identified as a result of the annual compliance risk assessment9. This risk assessment, together with the subsequent introduction of improvements to the control framework, form an essential step in the ongoing process to ensure adequate control of the risks banks are faced with. Aside from the responsibilities of the board of directors and senior management, the paper also mentions principles concerning the status and responsibilities of the compliance function. It is essential that the compliance function has a formal status within a bank. This in order to give the compliance function the appropriate standing, authority, and independence10. The responsibilities of the compliance function should be to assist senior management in managing effectively the compliance risks faced by the bank. Specifically this means that the compliance function should: • advise senior management; • provide guidance and education to employees on compliance issues;  • identify, measure and assess compliance risks; and  • monitor and test compliance and report the findings through the reporting line in accordance with the bank’s internal risk management procedures.  Once more, I would like to stress the importance of timely identification, measurement and assessment of compliance risks. Citing the Compliance function paper “the compliance function should, on a pro-active basis, identify, document and assess the compliance risks associated with the bank’s business activities, including the development of new products and business practices, the proposed establishment of new types of business or customer relationship, or material changed in the nature of such relationships”. The paper continues by stating that the compliance function should consider ways to measure compliance risk (e.g. by using performance indicators) and use such measurements to enhance compliance risk assessment. It should assess the appropriateness of the bank’s compliance procedures and guidelines, promptly follow up any identified deficiencies and formulate proposals for amendments11. Institutions are expected to tailor their control measures to the risk classification of both their clients, and their products and to implement specific control measures for the nature and severity of the compliance risks posed by each category. Therefore, the question that each one of you will need to answer for his or her organisation is: “how can I be sure that my organisation is compliant?” The ABN AMRO case12Recently, the importance of an adequate compliance function was illustrated by events that took place within ABN AMRO, one of the largest credit institutions headquartered in the Netherlands, and one of the large internationally operating banks worldwide.                                                       8  Enhancing corporate governance for banking organisations, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, February 2006, paragraph 17. 9  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 18. 10  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 22. 11  Compliance and the compliance function in banks, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, April 2005, paragraph 37 et seq. 12  This section is based on publicly available information, www.dnb.nl, www.federalreserve.org, www.abnamro.com. 4 BIS Review 20/2006 
Those of you who have read ABN AMRO’s press release of 19 December 2005, the related website publications of the regulators in The Netherlands and the United States, or subsequent press publications, may already be familiar with this case. However, for those of you that are not, I’ll provide a brief overview. In July 2004, ABN AMRO signed a so-called Written Agreement with US banking regulators concerning compliance-related deficiencies, identified by the regulators at the US dollar clearing activities of ABN AMRO in New York. These deficiencies were related to cases of non-compliance with the United States’ Bank Secrecy Act and OFAC regulations (the United States’ sanction regime). This Written Agreement, that addressed ABN AMRO’s anti-money laundering policies, procedures and practices, was designed to correct these deficiencies. In response to this Written Agreement, ABN AMRO strengthened its compliance function and its anti-money laundering programme in New York. Many measures were taken to achieve a best-in-class compliance programme. These measures varied from a centralisation and increase of its compliance function to the implementation of new IT-support systems. Nevertheless, during the remediation process ABN AMRO itself identified other shortcomings in one of its overseas offices. Investigations from its audit department revealed that certain employees of the branch, without the enforcement or knowledge of anyone outside the branch, were not observing the bank’s policies and standards in relation to certain US dollar payment instructions sent to the bank’s US dollar clearing centre in New York on behalf of Libyan and Iranian clients. Under EU legislation, ABN AMRO was allowed to have dealings with said counterparties. Nonetheless, the United States’ OFAC regime imposed certain limitations. Further investigations by the bank made it clear that these procedures were aimed at not including certain client-specific information from the relevant payment instructions. As such, it was ensured that the payments would pass through the New Yorkbranch’ OFAC filter without being detected and blocked. Having been informed by ABN AMRO about these procedures, the United States bank regulators and De Nederlandsche Bank concluded that this constituted a pattern of unsafe and unsound practices warranting further enforcement action13. On 19 December 2005, an “Order to Cease and Desist” was issued by the joint regulators, requiring ABN AMRO to undertake comprehensive additional measures - in addition to the measures it had already undertaken in response to the Written Agreement. Amongst others, these additional measures related to: • the submission of a U.S. Law Compliance Programme, ensuring continuous compliance with state and federal laws of the United States;   • the improvement of Head Office oversight to ensure effective control over and supervision of its foreign branches; and  • the completion of a written plan to improve the effectiveness of the management oversight in the United States. On top of the “Cease and Desist Order”, the USbank regulators imposed a fine amounting to US dollar 75 million, and a voluntary endowment of US dollar 5 million to the Illinois Bank Examiners´ Education Foundation. Lessons learned It goes without saying that ABN AMRO’s Supervisory Board and its Managing Board respectively, have ordered detailed analyses of the compliance-related incidents, to ensure the lessons learned would be beneficial in the future. In addition to the institutions themselves, the regulatory community must learn from such incidents as well. Given the severe impact of such incidents, it is important that the regulatory community and financial institutions reflect on whether the so-called “principle based” approach is adequate in this area. The reality is that appropriate compliance means adhering to many rules in various jurisdictions. So even if supervisors apply a principle based approach, at least the financial institutions themselves need to                                                       13  Page 3 of the Order to Cease and Desist Issued upon Consent issued by De Nederlandsche Bank and the US Regulators. BIS Review 20/2006 5 
couple this with rule based instructions. Some banks have introduced a mix of risk-based and rule-based compliance programs. My point is that both supervisors and the industry need to reflect on their paradigms. It is not either principles or rules, but rather an intelligent combination of principles and rules. Another issue that warrants further consideration is that of “awareness cultivation”. It is widely believed that compliance should always be at the forefront of the employees’ thinking. Nevertheless, the modification of US dollar payment instructions acts as an example of deliberate attempts of employees to dodge internal and external regulations. Clearly, these employees lacked the desired mindset. Training and counsel remain very important tools to create the desired mindset: it helps employees to better understand not only the requirements and regulations itself, but also the “why” of such requirements. Unfortunately, training alone will not always suffice to get the message through. It remains difficult to deal with this issue, but alternative solutions are not inconceivable. You, as senior management of supervised institutions, continue to have, of course, an exemplary role within your own organisation. This enables you to influence your staffs´ behaviour by acting as shining examples. In addition, an interesting approach that you as senior management might want to consider, relates to annual appraisals of staff members. In addition to the traditional commercial objectives that usually dominate the appraisal process, one might consider including compliance-related objectives. Such objectives, of course, remain difficult to measure and, therefore, require careful consideration; the proverb “haste makes waste” is certainly applicable here. However, the growing usage of such performance objectives by banks like ABN AMRO as a tool to further influence employees´ behaviour, illustrates that - if properly applied - they have their merits. I am convinced that the importance of such factors will continue to grow, in the Netherlandsbut also in Asia. In the end however, whereas the aforementioned factors undoubtedly contribute to the observance of internal and external requirements and regulations, it is my belief that the tool ‘par excellence’ to achieve compliance remains the combination of control and enforcement. “Control” to increase the possibility of being caught, either by internal control bodies like the audit- and the compliance function or by external authorities like the banking regulators. And “enforcement” to exact compliance with rules, regulations and other requirements. Parallel with Basel II In the beginning of my speech I made a brief comparison between compliance and the new Basel Capital Accord. I can imagine that you may wonder what the afore-mentioned has to do with the new Basel Capital Accord. And yes, there seems to be little convergence between the capital requirements laid down in the Accord, and today’s challenges with regard to compliance. There are, however, some interesting links that I would like to highlight. “Compliance risk” is swiftly becoming one of the most important risk drivers that credit institutions are facing. Firstly, not having adequate controls to prevent, for example, money laundering or terrorist financing will be unacceptable for regulators, who - as illustrated by the fines levied against ABN AMRO in the United States- will not hesitate to take formal measures against your institutions. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, involvement in serious compliance related incidents can lead to reputational damage, the impact of which may be even larger than that of regulatory interference. As confidence remains one of the financial sector’s cornerstones, a substantial impairment of an institution’s reputation could very well lead to its collapse. Nevertheless, whereas the Basel Accord, of course, requires institutions to set aside capital to cover credit-, market and operational risk, “compliance risk” is not covered. Is this a missed opportunity? Should the drafting panels of the new Capital Accord have spent time on a concept like “compliance capital”? In my opinion, requiring institutions to set aside capital to cover losses from compliance incidents is not the issue. I believe that it is justified that the Basel Committee has not included compliance risk in its Capital Accord. Whereas (potential) credit losses can be financially compensated by holding additional capital, compliance incidents will not be mitigated by financial means. After all, compliance incidents will impact the reputation of a credit institution, which cannot be measured in financial terms. Compliance is not a financial matter, but a matter of principle. Nevertheless, the question about the position of compliance continues to intrigue me. 6 BIS Review 20/2006 
You will undoubtedly be aware that Pillar II (the so-called Supervisory Review Process) of the new Capital Accord deals (amongst others) with the treatment of risks that are not fully covered by the requirements under Pillar 114. Under Pillar II, the Accord requires banks to address all material risks faced in the capital assessment process, even those risks that cannot be measured or quantified precisely15. Banks are expected to further develop techniques for managing unquantifiable risks like reputational risk16. Although the language in the Capital Accord gives the impression that ‘something’ needs to be done, it also implies that holding additional capital for unquantifiable risks is not the solution. So, what then is the solution? I would argue that, whereas it remains necessary to mitigate compliance risks, a more structured and coherent approach is necessary. As previously discussed, banks are faced with challenges like the increasing globalization, issues with the corporate governance of complex institutions, the continuously changing understanding of what constitutes sound operational management, changing laws and the ongoing evolution of products. At the same time, the requirements and best practices imposed by legislators, supervisors and international standard setting-bodies are not necessarily attuned to each other. Those of you who work for an internationally active bank will recognize the difficulties that this brings to day-to-day practice. One important step towards solving these difficulties will be to bring these requirements and best practices together. This entails monitoring the implications of these requirements and best practices and putting effort in finding workable solutions and where possible to improve the consistency of standards already available. In my mind, this will be one of the bigger challenges for the supervisory and legislative community for the upcoming years. But you know that we are working hard here, amongst others through the BCBS Accord Implementation Group and the Core Principles Liaison Group. In the end such effort will as a result also entail new challenges for the banks themselves. It is widely realised that implementing the new Basel Accord is a huge burden on financial institutions, not only because of the complexity of the materials, but also because of the sheer size of the implementation project. The development and implementation of a consistent international compliance framework, might well be a challenge of equal size. New policies have to be written, approved and implemented, procedures have to be developed, IT-systems (e.g. automated systems to facilitate transaction filtering and - monitoring) have to be installed, staff members have to be trained and control measures have to be put in place to detect and correct deficiencies. The amount of work done by ABN AMRO in response to the Cease and Desist Order resulted in comprehensive and extensive plans. This is illustrative of the effort that might well be the desired benchmark for the entire financial industry. Closing remarks I have highlighted the challenges that banks are facing today with respect to compliance and the compliance function amidst the ongoing increasing globalization, issues with the corporate governance of complex institutions, the continuously changing understanding of what constitutes sound risk management, changing laws and regulations, a continuous evolution of financial products, and a determination of governments and regulators to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and other illegal financial transactions. Therefore I expect that the importance of “compliance” will continue to grow exponentially. At this moment, multiple requirements and best practices with regard to compliance have already been issued. Nevertheless, it is my view that creating a “best in class” compliance framework by integrating these requirements and best practices should become a main priority, both for regulators and the industry. I realize that this will not be easy, but I am convinced that this is the best way forward.                                                       14  Par. 724 of the new Capital Accord. 15  Par. 732 of the new Capital Accord. 16  Par. 742 of the new Capital Accord.

Erkki Liikanen: How to boost Europe's growth potential?  Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the CEPS Breakfast Meeting, Brussels, 10 March 2006. Slides for this speech can be found on the Bank of Finland’s website. *      *      * Economic growth in the EU has been sluggish in recent years, despite the robust world economy. As a matter of fact, growth has been strong in almost all parts of the world except for Western Europe.  The weak performance of the euro area economy in recent years is not due to monetary policy. On the contrary, interest rates have been very low – both the long and the short term rates. Neither can the exchange rate be blamed for the sluggish growth. The external value of the euro has not been at a level that would have hurt the overall price competitiveness of euro area industries. Therefore, we have to look elsewhere for the reasons for the unsatisfactory growth performance.  Weak demographic trends have been one of the factors restraining the growth of the EU economy compared with many other parts of the world. In the future, the negative demographic trends will continue. In addition, rising oil prices have in recent years held back growth in the EU. Unfortunately, economic policies cannot do much to reduce the effects of demographics and oil prices on growth. Luckily, however, there are also issues that economic policies can deal with in order to increase Europe's growth potential. Let us now turn to those.  It appears that the European economy has not been able to take advantage of new technologies and globalisation as effectively as the United States. The growth of labour productivity in the U.S. has exceeded that of the EU since the mid 1990s.  This table shows that the difference in productivity increases between the EU and the U.S. is largely due to developments in the IT goods producing sector, and – even more importantly – in the service sector. Within services, it is retail trade, wholesale trade, and financial services that count for most of the diverging productivity developments. These sectors are important users of IT.  Indeed, there seems to be a lot of unexploited potential in the EU when it comes to labour productivity. First of all, productivity can improve within each industry and within each firm. Secondly, aggregate labour productivity can also be raised by the exit of industries and firms with weak productivity, and the entry of those with better productivity.  Public authorities can facilitate improvements of this kind by removing obstacles to a more productive private sector. In the EU, such obstacles are largely related to national boundaries and to regulation of private businesses. Policy measures that promote competition and economic integration within the EU can significantly enhance productivity, employment, and economic growth.  The relation between competition and productivity has been the focus of a significant amount of research in recent years. Several studies suggest that an increase in competition normally increases innovation and thereby productivity (e.g. Aghion et al. 2002).1 This is because companies with monopoly power have less need to reform and to innovate.  *      *      * Apart from the effect that competition has on innovations, it also directly improves the allocation of resources in the economy. This is the beneficial characteristic of competitive markets according to basic microeconomic theory. Competition increases production and lowers prices.  A few recent studies investigate the macroeconomic benefits from economic reforms that promote competition. These studies utilise modern dynamic general equilibrium models. Simulations performed with such models show the effects of increases in competition, essentially starting from the effects that are familiar from the basic microeconomic theory.                                                        1  Aghion, Philippe – Bloom, Nicholas – Blundell, Richard – Griffith, Rachel – Howitt, Peter (2002): Competition and Innovation: An Inverted-U Relationship. NBER Working Paper No. 9269. BIS Review 19/2006 1 
One of these studies focuses on the euro area. It investigates how increases in competition affect the euro area itself, as well as the rest of the industrial world.2 It is assumed that competition increases in the product and labour markets. In the language of the model, this means that mark-ups diminish in prices and wages. The mark-ups are defined as the deviations of prices and wages from the theoretical case of perfect competition. The study assumes that competition in the euro area increases so much that it reaches the estimated level of the U.S. economy. This means that the price mark-up declines by 12 percentage points (35 % → 23 %) and the wage mark-up by 14 percentage points (30 % → 16 %). The central results of the study are shown in this slide.  The slide shows the long-run effects of increased competition: first, in the product market and, second, in the labour market. The combined effect is shown in the last column of the table. Production, consumption, and employment are increased in each case. In addition, investment expands, as the increase in production requires an increase in the capital stock. One should note that the table does not show the values of the variables as such, but it shows how much they differ from the baseline case of no change in the level of competition.  It is assumed in the study that there is a very significant increase in competition. Therefore, the estimated consequences are dramatic. Euro area GDP increases by as much as 12.4 % in the case presented in the last column of the table. The product market reform has greater effects than the labour market reform, particularly on production and investment. Regarding employment, the effect of the labour market reform is almost as large. Outside the euro area, there are some positive spill-over effects. This is partly because foreign consumers benefit from the decline in the prices of the goods produced in the euro area.  One way to look at the results of the study is to consider what they tell us about the possible future adjustment of the U.S. current account. According to the results, competition enhancing reforms in the euro area would make the adjustment less painful for the euro area itself, as well as for the rest of the world.  In Finland, increases in competition would benefit the economy in much the same way as in the case of the whole euro area. This is shown by a simulation study made in the Bank of Finland. The study uses a dynamic general equilibrium model of the Finnish economy, the AINO model of the Bank of Finland. Again, the effects of increased competition in the product and labour markets are studied. The results are briefly reported in the Bank of Finland Bulletin, the first issue of 2005. The results are summarised in this slide.  The slide shows the effects of decreases in the price and wage mark-ups in the Finnish economy. Both the short-run and the long-run effects are shown. The long-run effects are smaller than those in the previous slide. This is because in the study concerning Finland, the assumed increase in competition is much smaller. The price mark-ups are assumed to decline by 2 percentage points and the wage mark-ups by 5 percentage points. Two-thirds of the increase in GDP is due to the increase in competition in the product markets, and one-third is due to the increased competition in the labour market.  Again, one should note that the figures in the slide do not show the values of the variables as such, but rather their deviations from the baseline case of no change in competition. For example, the level of real wages after two years is 0.4 % higher than what it would have been without the increase in competition.  The next slide shows how the effects of increased competition propagate in the economy.  In the long run, increased competition boosts production, consumption, and employment. Obviously, the increase in competition does not benefit every agent in the economy. There is a decrease in the profits of the firms that face a reduction in their monopoly power. Also, the short run developments are affected by the fact that resources shift from production of consumer goods to production of investment goods. This is because there is an early increase in investment due to the need for a larger capital stock to support the long-run increase in the level of GDP. Indeed, consumption is decreased in the short run. However, in the long run it increases by almost as much as GDP.                                                        2  Bayoumi, Tamim – Laxton, Douglas – Pesenti, Paolo (2004): Benefits And Spillovers Of Greater Competition In Europe: A Macroeconomic Assessment. NBER Working Paper No. 10416. 2 BIS Review 19/2006 
Of course, these model simulations only provide rough estimates of the effects of economic reforms. However, the qualitative results are clear: an increase in competition boosts GDP and welfare. One should also keep in mind that these results are only based on the direct effects that the degree of competition has on resource allocation. As I mentioned earlier, competition also increases innovation and thereby productivity. This effect comes on top of those indicated by the studies just discussed.  *      *      * As I already pointed out, the growth of labour productivity in the service sector has been slower in Europe than in the U.S., and the financial services production is among the sectors with the largest differences in productivity performance. Moreover, when discussing Europe's growth potential, the development of the financial services sector is far more important than what its direct contribution to productivity growth would suggest. The development of financial services is crucial to the dynamism of Europe's economy.  The function of financial services and financial markets in the economy is twofold. First, banks, capital markets, and other parts of the financial system play a central role in evaluating, trimming, and promoting innovations and business ideas. In this way, the financial sector takes part in developing the economy, while at the same time it acts as an intermediary supplying financing to those who need it. The second central task of the financial sector is related to payment systems. They form the basic structure that makes the financial markets to operate as one entity. Without well-functioning payment systems markets would be fragmented: locally, regionally, or nationally. Broad and competitive financial markets are impossible without an efficient and a unified payment system.  Financial integration within the EU offers great opportunities to improve Europe's growth potential. The integration promotes economic growth for several reasons:  • First of all, the required return on an investment project is reduced, because financing is available at a lower price. This increases investment and employ-ment.  • Second, consumers benefit directly from smaller interest rate margins and decreased service fees.  • Third, a greater variety of financial services becomes available. This adds to the benefits of the customers of the financial services sector.  • In addition, financial integration increases the stability of the EU economy, because an integrated financial system balances risks between countries. The effects of country specific fluctuations are dampened and shared more evenly, as the cross border ownership and trade of financial claims increase. In the U.S., a significant part of so called asymmetric region specific income fluctuations are neutralised through the integrated financial system.  The common monetary policy creates another, specific need for the euro area financial system to be as integrated as possible. Integration reduces the asymmetry of the effects of monetary policy across countries.  Today, we have a common monetary policy but we do not have an integrated internal market for financial services.  A lot has already been done within the EU to promote financial integration. An important instrument in this process has been the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP). It contains 42 measures, and almost all of them have been adopted at the EU level. However, the national implementation of many of the measures is still incomplete. A continuation to the FSAP in the form of further measures has already been discussed.  Ultimately, the integration of the EU financial system, however, will not result from authorities' actions or regulation. Integration is realized when the market participants change their way of doing business. The task of the authorities is to remove obstacles to integration and to take care of the development of the regulatory and supervisory framework. The three main areas where financial integration should proceed are all related to market infrastructures. The first is to create a common European market in retail banking. Here, the development of payment systems plays an important role. Secondly, securities clearing and settlement systems need to be made more integrated and efficient. The third area where progress is most needed is the integration and coordination of financial supervision. Of these three areas, I will next briefly focus on securities trade.  BIS Review 19/2006 3 
A problem in the securities markets is their current lack of depth and integration. An important challenge is the fragmentation of clearing and settlement systems. It is an important factor behind the high price of securities transactions in Europe.  This applies particularly to trade in equities. The cost of an equity transaction across national borders but within the EU can be as much as four times the cost of a similar transaction in the U.S. It is exactly these costs that prevent the integration of equity markets. They hurt the issuer of a stock via reducing its price. The provider of financial services, in turn, faces higher costs. The infrastructure of the markets has too strong an effect on the location of transactions and businesses. In this situation, current national features of the clearing and settlement systems should be evaluated from the point of view of their future in the integrating European market.  4 BIS Review 19/2006 
Süreyya Serdengeçti: Inflation targeting – performance and challenges Opening speech by Mr Süreyya Serdengeçti, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the Conference on Inflation Targeting: Performance and Challenges, Istanbul, 19 January 2006. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all. It is a great honor for me to open this conference entitled “Inflation Targeting: Performance and Challenges”. I am very pleased to host such distinguished guests and I’d like to thank you all for joining us here in Istanbul and share your knowledge and experience on inflation targeting. The inflation targeting regime has been adopted by a growing number of countries, especially by emerging market countries, in the last fifteen years. As economic and political conditions of emerging market countries have generally been considered as vulnerable and unstable, these countries perceive inflation targeting as a credible and a safe “way out”, after the successful experiences of industrialized countries. Turkey is now the newest member of the club. We have studied the experiences of more than 20 industrialized and emerging market countries as we were working on the general framework of the inflation targeting regime for Turkey. Along with these experiences, historical, socio-political and economic dynamics of the Turkish economy have been taken into account to create a model that is specific to Turkey. I believe that those countries who will adopt this regime in the future will benefit from our experience as we did from others. With this motivation, I would like to talk now about the main characteristics of the period of transition to inflation targeting regime in this country, a period that indeed lasted longer than planned, and about the main issues that we have faced during this period. I am strongly convinced that there are important lessons that can be drawn from the Turkish experience. Distinguished guests, The Turkish economy has lived through 30 years of high and volatile inflation rates and massive dollarization together with financial sector instability, high public sector debt burden and unstable and low growth rates. Living with such weaknesses for such a long period of time has created a strong inertia in inflation dynamics. Besides, in the latter half of that period, the currency crisis of 1994, contagion effects of Asian and Russian crises in 1997 and in 1998, and finally our own financial crisis in 2001 have been among the many events that increased the vulnerability of the economy. All these developments that negatively affected economic and social life, highlighted more and more the importance of price stability as the primary goal of monetary policy and made all of us realize the importance of a transparent framework for monetary policy that has a clear nominal anchor. Accordingly, the macroeconomic policy framework has undergone major changes and some institutional arrangements have been introduced after and since the financial crisis in 2001. In this context, the floating exchange rate regime was introduced; the Central Bank Law has been amended and the primary objective of the Central Bank has been, for the first time in its history, defined as achieving and maintaining price stability. Together with these changes, a new economic program entitled “Strengthening the Turkish Economy-Turkey’s Transition Program” was launched in May 2001. This new program addressed the two main issues of chronic inflation and high public debt with tight monetary and fiscal policies backed up by structural reforms. In this environment, the Central Bank needed to introduce a transparent monetary policy regime with a clear nominal anchor to shape inflation expectations, as inflation inertia was the biggest problem and authorities lacked credibility. The choice of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor again was out of question: The exchange rate based stabilization program had been abandoned in total loss of confidence. The other option then could be to use monetary aggregates as a nominal anchor. However, they too were not good candidates for a couple of reasons: One, monetary targeting implicitly incorporates the inflation target as the ultimate objective of monetary policy and relies on a forward looking assessment when responding to shocks; the pure form of this regime considers only money and ignores the potential information contained in non-monetary variables. Two, the success of the monetary targeting regime relies on the two assumptions that the velocity of money is entirely predictable and inflation is solely determined by money growth. Unfortunately, here in Turkey we did not live in such an BIS Review 19/2006 1 
environment. It was very difficult to predict money demand under a chronically high inflation environment as it was unstable. Moreover, the link between inflation and monetary aggregates was not stable neither. The final alternative was the choice of the inflation itself as the nominal anchor and that obviously refers to the “inflation targeting regime”. In addition to having an anchor, which is highly transparent, inflation targeting was viewed to be superior to all other monetary policy regimes because all available information is used in the monetary policy decision making process. Besides these features, Fred Mishkin (2000) for instance addresses the following favorable aspects of the inflation-targeting regime:  “Because an explicit numerical target for inflation increases the accountability of the central  bank, inflation targeting also has the potential to reduce the likelihood that the central bank  will fall into the time – inconsistency trap. Moreover, since the source of time inconsistency is  often found in political pressures on the central bank to undertake overly expansionary  monetary policy, inflation targeting has the advantage of focusing the political debate on what  a central bank can do in the long run.” On the other hand, as it is widely discussed in the literature, the success of the regime depends on the fulfillment of the necessary preconditions such as central bank independence, sound and well-developed financial sector and absence of fiscal dominance. At that time, the long “fiscal dominance” history of the Turkish economy that severely restricted the efficiency of monetary policy and shallow financial markets that were not well developed were the primary characteristics of the Turkish economy. All these limited the economy’s room for maneuver on the eve of the adoption of the new monetary policy regime. Independence of the Central Bank of Turkey that came in 2001, was almost the only institutional factor in hand at that time on the way towards the ultimate objective of price stability. Given this overall framework and conditions, the Central Bank of Turkey preferred a smooth transition towards inflation targeting whereby it would wait until all these factors that restrict the efficiency of monetary policy would weaken. In early 2002 following the achievement of relative stability in financial markets after the 2001 Crisis, the Bank announced its new monetary policy regime in a public statement as implicit inflation targeting. As it was emphasized in the same now historical statement, the final aim was to adopt the full-fledged inflation targeting regime, once the preconditions were met. This ‘new’ regime was defined as inflation targeting since the central bank announced a numeric target for annual inflation jointly set by the government according to its law and price stability was now its primary objective. Furthermore, it was similar to inflation targeting in the sense that the decision making process was shaped in a forward looking manner by exploiting the broadest set of information available. However, the inflation targeting regime was also “implicit” rather than “full-fledged”, reflecting the fact that the preconditions such as a strong fiscal position of the government and further stability in the financial markets were not yet fulfilled. During the last four years, sound monetary and fiscal policies together with structural reforms, changes in the institutional framework and adaptation of the economy to floating exchange rates, however painful this might have been, have resulted in remarkable achievements on the way to price stability. During this period, the monetary policy of the Central Bank put greater and greater emphasis on ensuring the credibility of inflation targets. To this end, the Central Bank has often publicly stressed the importance of continuing with a tight fiscal policy and completing structural reforms without delay or compromise.  As a result, inflation targets have been reached for four years in a row, significantly enhancing the credibility of the monetary policy. I am so glad to be able to say that today inflation is at its lowest level in thirty-seven years. Annual CPI inflation, which was 73.2 percent as recently as January 2002, is now down to single digit figures; it stands at 7.72 percent as of end of 2005. This performance in disinflation has obviously positively affected the economy. First of all, economic growth rates have been positive again in the last four years. Not only they have been positive, but very high levels have been attained. Total growth in real terms since 2001 is 31 percent. Furthermore the pattern of economic growth has changed. Today, the main sources of growth are the improvement in productivity and increasing export performance. In addition to this, the role of the private sector in economic growth has increased considerably in the last few years. Recent Turkish experience showed that tight and prudent fiscal policy is not necessarily contractionary, especially if and when an economy is facing fiscal dominance. The economy is expected to keep its growing trend in 2006 and onward and the aim obviously is to achieve sustainable growth rates at high levels. 2 BIS Review 19/2006 
Secondly, substantial progress in financial stability has been achieved with the help of the restructuring of the banking sector. Financial markets are now deeper and much less fragile. Parallel to these achievements, both nominal and real interest rates have declined significantly. The average maturity of the Treasury issues increased considerably and Turkish Eurobond spreads, used as a proxy for the country risk premium, have dropped significantly since 2001. Volatility in exchange rates has gradually decreased thanks to the transparent and consistent operation of the floating exchange rate regime. All these together triggered the reverse-dollarization process: Though the process has been interrupted from time to time and more progress is necessary, the weight of Turkish lira denominated investments in portfolio preferences is now on an upward path. And finally, integration of the Turkish economy with the world has increased, leading to a more competitive environment in the real sector. This process together with macroeconomic stability has made it possible to sustain large current account deficits. Moreover, the quality of the financing has improved considerably as the composition of the capital account is now changing in favor of long term capital inflows and foreign direct investment. At this point, I would like to reemphasize the support of the fiscal policy as an important factor contributing to this achievement. The involvement of the government in the process first came from the fact that inflation targets have been set jointly by the Government and the Central Bank. The government’s pricing, tax and income policies have been carried out in tandem with inflation targets. Another crucial factor has been the fiscal discipline: Very high levels of primary surplus have been maintained all over the years. Thus concerns over the sustainability of the public debt stock have faded away, helping inflation expectations to be consistent with the targets, maintaining confidence in the economy and thus reducing the risk premium. The continuity of fiscal discipline and tight fiscal policies consistent with targets are critical for the credibility of the inflation-targeting regime. Thus, the support from the fiscal side is still an indispensable part of the economic program. Dear Guests, Central bank independence generally implies the ability to act free of direct political pressures when taking and implementing decisions concerning monetary policy. Parallel to this, central bank independence takes the first place in monetary policy debates especially in developing countries where lack of sustained fiscal discipline and higher inflation rates have been common. Both country experiences and economic literature have proven that there is a direct relationship between central bank independence and inflation. That is, the more independent and thus the more insulated from political pressures a central bank is, the better the country performs in terms of reducing the inflation level. The first thing that the independence of a central bank then evokes is de jure independence. Within this context, factors such as goal independence, instrument independence, rules for the appointment, term of office and discharge of high level officers, central banks’ control of their own budgets and provisions on their staff are among the important issues that can be addressed in central banks’ law. In fact, what I find particularly critical based on my experience is that independence is not a concept that can be simply achieved by legal independence. I believe achieving central bank independence is a process you live through on a daily basis and is closely related to central bankers’ stand on economic policies and stability. The new Law on the Central Bank, enacted in May 2001 in line with EU norms and central banking practices in the world, has been the most important step strengthening our Central Bank’s operational independence. By this Law, as I mentioned before, the main objective of the Bank is stated as to achieve and maintain price stability. Furthermore, the Bank is the only body responsible for conducting monetary policy. In addition, credits extended to the Treasury and other public institutions are now illegal and the Bank shall not purchase debt instruments issued by the Treasury or by public establishments and institutions in the primary market. Amendments to the Central Bank Law constitute an important institutional step taken on our way to the European Union. All of these mean the Bank determines the monetary policy and the policy instruments to be used at its own discretion. As a natural consequence of this discretion, the Bank is also required to establish the highest possible level of accountability and transparency. According to its Law, each year in April and in October the Governor appears before the Council of Ministers to explain monetary policy and operations. We also make presentations to the Parliament twice a year. Similarly, the Central Bank gives utmost importance to transparency. BIS Review 19/2006 3 
Evidently, transparency and accountability cannot be considered separately from the communication policy. Good communication appears to be an unquestionable condition for the effectiveness of monetary policy. Only in that way, the Central Bank can manage to be correctly understood by economic agents and shape expectations the way it desires. Besides, good communication plays an important role in reducing uncertainties and enhancing confidence by rendering the Central Bank’s policies more understandable and predictable. The insulation of the public communication from political pressures constitutes one of the most important aspects of good communication. In this context, the Central Bank’s informing the public about the economic situation and risks, using various communication channels, must be viewed as a significant part of its independence. In the last four years, our Central Bank has experienced a historical transformation in terms of its communication policy. It all started with carrying out a new organizational arrangement within the Bank, founding a separate department. This department has the responsibility of preparing documents and booklets, and organizing meetings and conferences to explain monetary policy as well as improving the information set provided through the web page of the Bank. What we have achieved next was to elucidate the newly established conceptual framework of monetary policy. To this aim, we have tried to explain to the public concepts such as ‘inflation targeting’, ‘price stability’, ‘floating exchange rate regime’, ‘good governance’, and ‘sustainable growth’, standard elements of textbooks and generally known only in academic circles. To make economic agents familiar with these concepts, the communication policy of the Central Bank has effectively been used on every occasion through lectures and speeches across the country. Now, we know that these concepts are much better understood by the public.  I truly believe that this good communication has played a very important role in the performance of the Central Bank in bringing down inflation. Dear Guests, Two important developments and their possible effects on the economy made us decide the year 2005 as a transition period and adopt full-fledged inflation targeting regime in 2006. First: As of January 1, 2005 we dropped six zeros from the Turkish lira. Thiswas an important development for the economy as a whole. Second: The Turkish Statistical Institution announced a change in the calculation methodology of the price indices including CPI, starting from January 2005. During 2005, in addition to these two developments, further steps were taken in order to improve conditions before starting full-fledged inflation targeting regime. We continued to develop our decision-making process towards more transparent and efficient policymaking. So, though the Monetary Policy Committee continued to be an advisory body in making policy decisions, it began to meet regularly on the pre-announced days to discuss developments on inflation and economy in 2005. Decisions on short-term interest rates of the Central Bank were made public on the following business day taking the evaluations during the meeting into account. Following the announcement of policy decisions, a report on inflation and outlook, which would include the reasoning of the decision and the views of the Committee members together with the signals on how the decisions on interest rates would evolve in the future, has been made public. Another step was the reorganization of the Research Department to fit the needs of policy design and analysis under the full fledged inflation targeting regime.  Besides, the information set that we use to forecast future inflation was further enlarged; forecast models for inflation were improved and sophisticated.  Now, let me proceed with some of the key elements of full-fledged inflation targeting regime that became effective in 2006. We decided to target the Consumer Price Index (CPI). It is an indicator easily followed by all economic agents and is an effective way of accurately measuring the cost of daily life. However, we also announced that because the CPI is affected easily by several disturbances that are not under the control of monetary policy, several core inflation indicators will also be monitored closely. We set the inflation target as a “point target” and at the same time, we set a three-year time horizon for year-end targets. The year-end targets for 2006, 2007 and 2008 are 5 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Bearing in mind the transition from 2006 onwards to a three-year government 4 BIS Review 19/2006 
budget practice, the announcement of a three-year target path is expected to increase the internal consistency of inflation targets and their harmony with other macroeconomic projections. We defined plus and minus two-percentage points around the target as an uncertainty interval. We thought that measured by a comprehensive index such as the CPI on one side and data and model uncertainty in the economy on the other side, it is not possible for the Central Bank of Turkey to ensure that inflation will not deviate more or less from the point targets. And, according to the 42nd Article of the Central Bank Law, we are accountable to communicate with the Government and the public if inflation deviates more than two percentage points on each side: “The Bank shall submit information to the Government in writing and inform the public disclosing the reasons of incapability to achieve the determined targets in due time published or the occurrence of the possibility of not achieving and the measures to be taken thereof.”  Unlike in the last four years, the Central Bank will from now on assess upward or downward deviations from the target on equal balance. This also means that an explanation will be made to the public in both substantial upward and downward deviations of inflation from the target. Indeed, as we look at other countries’ experiences, economies that have already maintained price stability, it can be considered as a poor policy management if inflation remains systematically below the target. However, for countries who aim to bring inflation down from very high levels, remaining below targets all the time can be regarded as a positive signal of the commitment to price stability for economic agents. In fact, in the last four years in the Turkish economy, keeping year-end inflation figure below the target played important role in building-up credibility of the government and the Central Bank of Turkey, considering thirty years of high inflation. Regarding changes in the decision-making process, it is important to note that the Monetary Policy Committee is now assuming a “decision-maker” role instead of an “advisory” role. Decisions regarding short-term interest rates will be subject to voting in the Monetary Policy Committee meetings in 2006. Furthermore, in line with the principle of transparency, the meeting dates of the Committee are now announced a year in advance and arranged by taking into account the data flow schedule in a month. Another important development is that the “Inflation Report” will be the main communication instrument of monetary policy. The most significant change in the report will be the inclusion of inflation forecasts of the Central Bank. Moreover, the report will also contain signals of likely policy changes in the future along with a general evaluation of the factors influencing inflation and an in-depth discussion of general macroeconomic developments. Along with the Inflation Report, summaries of the Committee meetings will also be an important tool of communication policy. Distinguished guests, As final words, I would like to mention that the inflation targeting regime is not an end in terms of monetary policy, but on the contrary, a component of an uninterrupted “evolution” process. So far, we have tried to strengthen the economy with the help of fiscal discipline and ongoing structural reforms. I believe the independence of the Central Bank and the enhanced transparency and accountability will be the main tools to cope with challenges as they were in the previous period. I want to conclude by repeating my warm welcome to you all. I hope that you enjoy both the conference and your stay in Istanbul.  Thank you very much. BIS Review 19/2006 5 
Krzysztof Rybinski: Globalisation - opportunities, threats and implications for the economic policy Speech by Mr Krzysztof Rybinski, Deputy President of the National Bank of Poland, at a meeting with entrepreneurs who have participated in the economic climate survey carried out by the National Bank of Poland, Rzeszow, 10 March 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the meeting in the regional branch of the National Bank of Poland in Rzeszow. First of all, I would like to thank very much the management of the branch for their efforts to organise this meeting. Since 1998 the National Bank of Poland has carried out quarterly and annual economic climate surveys of enterprises. Results of this survey allow a better assessment of the state of the economy and the outlook for inflation. They also constitute a vital element of the economic analyses carried out by the NBP. Therefore, I would like to thank all of you for your contribution to the accumulation of knowledge at the NBP about the current processes in the Polish economy. Such knowledge, gained from people who create jobs, make investments and face domestic and foreign competition on a daily basis, is particularly important in the environment of the changing structure of the economy. Structural changes may bias results derived from econometric models used by central banks. Still as a student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at the Warsaw University, back in the late 1980s, I assisted in the works on a model of the Polish economy carried out at the Faculty of Economic Sciences. Soon afterwards, as a result of the fundamental changes in the structure of the Polish economy, consisting in liberalisation of prices and opening to foreign trade, the model became useless as a tool of macroeconomic analysis. Nowadays, the changes observed in the Polish economy are neither so rapid nor radical any more. However, intensification of changes in the global economy, reported in the recent years, must have brought in many economic relations other than those known so far. There have been many structural changes whose force, permanence and significance cannot be assessed on an ongoing basis with the use of econometric models. In principle, such an assessment is feasible only after a few years, which - from the point of view of pursuing an effective monetary policy - is too long a period1. This is why in such periods the so-called soft data and information, obtained directly from entrepreneurs, gain particular significance. There are numerous examples of such changes taking place in many countries. In spite of the fact that the interest rates of many central banks have been reduced to their historical lows in the recent years (they have been brought down to zero in Japan and were at the level of 1% in the USA for some time), and in spite of a high growth in prices of oil and other commodities, inflation in the largest world economies still remains low. The Federal Reserve Bank increased its interest rate from 1% to 4.5% over the past two years and the markets expect further rises, to the level of about 5.0%, whereas the interest rate on 10-year US Treasury bonds has been fluctuating at around 4.5% for a few years now. This phenomenon has even received an official name of “the Greenspan’s puzzle”. The yield curve in the US is inverted, which means that the interest rate on 2-year bonds is higher than that on 10-year bonds; in the light of the present knowledge, this should indicate an oncoming recession. Meanwhile, according to the present forecasts, the economic growth rate in the USA will slow down only slightly in 2006 and will remain close to the potential GDP. In 2005, the current account deficit in relation to the GDP in the USA exceeded 6%, and many forecasting institutions expect its further deterioration. Meanwhile, contrary to what the theory of economics says, the dollar exchange rate, instead of falling, appreciated against the euro by 13% in 2005. Although the US foreign liabilities exceed the assets by over USD 2.5 trillion, the current account income balance of the US in 2005 was positive. This has led                                                       1  As presented by A. Blinder and R. Reis in „Understanding the Greenspan Standard”, presented at the Fed conference in Kansas City in August 2005. (Economic Performance in the Greenspan Era: The Evolution of Events and Ideas). An example of such delays in the possibility of recognising a certain phenomenon is the rapid acceleration of the growth trend in labour productivity in the USA in mid-90s. The former Federal Reserve President Alan Greenspan formulated a thesis that such an acceleration took place in 1995, whereas econometric models where capable to show it only after five years from its occurrence. BIS Review 19/2006 1 
to creation of a new hypothesis, according to which the USA exports “dark matter”2. It claims that, since the US revenues on foreign assets are higher than the costs of servicing of foreign liabilities, some “other assets” must exist which, being measured incorrectly in the statistics, affect the “real” international investment position of the USA, which is not negative. In such a case, the US current account deficits observed in the recent years would be a statistical illusion. The aforementioned concept has stirred a very lively debate and has been forcefully criticised by many economists, including Willem Buiter3, a former EBRD chief economist. Another puzzle, described by the Federal Reserve economist Kevin Lansing4, is the fact that the growing share of the US society is aging and will leave the period of their highest income level behind. In such a situation, the Americans should be paying off their housing loans and accumulate savings. However, they do exactly the opposite thing. If this behaviour pattern does not change soon, many Americans may find themselves in a situation where retirement shall mean a radical decrease in their standard of living. Of course, it is difficult to point out a single factor that leads to all those changes. Yet, there is no doubt that one of the most important factors changing the structure of the global economy is the rapid globalisation of financial markets, trade, manufacturing and - in recent years - of services and knowledge. Globalisation has many dimensions but today I would like to focus on just two aspects that are actually interrelated, i.e. global imbalances and globalisation of manufacturing, services and knowledge, which takes on the form of offshoring. At the same time, I shall omit many other globalisation-related themes, such as globalisation of financial markets or migration. As I have mentioned before, one of the manifestations of globalisation in recent years are global imbalances. In 2005, the US current account deficit exceeded 5% of the GDP, and many forecasts of investment banks point to its further increase in 2006 and 20075. The USA has had a negative current account balance for two decades now. However, the growing rate of the deficit has accelerated in the recent years, which has brought the negative net investment position of the largest economy in the world down to the vicinity of 30% of the GDP in 2005 and - according to all available forecasts - will continue to deteriorate it rapidly. The large US current account deficit is related to a negative balance of household savings and a sharp increase in real property prices, observed not only in the USA but in all Anglo-Saxon countries6 in the recent years. Moreover, the US current account deficit is financed to a large extent from purchases of American debt securities by Asian central banks and - in the years 2004 and 2005 - to a growing increasing extent by public institutions managing foreign exchange reserves in oil-exporting countries. Foreign exchange reserves have increased substantially over the recent years. In China, for example, reserves of the People’s Bank of China increased from USD 166 billion in December 2000 to USD 819 billion in December 2005, and it is broadly expected that - in terms of size of its foreign exchange reserves - China will outdistance the to-date leader Japan, whose FX reserves reached USD 847 billion in December 2005, and that Chinese reserves will exceed USD 1 trillion in 20067. As yet, there is still no definition of global imbalances that would be commonly accepted by most of economists. In the economic literature of recent years most of the references to the problem of global imbalances concern the phenomena described above. Therefore, for the purposes of this speech, I shall assume that whenever global imbalances are mentioned, the term will mean a joint occurrence of the following factors:                                                       2  Ricardo Husmann, Federico Sturzenegger “Global imbalances or bad accounting? The missing dark matter in the wealth of nations”, Harvard University working paper, January 2006. 3  W. Buiter “Dark Matter or Cold Fusion”, Goldman Sachs Global Economics Paper, January 2006. 4  K.Lansing “Spendthrift Nation”, Federal Reserve Bank San Francisco Economic Letter, November 2005. 5  According to World Economic Outlook published by the IMF in September 2005, the forecasted US current account deficit will amount to USD 759 billion in 2005 and will increase to USD 805 billion in 2006. Both values correspond to 6.1% of the forecasted GDP. Some forecasts by investments banks, however, indicate an increase in the forecasted current account deficit to 6.5% of the GDP in 2005 and to 7-8% of the GDP in 2006 and 2007. 6  An extensive discussion of the real property market can be found in A. Ahearne et al. „House Prices and Monetary Policy: A Cross Country Study”, Fed Board of Governors, International Finance Discussion Papers, September 2005. 7  If one considers the fact that China has already used USD 60 billion from their foreign exchange reserves in order to recapitalise two commercial banks, the People’s Bank of China has now the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world. 2 BIS Review 19/2006 
• The high current account deficit in the USA. • The negative household savings in the Anglo-Saxon countries, particularly in the USA. • Sharp increases in real estate prices in Anglo-Saxon countries, which in some cases have characteristics of speculative bubbles. • Strong accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by public sector institutions in the Asian and oil-exporting countries. A combination of the above-mentioned factors, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of the world economy, has triggered a lively economic debate concerning two issues. Firstly, attempts are being made to explain how these imbalances came into being. Secondly, both academic economists and strategists at investment banks are trying to assess the possible scenarios of further developments. Are global imbalances a normal phenomenon in the global economy and can they increase further without any harm to the outlook for a long-term global growth? Can a radical adjustment of these imbalances occur - and if yes, what will be the mechanism of such an adjustment and what will its consequences for the global growth be? Let us begin with a presentation of the main hypotheses that explain the phenomenon of global imbalances. In 2003, three economists presented a hypothesis that an informal Bretton Woods regime had been reactivated8. The original Bretton Woods system was created after WWII and consisted in a formal obligation of its participant countries to maintain foreign exchange rates, determined against a gold parity, on a specific level, with acceptable deviations not exceeding 1 percent. The system ceased to exist in 1971 after president Nixon had taken a decision that the USA would no longer exchange dollars for gold according to the parity determined. The nature of the reactivated Bretton Woods, often called Bretton Woods 2, is well conveyed in the motto used by the authors of this concept: “(…) if I made an agreement with my tailor that whatever money I pay them, it returns to me on the very same day as a loan, I would have no objection at all to ordering more suits from him”  (Jacques Rueff, 1965, after Dooley et al. (2003)) The hypothesis of the existence of an informal Breton Woods 2 says that a system has been established in which it is profitable for the Asian countries to finance the US current account deficit, because it allows them to increase their exports to this market. Thus, it supports the economic development of the Asian countries and allows them to create new jobs, which is particularly important in China, where - according to various estimates - each year between 10 and 20 million of jobs should be created, due to migration from rural areas to cities. In order to maintain the competitiveness of their exports, the Asian countries intervene on the FX market, thus preventing appreciation of their currencies. They invest the purchased dollars in American bonds, thus financing the US current account deficit. Another hypothesis that explains the mechanism of the occurrence of global imbalances has been formed by the present Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke9. His major concept is that the large US current account deficit cannot be explained solely by internal factors. In the opinion of the present Fed chairman, external factors, which he has defined as a global savings glut, have played the key role. The hypothesis says that a substantial surplus of savings over investments in the Asian countries, together with the structurally high savings in Germany and Japan, have resulted in a global savings glut that has caused a boom on the US stock exchanges and an increase in the property prices, which has in turn resulted in a drop in household savings in the USA. The Bretton Woods 2 and the global savings glut hypotheses are challenged by the IMF, which claims that the source of the current account surpluses is the excessively low level of investments in the Asian countries - except for China. Thus, according to the IMF, we deal with a global investment drought10, considering the fact that during the five years following the Asian crisis of 1997-1998, the                                                       8  A series of articles on the topic was commenced with the work of M.Dooley, D.Folkerts-Landau and P.Garber „An Essay on the Revived Bretton Woods System“, NBER Working Paper 9971, September 2003. 9  A hypothesis of a global savings glut was formed for the first time by Ben Bernanke in March 2005 in his speech at a meeting of Virginia economists’ association. 10  For example in speeches by the IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato and the IMF Research Department Director Raghuram Rajan in January and February of 2006. BIS Review 19/2006 3 
level of investments was about 7 percentage points lower than during five years before the crisis. Therefore, an appropriate recommendation for these countries is not limiting their savings rate but enhancing their investment climate. According to other hypotheses, the major factor behind the global imbalances is the low level of savings in the US household and public sectors11, i.e. the fact that Americans spend more than they earn and that the budget deficit, from a substantial surplus in the year 2000, turned into a level estimated at 4.7% of the GDP in 2004. Another factor that is often indicated is the change in the economic policy of the Asian countries after the crisis of 1997-1998, when a decision was taken in many countries to establish huge foreign exchange reserves for the purpose of hedging against similar changes in the sentiment of financial markets in the future12. Other hypotheses indicate higher investment attractiveness of the USA in comparison to other regions, measured - inter alia - with the higher potential economic growth rate13. There exists another hypothesis, according to which such a high current account deficit is optimal14, in the face of the expected higher future growth rate of the American economy in comparison to that of other developed economies. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that Americans increase their present consumption financed from loans, anticipating high future earnings that will allow them to pay off the loans, which is perfectly correct. Finally, there are papers which try to prove that ... there is no deficit. The above-mentioned article by Hausmann and Sturzenegger15 arguing for the existence of “dark matter” is an example of this approach. In spite of many attempts to prove that the US current account deficit is in fact lower than it is believed to be and that it is even desirable, a vast majority of academic economists and many central bankers are seriously alarmed by the scale of global imbalances. Many papers have been written recently that show what may be the consequences of the scenario in which the financial markets - in view of no adequate measures undertaken by economic decision-makers - initiate adjustment processes by themselves16. If the financial markets start pricing in higher risk premium for American debt securities, the outflow of capital from this market - or even decreased capital inflows - may lead to a fall in bond prices, i.e. to a sharp increase in long-term interest rates, a slowdown on the property market, depreciation of the dollar and, consequently, stagnation or even recession, which may be observed globally. In order to mitigate the probability of such a scenario, structural reforms should be implemented in many countries. The USA should substantially reduce its budget deficit and - via a reform of the pension system - increase the household savings rate. In the EU and Japan a series of structural reforms should be accelerated to raise the flexibility and competitiveness of the labour and product markets . In the Asian countries, and first of all in China, the exchange rate regime needs to be made more flexible, which should be preceded by reforms that would strengthen the financial system, also via a greater openness to foreign capital inflows. At present, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of the scenario involving a serious slowdown in the global growth; nevertheless, implementation of necessary reforms is proceeding slowly. Before I move on to the other aspect of globalisation, let me repeat that I understand globalisation as a progressive process of international integration of national markets of goods, services, capital and knowledge. In practice, this means higher levels of trade and higher inflows of foreign investment,                                                       11  For example M. Chinn “Getting Serious about Twin Deficits”, working paper, The Bernard and Irene Schwartz Series on the Future of American Competitiveness, CSR No. 10, September 2005. 12  This hypothesis has been proved in: J.Aizenman, J.Lee “International Reserves: Precautionary vs. Mercantilist Views, Theory and Evidence”, IMF Working Paper WP/05/198, October 2005; and M-A Gosselin, N Parent “An Empirical Analysis of Foreign Exchange Reserves in Emerging Asia”, Bank of Canada working paper 2005-38, December 2005. 13  See R.Caballero et al. “An Equilibrium Model of Global Imbalances and Low Interest Rates”, MIT mimeo, September 2005. 14  C.Engel, J.Rogers “The U.S. Current Account Deficit and the Expected Share of World Output”, NBER working paper 11921, January 2006. 15  See footnote no. 2. 16  Examples of such estimations can be found in: S.Edwards “Is the U.S. Current Account Deficit Sustainable?

thanks to the intensified scale of those phenomena and thanks to including an increasing number of countries into the international economic processes. Taking into consideration the labour market, it may be observed that the inclusion of the CEE countries as well as the former Soviet Union countries, India, China, and other developing countries resulted in an increase in the global labour supply of 2 billion workers. Thus, we are witnesses to the establishment of the global labour market. Actions of international corporations undertaken to relocate manufacturing or orders to countries with lower manufacturing costs simply make use of the existing comparative advantages. The foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow between 1990 and 2004 increased more than threefold, amounting to ca. USD 648 billion in 2004. In the same period, the FDI inflow to developing countries was six times higher and in 2004 it amounted to USD 233 billion17. A significant factor contributing to intensification of the above phenomena is trade liberalisation, which involves reduction or elimination of customs tariff rates and all other non-tariff barriers that increase the costs of trade. Studies undertaken so far18 point to a significant role of preferential trade agreements, which in the years 1993-1997 involved about 70% of all trade exchange of West European countries. Apart from preferential trade agreements, a factor of vital importance to the liberalisation of global flows of goods are multilateral agreements within the WTO/GATT forum. Thanks to GATT agreements, there has been a sharp reduction in customs tariff rates from ca. 40% after WWII to 6% in the early 1990s and to 4% at the turn of the century19. A gradual reduction of barriers to trade is a slow process; however, it brings permanent benefits to each of the interested parties, as it leads to specialisation in production, which brings notable benefits in the form of maintaining a competitive position on the global market. Proofs of growing links among economies can be found e.g. in the world trade statistics, according to which exports of goods and services have increased fivefold since 198020. In 2005, the value of global exports corresponded to 29% of the global GDP, compared to 20% in 1980. This also indicates that trade develops at a much higher rate than the global domestic manufacturing. In the new EU Member States the export-to-GDP ratio has increased by 15 percentage points only over the past 10 years21. Changes in the growth rate have been accompanied by changes in the structure of exports, which have been significantly influenced by the foreign direct investment. Specialisation of production, as a prerequisite for competitiveness, leads companies to seek adequate locations allowing them to gain a competitive edge over rival companies. An increase in capital flows in the form of foreign direct investments (and especially the establishment of branches of multinational corporations) and international trade liberalisation favour fragmentation of the production process, consisting in its division into parts located in different countries. Fragmentation of production is also enabled by enhanced transport and information transfer as well as their lower costs (i.e. the decrease in transaction costs). The fragmentation of production is grounded in international differences in the endowments of factors of production and - as a result - in prices of these factors. Multinational corporations divide their production among many different countries in order to minimise costs and make use of advantages of local markets, such as inexpensive labour force or a favourable location. Research and development, on the other hand, and the part of the production process that requires the use of the most advanced technologies and with the highest value added, are often located in the home country, also due to poor protection of the proprietary rights in developing countries. Such a conduct allows the company to benefit from comparative advantages related to different production locations. Moreover, it enables the use of international differences in exchange rates, interest rates, and government subsidies supporting selected types of economic activity, as well as of different structures of customs tariff rates and varying features of internal markets in particular countries, for the purpose of maximising profits.

indicates that differences in remuneration constitute a significant factor that leads to relocation of jobs in manufacturing to the countries in our region. Hence, the result of production fragmentation is the optimal use of the advantage of location of particular production stages and the reduction of the average cost. However, its side effect are additional costs related to linking of the particular stages into one via activities that have the nature of services (e.g. transportation, co-ordination and management). The phenomena inseparable from all those mentioned above are offshoring and outsourcing. Offshoring consists in relocation of jobs and production or orders from the country where the company is based abroad – usually to countries with lower employment costs23. Offshoring does not have to necessarily take place within a single enterprise. Outsourcing, on the other hand, consists in relocation of a part of services outside the company. OECD calculations have shown that ca. 19% of jobs in EU-15 have been threatened by offshoring24. It should be noted, however, that for the developed countries this process does not mean losses of jobs. Mankiw and Swagel25 cite research results, according to which relocation of jobs abroad may be positively linked to an increase in employment in the home country of the relocating company. It stems from the fact that foreign branches do not compete but rather complement the hitherto activity of companies, and thus help to improve effectiveness and quality, and lower costs, which may lead to an increased market for products or services of the given company, what may in turn result in an increase in employment in the home country. It is first of all the countries capable of manufacturing products and rendering services at a competitive price that gain a major advantage in acquiring new investments and creating new jobs. It is worth adding that the growing significance of offshoring has an impact on the distribution of remuneration in the countries, whose participation in the globalisation process is increasing. The wages of unqualified workers from the developed countries are falling, while workers with higher qualifications from countries with lower labour costs are being better rewarded. Labour costs remain an important, although not a sole, factor of investment attractiveness of a given country. In A.T. Kearney’s research26 countries from our region, i.e. the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary, are in the top eleven offshoring locations. The assessments emphasised the cultural similarity of the countries in our region to the west European countries, relatively low barriers to business activity for West European companies as well as high qualifications of our employees. While comparing the abovementioned countries it has been indicated that the grade for Poland is slightly lower than for the Czech Republic as regards the infrastructure and respect for intellectual property rights. Offshoring in its broader scope constitutes a new idea of innovation in enterprise management27. While as a result of production relocation the company may lower its costs substantially, a much more important advantage of offshoring is that it may become an incentive to change production processes. In extreme cases this may lead to a situation where a company divests itself of all processes that have no direct connection with production or services rendered.                                                       23  However, relocation of manufacturing to countries with lower labour costs need not to be a rule. Research by Aubert and Sillar (2005) indicated that between 1995 and 2001 in France less than a half of all relocated jobs (on the offshore basis) in manufacturing were moved to countries with low production costs. According to the authors, such results rather to a motive of enterprise restructuring, whereas the phenomenon of offshoring is limited primarily to large enterprises employing over 500 persons. See P. Aubert and P . Sillar , „Offshoring and Job Losses in French Industry”, April 2005, OECD working paper. 24  OECD, “Growth in Services.

Alan Blinder28 goes even further and openly speaks about the third industrial revolution. He presents a vision of medical services which may performed on a remote basis (an example of radiological examinations in India) as well as rendering many educational services via electronic ways of communication. Formerly, the natural resources of an economy were of prior importance; nowadays, the perspectives of an economy depend to a greater degree on the human factor. This factor is decisive, especially in new branches of the economy, related to the services sector. Thanks to the development of new information and communication technologies, there has been an increase in trade in services, which - until recently - have been considered nontradable. The importance of the services sector in the economy should be stressed, as this sector constitutes a 70-percent share of the GDP in the developed economies. The whole accounting departments or customer support call centres outsourced are only some of the services that take advantage of new technologies. Some of those innovations have already become a permanent element of our reality: the possibility to purchase an airline ticket via the Internet, creation of inventory control systems in IT companies, a possibility to gather and process information on consumer behaviour. The aforementioned solutions embody the new forms of labour organisation and the development of new products and services, which are becoming increasingly common.  Research by van Ark29 indicates that the results of a comparison of the growth in labour productivity in the services sector in the USA and the EU-15 in the past 10 years are in favour of the USA. The advantage of the USA has resulted primarily from a higher labour productivity in retail and wholesale trade and in the financial services. Among the causes for the lower increase in labour productivity in the EU countries one should mention lower innovative capabilities of the European companies and a lack of reforms that could have forced the sector to take advantage of its potential. There are still regulation barriers to business activity in Europe, which make it impossible to move freely across country borders30. New information transfer technologies create a possibility of central processing of information, which is why limiting of the capability to take advantage of this process results in lower economies of scale. Moreover, the development of road transport still faces regulatory barriers. Finally, cultural differences, which are a natural barrier in business activity, should be mentioned. While indicating the vital role of services in building a competitive edge of the American economy, we should also relate to EU solutions in the form of the so-called Services Directive, which has been recently adopted by the European Parliament. The basic objective of the directive, in its version proposed by the European Commission, is to create a single market for services covering the whole of the European Union and to abolish all the barriers that prevent or significantly hinder rendering services by entrepreneurs of a given country in other EU countries. However, the amendments introduced by the Parliament, which deleted the so-called “country of origin” clause, in principle allow maintaining the existing barriers, which will result in a more difficult and hampered process of increasing the effectiveness of the European companies, including their capability of taking advantage of offshoring. This is why, in the era of globalisation, all initiatives that increase the region’s investment attractiveness play a vital role. The project of the City Council of Rzeszow, under which 60% of the city’s area will have a free access to the Internet, may serve as an example here. A parallel creation of a radio telephone network, allowing free calls between public institutions and the city inhabitants, make a step forward in the right direction.  On the other hand, the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy Ms. Danuta Hübner has emphasised how structural funds support development and innovation31: “Let me present an example of a project whose implementation was made possible thanks to the Structural Funds. Here in Poland, the administration uses the European Regional Development Fund in order to create a research lab for the aviation industry in the vicinity of Rzeszow. The goal of the project is to create a modern centre equipped with the state-of-the-art research infrastructure and                                                       28  A.

Public and private partners are involved in this undertaking — they formed a consortium composed of the Rzeszow University of Technology, other technical universities, a group of aviation industry enterprises called “The Aviation Valley” and the Polish Aviation Institute”. Globalisation influences the perspectives of the world’s major economies. In the USA, the discussion on relocation of jobs to the Asian countries became a lively element of political debate during the last presidential elections. Similarly, in Europe a debate is underway concerning the future of the single services market. There is no doubt, however, that any solutions of regulatory or protectionist nature may hinder all these changes only temporarily, as they are inevitable. The countries, whose politicians will understand the mechanisms of the global economy and will implement necessary reforms to improve the investment climate, will benefit the most from the globalisation processes. Entrepreneurs should also keep a sharp lookout on the globalisation processes currently underway, in order to respond to the emerging threats in a timely manner, but - first of all - in order to benefit from the great opportunities that they create.  Thank you very much for your attention. 8 BIS Review 19/2006 
Axel A Weber: The role of interest rates in theory and practice – how useful is the concept of the natural real rate of interest for monetary policy? Text of the G.L.S. Shackle Biennial Memorial Lecture 2006, by Mr Axel A Weber, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, at St. Edmund’s College, Cambridge, 9 March 2006. The references for the lecture can be found on the Deutsche Bundesbank’s website. *      *      * 1 Introduction It is obvious that interest rates play a key role in monetary policy today. On the one hand, the instrument of most central banks is a short-term interest rate. On the other, interest rates contain important information on the current state of the economy, and the extent to which past monetary policy measures have already started to take effect. Put it differently, interest rates are important as both an input into and an output of monetary policy decisions – they are instrument variables as well as indicator variables. Of course, there is no such thing as ‘the’ interest rate. Rather, there is a wide variety of them. Neglecting other relevant features, we have to distinguish interest rates at least with respect to their time to maturity and with respect to whether they are expressed in nominal or in real terms. Interest rates that matter for consumption and investment decisions are likely to be of longer maturity. Moreover, since economic agents ultimately benefit from the consumption of real goods, it will be real rates rather than nominal rates that they are mainly interested in. Monetary policy directly controls nominal and very short-term rates. However, since – according to the expectation theory of the term structure – longer-term rates depend on expected future short-term rates, a central bank does have the ability to affect them by influencing private agents’ expectations. A similar argument holds for real rates. Given the level of nominal rates, real interest rates depend on expected future inflation rates. To a large extent, these depend on the degree to which the public believes monetary policy will be able to ensure price stability. Besides expected short-term interest rates and expected inflation, longer-term real rates also depend on several types of risk premia, for example inflation risk. These constitute an additional channel through which monetary policy may influence long-term real rates. Thus, monetary policy exerts both a direct effect on short-term nominal rates and an indirect but important effect on long-term real rates.  Understanding how current economic variables – such as economic activity and policy variables – interact with expected future variables is a challenge that has been featuring prominently in both academic discussion and monetary policy practice in recent years. Accordingly, the book by Michael Woodford “Interest and Prices”, which is cited frequently nowadays, characterizes the practice of central banking mainly as the management of expectations. This is an aspect of which G.L.S. Shackle was already well aware, as we shall see later.  Having said that monetary policy does have an influence on a variety of interest rates it is not clear a priori whether certain levels of these rates are ‘adequate’ in the sense that they represent prudent monetary policy. This brings me to my second point, the information content of interest rates. Inferring the current monetary policy stance from prevailing interest rates requires some sort of benchmark. Ideally, this would be a reference level – depending on current economic conditions – with which some particular interest rate could be compared, the difference between the two then measuring how loose or tight monetary policy is. For such a benchmark to be useful for the monetary policy decision-making process, it should satisfy certain criteria, including the following three. • First, that benchmark rate should be based on sound theoretical foundations. This would allow a meaningful interpretation of its behaviour and the driving forces behind it.  • Second, the difference between some particular interest rate and this benchmark rate should ideally be a summary variable reflecting the overall pressure on inflation. If this is not possible, it should, at least, contain some predictive power for future inflation.  • Third, the benchmark should be readily computable from observable economic data. Ideally, this criterion includes the requirement that these data should be available with sufficient precision at the time they are needed.  BIS Review 18/2006 1 
Actually, there is an economic variable which is often claimed to provide such a benchmark role: the natural real rate of interest on which I will focus in this talk. I will start with Wicksell’s notion of the natural rate, followed by a presentation of its definition and role in today’s monetary macroeconomics. After that, I will focus on approaches to measuring the natural real rate of interest (NRI) and its usefulness for the practice of monetary policy. At the end of my remarks, I will try to judge whether the natural rate is able to satisfy all or some of the criteria I have listed. 2  Wicksell’s concept of the natural rate of interest The concept of a natural rate of interest goes back to Wicksell. He defined it as the level of the real interest rate at which prices have no tendency to move either upward or downward. The starting point of his analysis is the assumption that any movement in the price of a single good must have been caused by a mismatch between the demand for and the supply of this particular good. Accordingly, the movement of the aggregate price level must have been caused by a mismatch between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Wicksell therefore stressed that any theory which intends to explain the overall rate of inflation must therefore be able to explain the underlying aggregate demand and supply movements.  A second important aspect of Wicksell’s theory is related to the role of money and credit. He did not doubt that money growth is a necessary condition for inflation, but his approach is based on the endogeneity of money – in other words, money is not exogenous. Here, the banking system plays the crucial role: By extending credit to firms and households it determines the growth rate of money and thereby aggregate demand.  Key to the understanding of this connection is Wicksell’s ’cumulative process’. Banks setting ‘too low’ an interest rate trigger a high credit demand from investors because, given the relatively low interest rate costs, they have a high expected return. Owing to the prevailing very large degree of flexibility in the banking sector, banks can satisfy this higher loan demand, which results in an increase in money growth and a higher demand for investment goods. This tends to increase the price level of investment goods and the competitive wages in the investment goods sector, causing expenditures and the overall price level to rise. This is how Shackle describes the next steps in Wicksell’s cumulative process: “The cost of production per physical unit of goods will be rising month by month, but the price of goods per unit will be rising as fast, will be keeping ahead, and the persisting gap per unit will invite an ever-larger output”.1 The cumulative process of strong money creation by a highly flexible banking system and a higher aggregate price level does not end until the banks have raised the interest rate sufficiently. Here, ‘sufficiently’ means that the interest rate – which is set by the banks – should be raised to the level at which the overall demand for goods equals their supply – that is, the interest rate at which prices remain constant. Wicksell referred to this interest rate level as the ‘natural rate of interest’. Shackle was certainly right when in the foreword to the English translation by Stephen Frowen of Wicksell’s “Value, Capital and Rent” in 1953 he compared the contribution to economic theory made by Wicksell’s concept of a natural rate of interest to that made by the steam locomotive in the built-up of modern societies.2 But, with the benefit of hindsight, we now know that Shackle was a little too pessimistic when he predicted that the natural rate could become as obsolete as the steam locomotive. Modern monetary theory – as embodied in the latest generation of New-Keynesian macroeconomic models, for example – proves that the opposite is true. It is not by accident that Michael Woodford’s textbook – which became sort of a standard work in modern monetary theory – carries the title “Interest and Prices” - the English translation of the title of Wicksell’s book ’Geldzins und Güterpreise’. 3  The natural rate of interest in modern macroeconomic theory In order to highlight the key role of the natural interest rate concept in modern monetary theory, it is useful to recapitulate briefly the core structure of New-Keynesian models which form the workhorse of                                                       1  Shackle, (1972),p. 336. 2  Shackle (1954). 2 BIS Review 18/2006 
today’s monetary policy analysis.3 Basically, such models add various forms of nominal rigidities to the features of the real-business-cycle paradigm which is based on the notion of dynamically optimising agents in a world characterised by stochastic shocks. One of the key elements is the assumption of rational expectations: Agents fully take into account the specifics of the model world they inhabit and the consequences of today’s actions for the future. In particular, they bear in mind how the monetary authority is likely to react to macroeconomic developments, and this, in turn, influences their own actions in the here and now.  Models in this micro-based paradigm render it possible to analyse the outcomes of policy changes without running into the Lucas critique. Moreover, such models can highlight and quantify the ability of monetary policy to influence private sector expectations which are key to a proper understanding of the effects of monetary policy. Based on this view, as I mentioned before the practice of modern central banking has frequently been described as being, to a large extent, the management of private expectations. This is an aspect of monetary policy which was already stressed by Shackle in his 1949 article on “The nature of interest rates.” Describing a situation in which the central bank tries to bring interest rates down he states that [p. 115] “a consensus of market opinion can be swung, by words and deeds of the monetary authority or its masters”.  The structure of the basic New-Keynesian model can be easily represented by three equations characterising the dynamics of the interest rate, output and inflation. The first equation can be related to the supply side, the second to aggregate demand, and the third specifies monetary policy behaviour. The equation representing aggregate supply captures the price-setting behaviour of firms, resulting from profit-maximisation under the obstacle of some sort of nominal price rigidity. Owing to this rigidity, firms have to take into account the expected development of prices in the next period when setting their prices today. In its most basic form, this equation is known as the “New-Keynesian Phillips curve” which expresses current inflation πt as a function of currently expected inflation for the next period Et(πt+1) and the current output gap xt:4         πt = β·Et(πt+1) + κ· xt.     (1) The latter stands for the amount of slack in the goods market and is defined as the difference between actual output and its natural level, that is, the production level which would prevail in the hypothetical situation of fully flexible prices.  The demand equation (’IS curve‘) is based on the assumption that households optimise their whole consumption stream over the present and the future. This leads to an expression relating the current output gap to the currently expected output gap of the next period Et(xt+1) and an interest rate gap:               xt = Et(xt+1) – σ  -1 ·(it  - Et(πt+1) – rt*)    (2) The natural real rate of interest comes in at this stage: the interest rate gap is the difference between the actual ex ante real interest rate it  - Et(πt+1) and the natural real rate of interest rt*. This variable turns out to be a key variable for the design of monetary policy in this class of models. Within the New-Keynesian paradigm it is defined as the one-period equilibrium real rate of return that would prevail in the hypothetical equilibrium with completely flexible prices, that is, in the absence of nominal price rigidities. As is evident from the demand equation the situation where current and expected output is at its flexible-price level is accompanied by the actual real interest rate being equal to its natural counterpart and thus by a closed interest rate gap.  The natural rate of interest is influenced solely by real factors such as productivity growth, movements in government expenditure, the growth of the workforce, the tax structure, and the time preference of households. As a consequence, the natural rate is not constant over time but mirrors the dynamics of all those driving forces. Accordingly, it is subject to short- and long-run fluctuations.5 As for the absolute level of the natural real rate, one cannot state that a high or low level does per se represent a state of the economy which is desirable or not. It simply reflects its driving forces which themselves                                                       3  See Clarida, Gali Gertler (1999), Gali (2003) and Woodford (2003). 4  The parameter β denotes the subjective discount rate of private households, κ incorporates the degree of nominal price rigidity and σ (in equation (2)) governs households’ intertemporal elasticity of substitution.  5  An example of the dependency of the natural rate on structural changes has been pointed out by Charles Bean recently, see Bean (2004). He stresses that global demographic change would lead to a lower natural rate not only in the new steady state but also along the transition path. BIS Review 18/2006 3 
could, in principle, be gauged as being favourable or not. For instance, an increase in the natural rate may be induced by a rise in productivity growth but may also be rooted in the need to finance larger social security deficits.6For monetary policy purposes, the indicator quality of the natural rate for inflation is of special interest. To this end, what matters is the level of the actual real interest rate compared with the natural rate of interest. Again, this is illustrated most clearly within the baseline New-Keynesian model. An actual real interest rate below the natural level – that is, a negative interest rate gap – implies a positive value of the output gap which tends to increase inflation. If, for instance, an expected permanent future increase in productivity induces agents to expect higher income in the future, they will try to smooth consumption by already raising their consumption level in the present. In a flexible price equilibrium, the natural real interest rate would rise, increasing current desired savings in order to equate the current consumption level and current natural output again. However, if the actual real interest rate does not rise sufficiently, there will be a negative interest rate gap, which increases the current output gap – that is, stimulates the economy too much – which in turn leads to inflationary pressure.7Interestingly, in these models the current inflation rate can be expressed solely as a sum of current and expected future interest rate gaps. In this sense, the sequence of interest gaps is a sufficient statistic for the determinants of inflation. This is close to the story told by Wicksell. Indeed, it may be interpreted as a forward-looking variant of the Wicksellian analysis outlined above.8 However, at this point the New-Keynesian paradigm also differs from Wicksell’s theory in one crucial aspect: while Wicksell viewed inflation as being a disequilibrium phenomenon, inflation in the New-Keynesian model is an equilibrium phenomenon. In the latter case, all markets clear each period and all variables are consistent with the optimality conditions of forward-looking households and firms. 4  Monetary policy and the natural rate of interest in theory Since there is no trade-off between output and inflation stabilisation in the theoretical model presented so far, the prescription for stability-oriented monetary policy is straightforward: measure the currently prevailing natural real rate of interest, and equate the one-period interest rate – which is the monetary policy instrument – with that number. If an inflation rate different from zero is viewed as desirable, the resulting interest rate should simply be increased by that amount. For expositional clarity, I will assume a zero inflation objective in the following theoretical remarks.9  The key role which the natural rate plays with regard to the inflation process in the described basic New-Keynesian model thus renders monetary policy a simple task: Although there are a variety of real shocks that influence inflation, the central bank only has to care about the movements in the natural rate through which the shocks are channelled. However, in this benchmark New-Keynesian model, too, the described policy would have the problem that it is merely consistent with the equilibrium outcome of price stability but does not necessarily create it. The problem is that it permits the occurrence of other less desirable equilibria with fluctuating inflation and output gaps. This is why monetary policy must also commit to react sufficiently strongly to endogenous variables such as the deviations of the output gap and inflation from their target values. Thus – assuming a zero inflation objective – the monetary policy reaction function in this theoretical model would set the short-term interest rate as        it = rt* + g1· xt  + g2·πt,     (3) where rt* denotes the natural real rate of interest. If the monetary policy authority credibly commits to follow the natural rate and to react to unfavourable situations, these situations will never occur at all. Thus, following the above rule not only supports the equilibrium of full stabilisation but pins it down as the only possible one.  We should further note that a simple Taylor rule of the form                                                        6  See ECB (2004). 7  See Amato92005).  8   See Woodford (2003) p. 279. 9  For the analysis of monetary policy in the simple model with and without cost-push shocks, see Gali (2002). 4 BIS Review 18/2006 
       it = c + g1· xt  + g2 ·πt,     (4) which does not follow the variations in the natural rate of interest would generally not be able to generate full stabilisation. To illustrate this, assume for the moment that monetary policy can nevertheless commit to (4) and at the same time completely stabilize output and inflation. In this case, the nominal interest rate and expected inflation would be constant over time. However, since the natural real rate of interest moves due to exogenous factors, the resulting interest rate gap varies. But according to demand equation (2) this would be incompatible with the assumed complete stabilisation of the output gap. This line of reasoning shows that the simple policy rule (4) is not capable of implementing complete stabilisation unless the natural rate is constant. Unlike in the simple model considered so far, monetary policy will in general not be able to guarantee full stabilisation at all times. One important factor that generates a trade-off between output and inflation stabilisation is the presence of cost-push shocks. These appear as an additional disturbance term in the Phillips curve,              πt = β· Et(πt+1) + κ· xt + et.     (1a) Thus, a cost-push shock constitutes an additional driving force to inflation beyond those effects that operate via the output gap. The presence of such shocks can arise from time-varying market power of firms, from time-varying distortionary consumption or wage taxation, or from time-varying wage-mark-ups in imperfectly competitive labour markets.10 In contrast to the earlier example, where all inflationary pressures had been due to real shocks – manifested in movements of the natural rate – the central bank will now face a trade-off between output-gap and inflation stabilisation. If a cost push shock arises, the monetary authority may raise the interest rate to counterbalance the effect on inflation. This, however, now comes at the cost of generating a negative output gap. In this case, the weights that the central bank attaches to both targets come into play. In theory, this is typically represented by a loss function that increases in squared deviations of the output level and inflation from target.11The policymaker seeks to minimize this loss function, taking the functioning of the economy as a constraint. In the presence of cost-push shocks, it is immediately evident that – contrary to the model without cost-push shocks – a vanished interest rate gap does not imply price stability. What the optimal policy looks like in this case depends, in particular, on whether or not the policymaker can credibly commit to future actions or – in the language of the “time inconsistency” literature – whether monetary policy is conducted under discretion or commitment. In any case, given the existence of cost-push shocks, a policy that merely traces the path of the natural rate is not optimal. Rather, optimal policy will have to take into account both: movements in the natural rate and the nature of additional cost-push shocks which are not manifested in the natural rate.  5  Monetary policy and the natural rate of interest in practice In light of the discussed theoretical considerations, the natural rate of interest could in principle play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy. And at least conceptually its measurement would be straightforward: identify its real driving forces, get to know in what way the NRI is affected by each of them, and finally measure their values. Obviously, all of these three steps imply considerable obstacles. Step one requires an exhaustive enumeration of all those real factors that are potentially important. Step two requires a precise knowledge of how these factors affect the real rate, thus requiring some sort of a very exact economic model. Finally, step three requires a measurement of variables which are themselves partly unobservable, such as the time discounting rate of private households. Therefore, the natural rate has to be estimated indirectly based on current and past observations of directly observable economic data, making use of a more or less detailed model prescribing the interactions of the NRI with these variables.  However, policymakers intending to make use of the natural rate are in an even less comfortable position than econometricians conducting ex post analyses for estimating the NRI at a given point in                                                       10  See Benigno and Woodford (2004), Walsh (2003) or Woodford (2003). 11  More elaborated optimising models based on utility-maximising agents even allow choosing this loss function so that it represents the utility stream of private agents, which in turn makes meaningful welfare analyses of different policies possible.

history. Econometricians can use current, past, and future observations to make inferences about the NRI, while policymakers have only past and current data at their disposal. Moreover, past and current data may also be affected by data revisions, this so-called ‘real-time data problem’ being, in itself, a significant obstacle to monetary policy analysis on its own.  5.1 Estimating the natural rate of interest For estimating the NRI, a number of different methods have been established in the literature. Unfortunately, they lead to a wide range of different results.12 Such variability across estimation methods poses an additional problem besides the one of uncertainty surrounding any statistical estimate. As we shall see below, dealing with these uncertainties in an appropriate manner is a real challenge for monetary policy – a challenge which is both discussed in the current academic literature and debated in the context of policymaking in practice. The various approaches to estimating the NRI in the literature can be grouped into the following three categories: (1) univariate filtering approaches, (2) structural econometric models with the NRI as a latent variable, and (3) fully-fledged equilibrium models with microeconomic foundations. In my following remarks, I will sketch the nature of these methods and comment on their advantages and drawbacks. One approach to estimating the NRI is based on simply using realised real rates. The idea supporting this modus operandi, is that in the long run – that is, after all shocks have washed out – the actual real rate should have converged to its natural counterpart. If moving averages of actual real rates are taken over the typical length of a business cycle, the resulting number may be interpreted as being close to the natural rate. Since the method uses actual real rates it already inherits the arbitrariness of measuring them: one has to decide between ex ante and ex post measures of inflation and on the type of price index used. Additionally, one has to decide the window width over which the sequence of means is computed. Since all these choices will have an influence on the level of the estimated natural real rate, different variants of this approach can result in quite different point estimates of the NRI.  The NRIs resulting from such moving average estimations typically constitute a fairly smooth time series. However, this stands in contrast to the characterising features of the ‘true’ natural rate outlined above, because – theoretically - it can in fact exhibit strong variations corresponding to the size and dynamics of the real shocks it depends on. In general, methods based on averaging will by their very nature translate a de facto abrupt persistent upward change in the NRI into a smooth phase of transition. This drawback remains even if the averaging method is refined, as is the case, for example, in methods that filter out low-frequent components from the real rate.13Alternatively, the literature also employs econometric models which explicitly specify the dynamics of the natural rate as an exogenous stochastic process. This approach is – on the one hand – based on exogenous shocks and – on the other – on the assumption about certain structural relations between observable variables and the NRI.14 These structural equations may contain quite general formulations of inflation and output dynamics based on economic theory. Typically, they nest a variety of specifications from both specific theories and ad hoc assumptions. For instance, an inflation equation may nest a forward-looking Phillips curve that would result from particular assumptions of a micro-founded equilibrium model – as mentioned above – but would also contain lagged inflation and real activity in order to take account of some degree of backward-lookingness that is present in the data. Here, the key idea is that the NRI – which, by its very nature, is unobservable – may be filtered out from observable data on the basis of the model’s implications for the interaction between the NRI and these observable variables. This filtering technique is more efficient if it is two-sided, that is, if it uses not just past and current data, but also future data. However, since policymakers are confined to one-sided filtering, this real-time problem tends to reduce the usefulness of this method. The aforementioned econometric approaches specify a fairly general structure of the dynamics of key economic variables that interact with the NRI. Alternatively, one may use more specific general equilibrium models of the economy, which are usually based on explicit microeconomic foundations.                                                       12  See in particular the survey in Crespo Cuaresma, Gnan and Ritzberger-Grünwald (2005). 13 These problems are analogous to those encountered when estimating potential output. Filtering low-frequency components from a series of actual output does not in general lead to a time series that shares the characteristics of the theoretical concept of potential output.  14  See e.g., Laubach and Williams (2003) and Mesonnier and Renne (2004). 6 BIS Review 18/2006 
For the euro area, the model by Smets and Wouters (2003), for instance, has gained some popularity as a tool for monetary policy analysis. Such a model makes it possible to emulate the hypothetical flexible-price path of the economy, that is, the sequence of equilibria in which all real variables are at their natural levels. This counterfactual exercise allows us to derive the natural rate of interest. Usage of an estimated equilibrium model also makes it possible to track and interpret the very sources of its variation, such as shocks to technology, government spending, or a change in the tax system.15Moreover, structural equilibrium models direct attention to the role that specific key variables may play in identifying the relative natural rate movements. As outlined above, inflation may be represented by the sum of future expected natural real interest rates. But an immediate proxy for the expected natural real interest rate is even less available than it is for the current natural real rate. However, exploiting the logic of forward-looking models, these important future developments may be inferred from observations available in real time. For instance, in variants of the New-Keynesian model, presented in Andres, Lopez-Salido and Nelson (2004), portfolio adjustment costs lead to a forward-looking specification of money demand. This, in turn, implies that current real balances are linked not only to current income and interest rates but also to the sum of expected future values of the NRI and interest rate gaps. In other words, if their model is true, money contains valuable information on future natural real rates. For policymakers, this a crucial point: Given the real-time data problems with which they are confronted, looking at monetary developments may be useful for learning about the current (and future) state of the economy even in the New-Keynesian world which, at first sight, has no such role for money to offer. And this point is to some extent also related to Wicksell’s theory, where an interest rate gap has direct implications for credit and money growth. I will come back later to the issue of monetary indicators’ usefulness.  However, deriving the natural rate of interest from structural models is accompanied by the risk that the underlying narrow view of economic interactions may not be an adequate representation of reality. Basing estimates of the NRI on a distorted picture of real-world interactions would then lead to a distorted estimate of the NRI. Obviously, this shows that the use of the concept of the natural rate of interest for policymaking comes with the problems of model and data uncertainty.  5.2 Monetary policy guided by estimates of the natural rate of interest From the foregoing remarks it should come as no surprise that point estimates of the natural rate of interest vary immensely across methods. Again, it is important to note that this variation across estimation approaches prevails in addition to the statistical uncertainty surrounding every point estimate for any given model on which it is based. For the euro area since 1999, a synopsis in a paper by Crespo Cuaresma, Gnan, and Ritzberger-Grünwald (2005) shows that estimated paths of the NRI differ considerably in terms of their levels, the range that they cover over time, and their smoothness. Therefore, the natural question arises as to whether the concept of the NRI can be useful to monetary policymakers in practice. For illustration, let us consider again the most basic New-Keynesian model without any output/inflation trade-offs. Here, policymakers can completely stabilise the path of inflation and output: they set the nominal interest rate equal to the natural real rate of interest plus their inflation objective. They commit to react to inflation and output gap fluctuations, but these would never occur in equilibrium. However, if the natural rate is not measured precisely and is simply replaced by its estimate in the above rule, then “estimation error becomes policy error, and stabilization policy becomes destabilizing”.16One therefore has to explore what the optimal monetary policy looks like in the presence of measurement uncertainties concerning the natural rate. This is one instance of the general question of how monetary policy should act in presence of uncertainty about the state of the economy and this issue currently constitutes a very active research area. Under specific assumptions the apparently comfortable principle of ‘certainty equivalence’ prevails: optimal policy should react to its best estimate of a state variable in exactly the same way as it should react if this variable were precisely observable. It is immediately clear that even in this ‘straightforward’ case, every policy that comes in the form of a ‘simple rule’ loses that property of simplicity: reacting to the ‘best estimate’ of any state variable                                                       15  See also Neiss and Nelson (2001). In their DSGE model, it is particularly interesting to see that the response of the NRI to a technology shock depends crucially on the specification of capital adjustment.  16  Jonathan A. Parker in a comment on Orphanides and Williams (2002). BIS Review 18/2006 7 
usually implies conducting a one-sided filtering exercise, yielding a state estimate which is a function of all current and past observables. Moreover, this approach is conditional on two crucial requirements: first, the central banker has to know the structure of the data-generating process for the NRI in order to come up with the best estimate. And second, this best estimate will typically depend on the degree of mismeasurement of the NRI which, in general, is not precisely known either. Thus, in trying to react appropriately to state uncertainty, uncertainty kicks in on another level, posing an even greater challenge.  If model uncertainty or uncertainty about the degree of mismeasurement prevails, policymakers are well advised to go for a strategy that is robust to misconceptions of the true economic mechanism or the degree of NRI mismeasurement. That is, a policy that performs acceptably under a variety of possible model structures should be preferred to one that is optimal in one specific environment but would lead to disastrous outcomes if another setting prevailed. One way to tackle this issue is the Bayesian approach, where the policymaker has to assign a subjective probability distribution over the class of possible models prevailing.17 Of course, doing so requires an a priori decision about the set of models considered within the exercise. Note that this problem is closely related to G.L.S Shackle’s work on uncertainty: coming up with a sensible set of models – relevant for decisions affecting the future – may not be accomplishable: there are always „fresh kaleidic shift(s) of the environment“18, thus, those models that are potentially adequate to describe the economic characteristics of the future may not be imaginable today.  Model uncertainty in the sense of an unknown degree of mismeasurement of the natural rate19 is the subject of Orphanides and Williams (2002): they show that the welfare cost of underestimating the degree of mismeasurement of the natural rate of interest20 exceeds the cost of overestimating it. Put differently, a policy that is optimal for the case of low measurement uncertainty would induce large welfare losses if measurement uncertainty is, in fact, high, but would bring about only moderate losses in efficiency in the converse case. Accordingly, the robust policy rule puts little weight on the estimate of the natural rate. In the extreme, robust optimal policy would ignore it completely and go for a policy rule that relies on first differences of observed variables rather than the relevant gaps.21  6 Summing up and looking ahead This example illustrates that on top of all those statistical measurement problems the question of how to react optimally to an estimate of the natural rate may be an even more intricate problem. So at the end of the day, what can we make of the concept of the natural real rate of interest for the practice of monetary policy? To answer this question, let me come back to the properties for an ideal benchmark indicator of the monetary policy stance, which I listed at the beginning.  First, concerning theoretical foundations, the natural real rate of interest – with an already long tradition in economic theory – plays a key role in modern rational-expectations models of monetary macroeconomics and stands on sound analytical ground. It is a tool for thinking about the monetary transmission process. This is because the determinants of the natural rate of interest – for example changes in preferences, advances in production technology and variations in government spending – all have an effect on output fluctuations and inflation. Thus, the natural rate of interest subsumes all these real shocks into a single number that – when compared with the actual real rate – provides an indicator for the stance of monetary policy.  Second, even within the limits of the theoretical framework, the corresponding interest rate gap is not a sufficient summary variable reflecting the overall pressure on inflation in the sense that it captures all                                                       17  See Angeloni, Smets and Weber (1999) and the references therein concerning the problem of monetary policy making under uncertainty with special reference to ECB policy.  18  Shackle (1972), p. 240. 19  Thus, compared to the latter considerations, model uncertainty in a quite narrow sense. 20  They are concerned with both the natural rate of interest and the natural rate of unemployment.  21  Orphanides and Williams even propose a policy rule that completely dismisses any reliance on natural rate concepts. See, however, the comment by J. A. Parker who claims that within non-simple rules estimates of the natural rates can be fruitfully exploited.  8 BIS Review 18/2006 
possible determinants of price changes. Rather, cost-push shocks provide a source of inflation which is important for monetary policymakers to know, but which is not mirrored by the natural rate of interest.  Third, the natural rate of interest is not readily computable from observable economic data. On the contrary, its measurement is affected by severe problems. In addition to the usual statistical estimation uncertainty, estimated NRIs differ widely across estimation approaches. The more simplistic the approach one follows, the farther away one will move from a theoretically founded notion of the NRI. This problem is less severe if a detailed theoretical model is used for estimation. In this case, however, the problem of model uncertainty becomes pivotal. Thus, I think one can safely conclude that the natural rate cannot be a surrogate for a detailed analysis of the real and monetary forces relevant for the identification of risks to price stability. As we have seen, even within the simple New-Keynesian model with cost-push shocks, the natural real rate of interest or the corresponding real interest rate gap alone is not a sufficient measure of the monetary policy stance.  Moreover, it is far from certain what role the natural rate may play in models outside the New-Keynesian paradigm. This point is particularly relevant with respect to models that aim to capture the longer-run perspective between monetary developments and inflation. Such models could represent natural complements to models of short-run fluctuations – such as those of the New-Keynesian type – in the toolbox of policymakers. These are an essential device for judging the medium to long-term risks to price stability. More generally, an anchoring of inflation expectations in the long run requires that any analysis of the real side – in which natural rate considerations take place – is complemented by an analysis of monetary and credit development. This is one line of reasoning that stands behind the two-pillar strategy of the Eurosystem, which takes account of short to medium run inflationary pressures within its economic analysis as well as of medium to long-run risks to price stability within its monetary analysis. However, I think further active research on the role of the natural rate for monetary policy and its measurement is certainly worthwhile. Theoretical considerations along the lines of Wicksell’s cumulative process or of the New-Keynesian paradigm have demonstrated that the natural rate may be key to understanding the factors that drive inflation. And since policymakers cannot afford to discard such information, they should certainly keep an eye on it. However, one cannot judge the usefulness of the natural rate of interest for monetary policy purposes without taking into account the serious problems that accompany its measurement and estimation. As has been pointed out, these problems are severe and comprise a considerable degree of data as well as model uncertainty. Seen from this perspective, it may be worthwhile to examine in more detail what information content the real-time estimates of the natural rate of interest from various empirical approaches – or more precisely the implied real interest rate gaps – have for future inflation. This exercise would move away a bit from the question of what measure provides an estimate that is as close as possible to the ‘true’ natural rate, and would move towards the question of which is the most informative empirical measure based on natural rate considerations for inflation in the medium run.22 Finally, within the very active theoretical literature on optimal monetary policy under uncertainty, there remains the relevant question of what to do with the – up to now very imprecise – estimates of the natural rate of interest.  Conclusion Coming back to the title of this lecture “The role of interest rates in theory and practice - How useful is the concept of the natural real rate of interest for monetary policy?” I would like to conclude by answering this question. I think that the concept of the natural rate of interest is of importance for modern monetary theory and that it is proving to be very useful in organising one’s thoughts about the working of the economy and the effects of monetary policy. Thinking again of Shackle’s likening of Wicksell’s natural rate of interest to the steam locomotive I would say that the modern theoretical version of this concept is indeed a high-speed train. However, the degree to which this theoretical concept can be transferred to the sphere of practical monetary policy is, as yet, uncertain.                                                       22  Neiss and Nelson (2001) find that a real interest rate gap based on an estimated DSGE model has explanatory power for future inflation in the UK.

Roger W Ferguson, Jr: International financial reporting and auditing Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, to the Financial Stability Forum, International Accounting Standards Board, and International Federation of Accountants Roundtable on Financial Reporting and Auditing, Paris,        16 February 2006 (via videoconference). *      *      * It is a pleasure to join you for this joint Roundtable on Financial Reporting and Auditing. As chairman of the Financial Stability Forum, I would like to express my appreciation to all of you that are participating in this roundtable as distinguished speakers or in other roles. In addition, I appreciate the very good partnership that we have had with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with our host, the World Bank, in preparing for this gathering.  Since our last joint Roundtable in October 2004, much has transpired in the international accounting and auditing arenas. Indeed, 2005 was a very big implementation year for international standards around the world. The topics of this Roundtable--dealing with the experience of implementing IASB and IFAC standards and related regulatory challenges, international convergence and harmonization, issues associated with using fair values in the financial reporting model, and risks and vulnerabilities arising from the financial reporting chain--all reflect the interconnectedness of accounting, auditing, and regulation and the need to consider these issues from the unique perspectives that all of you bring to the table. It is very important that this type of constructive dialogue continues to take place among the many key stakeholders in the financial reporting chain. The focus of the roundtable--international financial reporting and auditing--continues to gain increased attention from members of the international regulatory community such as the Financial Stability Forum, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), and the Basel Committee as well as from national supervisors, standards setters, banks, investors, analysts, auditors, and many others. As we all know, in recent years, accounting and auditing scandals and other developments have found their way onto the front pages of your daily newspapers in ways rarely seen before. These challenging developments have led to a new resolve on the part of governmental, regulatory, and business leaders that there must be a reinforcement and improvement of standards-setting processes and a return to sound accounting, auditing, and disclosure practices by companies and their auditors.  The unprecedented problems of a few years ago fueled efforts to help restore investor confidence in U.S. and European capital markets through legislative reforms affecting both the accounting profession and corporate management and directors. For example, these efforts led to, for example, the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States which set the stage for a new audit oversight authority--the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board--to regulate, inspect, report on, and in some cases enforce penalties against auditors and led to new requirements for corporate management to maintain strong internal controls and to make periodic public reports on the adequacy of their companies' internal controls. In the European Union, the Eighth Directive and other initiatives were undertaken in recognition of the important role of audit oversight authorities. These initiatives seek to strengthen accounting standards, internal controls, and transparency. But long before these legislative initiatives were being considered, steps were taken to establish independent international standards-setting frameworks for both accounting and auditing standards, as reflected by the creation of the IASB in 2001 and the IFAC International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (or IAASB). Both of these standards-setting processes have been reviewed and enhanced over time and continue to be subject to improvements. In his keynote speech earlier today, Michel Prada shared with you IOSCO's initiatives to address international accounting and auditing issues. It is clear that IOSCO has played a very important role in these arenas for many years. Likewise, central banks and banking supervisors have taken steps to enhance their focus on accounting and auditing matters that affect institutions they supervise. During the mid-1990s, the Basel Committee started to devote more resources to developing principles that would help shape and improve bank disclosure, supervisory reporting, and accounting practices. Moreover, the committee recognized that it was also important to support high-quality standards-setting processes. With the formation of the Accounting Task Force by the Basel Committee in 1997, BIS Review 18/2006 1 
the Basel Committee began to participate more actively in processes for setting accounting and auditing standards. This participation led to the development of enhanced accounting guidance on financial instruments and more comprehensive bank audit guidance. The IAIS has also shown a strong interest in the development of sound international accounting and auditing standards, as evidenced by its participation in the IASB's Insurance Working Group and the recent Group of Thirty (G-30) effort to enhance the transparency of reinsurance activities. All of these positive efforts by regulators and supervisors reflect a growing recognition that sound accounting policies and meaningful public disclosure by banking and other financial organizations and by nonbanking companies can improve market discipline. With sufficient, accurate, and relevant information, market participants can better evaluate counterparty risks and adjust the availability and pricing of funds to promote better allocation of financial resources. Thus, more-effective market discipline can, in a sense, "regulate" the risk-taking activities of banks and other firms in ways that can complement supervision and regulation of financial institutions and foster stable financial markets.  The concept of market discipline has assumed greater importance among international banking supervisors with the publication of the new International Capital Framework, called Basel II, which seeks to strengthen the market's ability to aid bank supervisors in regulating capital adequacy. As you know, in addition to pillars on risk-based capital requirements (pillar 1) and risk-based supervision (pillar 2), Basel II includes the very important pillar 3, which addresses disclosure of risks and capital adequacy to enhance market discipline. This approach to capital regulation, with its market-discipline component, signals that sound accounting and disclosure will continue to be important parts of the global bank supervisory approach for many years to come.  In addition to disclosure and market discipline, supervisors and regulators around the world recognize the need for stronger audit and control standards for financial services firms and other companies. The quality of management information and supervisory and financial reporting is dramatically affected by internal control systems, including internal audit programs and reviews by external auditors. Sound supervisory and financial reporting, good internal controls, and quality audits are becoming more important to financial services regulators because they directly affect regulators' ability to promptly identify institutions in distress and work toward a satisfactory resolution. This shared understanding of the importance of sound audit and control practices led to an unprecedented level of cooperation among the international regulatory community--in this case, IOSCO, the Basel Committee, the IAIS, the European Commission (EC), the World Bank, and the Financial Stability Forum, which came to be known as the Monitoring Group. Working together, they were able to develop a common position on reforms. This common position served as a basis for dialogue with the leadership of IFAC about establishing a credible independent oversight authority to help enhance the integrity and objectivity of the IAASB's international audit-standards-setting processes. This led to the creation of the new Public Interest Oversight Board of IFAC, which is now busy assuming its new responsibilities. The Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) should, over time, lead to enhanced audit standards and practices around the world. The Financial Stability Forum is pleased to have been a strong supporter of this initiative, and I am happy to see that the PIOB is represented at this roundtable today together with the leaders of IFAC and many Monitoring Group representatives. The Financial Stability Forum has taken a close interest in national and international efforts to strengthen confidence in financial reporting frameworks. Stronger and more-convergent national systems bring clear financial stability and efficiency benefits. The forum's efforts have included a focus on the global-standards-setting activities of the IASB on the accounting side and the IAASB on the auditing side. The goal of global standards in both areas will require a high degree of convergence between U.S. and international standards, and efforts toward full commonality are well underway. The forum's interest reflects the strong recognition of its members that the potential financial stability and efficiency benefits are significant: high-quality global accounting standards can lead to enhanced transparency that will improve market discipline and foster stable financial markets. Likewise, external audits performed in accordance with high-quality global audit standards can ensure that financial statements are reliable, transparent, and useful to the marketplace, thus enhancing market confidence.  I am sure that we all want to see, over time, a restoration of public confidence in the quality of financial reporting and auditing, and I hope that dialogue--such as that taking place at this roundtable--and the initiatives of standards setters, can lead to standards that are fully understandable to preparers, users, and auditors; that avoid undue complexity and implementation costs; and that truly contribute to 2 BIS Review 18/2006 
transparency. Let me also stress the need to continue to implement approaches that not only improve international accounting and audit standards, but also encourage, through the implementation and enforcement of these standards, an enhancement in actual international accounting and audit practices.  However, like any professional undertaking, developing accounting and auditing standards and practices can be complicated, and gaining a shared understanding of the implications for the financial reporting chain and for financial stability can take time. Therefore, I am pleased to see that the Financial Stability Forum, the IASB, and IFAC conducted this roundtable on important financial reporting and auditing matters and that you are taking the time to contribute to the exchange of valuable information on key issues. I hope that this roundtable will continue to foster constructive dialogue among the many key stakeholders represented here and that this type of dialogue will continue after the roundtable has ended.

Svein Gjedrem: The conduct of monetary policy Comments by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of the Central Bank of Norway, on the Norges Bank Watch 2006 report, Oslo, 9 March 2006. The Charts in pdf-format can be found on the Norges Bank’s website.  Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. The speech does not contain references to the next Inflation Report or the monetary policy meeting on 16 March. *      *      * I would like to thank the CME for again providing a thorough review of Norges Bank’s conduct of monetary policy in the Norges Bank Watch report. I am also pleased to be invited to comment on the preliminary Norges Bank Watch 2006 report. It is an extensive report that discusses a number of issues.  The report discusses Norges Bank’s conduct of monetary policy in 2005 and the previous years, but also focuses on some aspects of our interpretation of the mandate for monetary policy. I will comment first of all on the relationship to the Regulation on Monetary Policy.  As last year, the report emphasises the objective of stabilising the nominal exchange rate. It points to the reference to the exchange rate in the Regulation on Monetary Policy. Last year’s recommendation that the Regulation should be printed in its entirety in each Inflation Report is reiterated.  Norges Bank’s mandate provides a basis for the conduct of monetary policy:  “Monetary policy shall be aimed at stability in the Norwegian krone’s national and international value, contributing to stable expectations concerning exchange rate developments. At the same time, monetary policy shall underpin fiscal policy by contributing to stable developments in output and employment.  Norges Bank is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy.  Norges Bank’s implementation of monetary policy shall, in accordance with the first paragraph, be oriented towards low and stable inflation. The operational target of monetary policy shall be annual consumer price inflation of approximately 2.5 per cent over time. [...]”  The responsibility for implementing monetary policy is delegated to Norges Bank pursuant to the Norges Bank Act and the appurtenant Regulation. The Bank sets interest rates based on our interpretation of the Regulation. In our interpretation, we give weight to the Government’s rationale for the Regulation, to the purpose as expressed in the first section, and to our knowledge about the relationships between the interest rate, the exchange rate, output, employment and inflation.  The first sentence in the mandate refers to the value of the krone. Stability in the krone’s internal value implies that inflation must be low and stable. Low and stable inflation contributes to economic growth and to stability in financial and property markets.  The Regulation also states that monetary policy shall be aimed at stability in the Norwegian krone’s external value, contributing to stable expectations concerning exchange rate developments. Norges Bank has not set a specific target for the level of the krone exchange rate. With open trade with other countries and free capital movements, we do not have the instruments to fine-tune the krone exchange rate. The task of monetary policy is to provide a nominal anchor. The inflation target is such an anchor. Stable inflation expectations can contribute to more stable expectations concerning the krone, but the rise in public expenditure and in prices for internationally traded goods also affect economic agents’ expectations as to the krone exchange rate.  Our interpretation of the mandate is included in the Inflation Report. An account is also given of how different developments, including movements in the exchange rate, will affect the monetary policy outlook.  Over time, the real exchange rate will be determined by conditions other than monetary policy. The real exchange rate may be measured in a number of ways: for example, by relative consumer prices and relative labour costs between Norway and its trading partners, measured in a common currency. The real exchange rate has fluctuated considerably and has at times deviated substantially from the BIS Review 17/2006 1 
average level since 1970. Nevertheless, there has been a tendency for the real exchange rate to revert to this level.  The cost level in the Norwegian economy compared with our trading partners rose sharply when the oil age began. Since then, the level has fluctuated to a certain extent without showing a clear upward or downward tendency. Over time, the level has been adjusted to the use of petroleum revenues. When we subsequently arrive at the point where the portion of our import requirements that can be financed by petroleum revenues starts to diminish, Norwegian competitiveness will have to be improved. Prize-winning research conducted by Farooq Akram (“Oil Wealth and Real Exchange Rates; the FEER for Norway”, Norges Bank Working Paper 2004/16) shows that the real exchange rate may have to revert to the levels prevailing at the end of the 1960s, before Norway became an oil nation. Such a depreciation can be achieved either through price and wage inflation that is lower in Norway than in other countries or through a depreciation in the nominal exchange rate. The latter would be the least painful method, and with a flexible exchange rate, it is also the most probable.  Norges Bank Watch also raises the issue of how monetary policy should safeguard the objective of financial stability. The report emphasises that economic literature does not provide unequivocal recommendations as to whether or how this should be done. The report nevertheless expresses concern with regard to the rise in house prices and credit growth. The report notes that asset prices, and particularly house prices, can influence household and business saving and investment decisions, and thereby affect real economic developments. Monetary policy can also influence developments in inflation, output and employment through its impact on asset prices. This description corresponds closely with our own understanding of how the economy functions.  Household debt has increased sharply since the mid-1990s. At the same time, house prices have shown a marked increase. Debt developments in the 1990s can probably be viewed to some extent as a delayed adaptation to the deregulation of the housing and credit markets in the 1980s, after many households burned their fingers immediately after deregulation. In recent years, household income growth has been solid, household confidence regarding the future has been strong and households probably perceive higher income levels as permanent. This may have resulted in a further rise in house prices and debt. In addition, low real interest rates are now making a contribution.  In countries that have had liberalised credit markets for a long time, Denmark for example, where credit markets were liberalised over a hundred years ago, the household debt-to-income ratio is higher than in other countries. Norwegian households have a high level of debt, but there are examples of countries where household debt is even higher when we compare Norway with some of our trading partners.  Developments in growth in credit to households in Norway nevertheless give cause for concern. We have examples showing that the subsequent effects of a period of unusually high house prices can persist for a very long time. At the end of the 1800s, house prices rose sharply in Christiania (now Oslo). The effects of the very high level of housing construction that resulted from the rise in prices are still perceptible in parts of Oslo. At that time, the housing market collapsed. The market for new dwellings was saturated. Real house prices did not revert to the 1899 level until the mid-1980s.  The rise in house prices has been high in Norway in recent years, but not particularly high compared with other countries. We have limited scope for restraining structural changes that occur when households increase their debt over several years to invest in housing and other property and assets. An interest rate that would effectively restrain these structural adjustments would also have an adverse impact on economic activity. But households are more vulnerable when debt levels are high. Long periods of a sharp rise in asset prices and debt may give rise to instability in output and employment at a later stage. Debt developments also affect banks’ behaviour. A particular responsibility for monitoring developments in financial institutions has been assigned to Kredittilsynet (Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway), and we are happy to have a well-equipped supervisory authority in this field.  In its forecasting of economic variables, Norges Bank uses a broad approach. Current statistics and impressions from Norges Bank regional network are important in assessing the current economic situation. In its forecasting, the Bank uses several macroeconomic models: one core model and a number of smaller models. There is, however, no mechanical relationship between the models the Bank uses and its forecasts. The Bank’s forecasts are based on a broad and varied range of information sources and include a substantial element of judgment.  2 BIS Review 17/2006 
Important components in the assessment of what constitutes a good interest rate path – and which stress the element of judgment in this assessment – are expressed in a set of criteria that should be met. The criteria are included in the Inflation Report. Criteria have been set for robustness and financial stability. It is also appropriate to assess interest-rate setting against cross-checks such as simple monetary policy rules.  The central balance is nevertheless between the inflation outlook and the outlook for capacity utilisation in the economy, expressed in the chart as the output gap. The projections are from Inflation Report 3/05. If monetary policy is to anchor inflation at the target, the interest rate must be set so that inflation moves towards the target. Inflation should be stabilised close to the target within a reasonable time horizon, normally 1-3 years. Provided inflation expectations are on target, the inflation gap and the output gap should be in reasonable proportion to each other until they close. Looking ahead, the inflation gap and the output gap should normally not be positive or negative at the same time.  Several of the recommendations from Norges Bank Watch can be translated into how we should weigh the outlook for these two variables against each other.  According to the report, Norges Bank’s inflation projections through 2005 were fairly accurate. Inflation has risen somewhat but is still very low, even 2½ years after the cyclical change. Inflation is still being restrained by the fall in prices for imported consumer goods, increased competition in a number of markets and the current period of lower nominal pay increases. The trend in prices for consumer goods over the past two or three years is a result of favourable developments in the Norwegian and global economies. Low inflation is being accompanied by real income growth and a rise in production. It cannot be ruled out that small open economies are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices. Deviations from the inflation target in Norway are broadly in line with Sweden and New Zealand, but are larger than for example in the UK and Canada.  Developments in recent years have also been influenced by the fairly large favourable disturbances to which the Norwegian economy has been exposed. Developments in Norway’s terms of trade provide an illustration of this here.  As consumers, we enjoy the benefits of falling prices for many imported goods. As a nation, we benefit from a fall in prices for the goods we import in relation to prices for the goods we export. Norway’s terms of trade are improving. The impact of the rise in oil and gas prices is particularly strong – and the domestic economy is shielded to a certain extent through the oil fund mechanism – but there have also been terms-of-trade gains in the mainland economy. The situation in Norway differs from that of our Nordic neighbours.  It should also be noted that the figures for the twelve-month rise in consumer prices are considerably more volatile in Norway than in other countries. We see from the figures that consumer prices in Norway, even when tax changes and energy products are excluded, are more volatile than indices in other countries where these products are included.  Low inflation is not the result of declining demand, activity or employment. In our conduct of monetary policy, we weigh the objective of stabilising inflation close to 2½ per cent over time against the objective of stable growth in output and employment. Since inflation is low, we have chosen to keep the interest rate at a low level and have at times considered an even lower interest rate. However, as the Norwegian economy has shown solid growth since summer 2003, we decided instead to use some time to bring inflation back to target. In a period of increasing cross-border labour flows, substantial technological advances, changes in competitive conditions and new trading patterns, we may, with our very open economy, have to accept a somewhat greater variation in inflation and deviations from the target, as we have witnessed over the past two to three years.

Tiff Macklem: Renewing the IMF - some lessons from modern central banking Remarks by Mr Tiff Macklem, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Global Interdependence Center, Philadelphia, 9 March 2006. *      *      * I'm very pleased to be here in Philadelphia, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak to the Global Interdependence Center. Your group aims to foster dialogue "on the challenges and opportunities arising from our increasingly interdependent global civilization." The globalized economy has indeed generated tremendous opportunities to create wealth and to raise living standards. But as opportunities have arisen, so too have challenges. As economies have become more interconnected through trade and financial flows in a truly global marketplace, economic developments in one location can quickly have repercussions on the other side of the globe. In 1997, what began as a currency devaluation in Thailand became a crisis with repercussions not just in Asia, but in countries as far away as Russia, Brazil, and Canada. So, the challenge we face is to find the best ways to reap the economic benefits of globalization while minimizing the risks of disruption. Today, I'd like to discuss how the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can do its part to meet this challenge. The IMF was created some 60 years ago to oversee the global monetary system in an era of fixed exchange rates. But the world has changed dramatically in 60 years. Most major currencies have been allowed to float. Financial markets are much larger, much more sophisticated, and vastly more integrated than they were 20 years ago, let alone in the 1940s. Trade has expanded enormously, and major new players have entered the global trading network. The IMF has responded to new challenges with professionalism. It's taken on new responsibilities and developed new expertise. Yet concerns have arisen that the Fund has not kept pace with the changes in the global economy. After 60 years, it's time to take a fundamental look at the role of the Fund in the global economy. Under Managing Director Rodrigo de Rato, the IMF has launched a strategic review of its role and activities. This is the opportunity to consider what kind of a Fund we need to meet the challenges of the global economy in the 21st century. But to do this right, we must be ambitious. I'm also pleased to be part of your "Central Banking Series" of speakers, because central banks can bring a valuable perspective to the discussion. Central banks have a large stake in a sound international monetary order, and thus have a profound interest in the IMF. And central banks have had to adapt to the same forces in the global economy that have affected the IMF: the collapse of fixed exchange rates, the expansion of private capital flows, the evolution of financial markets, and so on.  What I propose to do today is discuss how the Bank of Canada and other central banks have evolved in response to these changing circumstances. Then I'll outline how the lessons central banks have learned can be distilled into four key principles. I'll conclude by offering some thoughts on how these same principles could prove useful as we consider the IMF of the future.  The principles of modern central banking For good reasons, Canada returned to a floating exchange rate in 1970.1 With the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates shortly thereafter, other major industrialized countries followed Canada's lead. Unfortunately, the Bank of Canada, like many other central banks, did not take full advantage of the monetary independence that comes with having a flexible exchange rate. Without the anchor of a fixed exchange rate, and with no other monetary anchor in its place, Canada, like many other countries, suffered the effects of high inflation in the 1970s. Inflation reduced the ability of the price system to allocate economic resources efficiently; savings and investment decisions were distorted; and the economy went through boom and bust cycles.  Central banks, including the Bank of Canada, struggled with this problem, and from this bitter experience came a search for the right anchor. We, and others, experimented with monetary aggregates as intermediate targets. But deregulation and financial innovation weakened the reliability                                                       1  The floating exchange rate has served Canada's open economy well. Canada first adopted a floating exchange rate in 1950. In 1962, it returned to a fixed regime, but since 1970, it has allowed the dollar to float. BIS Review 17/2006 1 
of money measures, and the relationship between money growth and inflation proved to be unstable. By the end of the 1980s, it became clear that price stability should be the Bank of Canada's pre-eminent objective, and that we should aim more directly at achieving it.  In 1991, Canada took the bold step of formalizing this objective with an explicit inflation target. Our inflation-target objective, which is established jointly with the Government of Canada, aims to keep inflation at the 2 per cent midpoint of a 1 to 3 per cent target range. The target has proven to be a very effective anchor. Inflation has been low and stable, and we've experienced solid growth in output and employment.  Canada was the second major country to adopt an inflation target. Today more than 20 countries have such targets. In other words, there's a good deal of international experience with inflation targeting. As in Canada, this experience has been very positive: inflation targeting, working in tandem with a floating exchange rate, has generally resulted in low inflation and sustained economic growth.  Stepping back, and looking beyond these positive results, we can distinguish four key characteristics of a credible and effective monetary policy framework: clear objectives and effective tools; legitimacy; the effective use of markets; and transparency and accountability. Let me say a few words about each of these in turn. First, clear objectives and effective tools. The Bank of Canada's monetary policy has one clear objective-to keep inflation at 2 per cent. And it has one instrument with which to get the job done-the target for the overnight interest rate.  Second, legitimacy. The inflation target is not just the Bank of Canada's target, but also the government's. This adds legitimacy to the monetary policy objective, thereby strengthening it. But legitimacy also comes from our experience of low inflation and good economic outcomes, with the result that there is now broad support among Canadians for anchoring monetary policy to a low inflation target.  Third, monetary policy works best when it is market based. We learned some valuable lessons in the 1970s. We learned that direct controls on wages and prices do not work beyond the short run, and that they introduce a myriad of distortions, which reduce market efficiency. We also learned that direct controls on credit expansion are difficult to calibrate and enforce. They also reduce the efficiency of the financial system as it allocates resources in the economy. Today, monetary policy is implemented entirely through financial markets. By controlling the overnight interest rate, monetary policy influences interest rates along the yield curve, as well as other asset prices. These, in turn, influence spending, and, ultimately, inflation. We have found that the transmission of monetary policy works most effectively when the central bank implements policy through markets, when it maintains a credible policy goal, and when it communicates its objectives and actions clearly. This leads me naturally to the fourth characteristic - transparency and accountability. One of the most important things we have learned with inflation targeting is that monetary policy works best when it is well understood. The explicit inflation target is the centrepiece of our communications on monetary policy - it helps to anchor inflation expectations, and it makes it easier for us to explain our actions, and for people to judge our performance. It provides a strong incentive for us to meet the objective and to be accountable.  Taken together, these are the characteristics of effective, modern central banking. But I think that one can go further and say that these characteristics are useful principles that apply to the broader realm of public policy making. Let me now turn to the topic of IMF renewal, and talk about how these same principles can be applied to the task at hand.  Principle-based renewal at the IMF The place to start is clear objectives and effective tools for achieving those objectives. The IMF's first Article of Agreement states that it should "promote international monetary co-operation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems." In the globalized, market economy of the 21st century, what this really means is the promotion of global financial stability by supporting a market-based international monetary order. I hope that there's a broad consensus that this should be the objective of the IMF. I view the challenge facing the Fund as being how best to fulfill this objective.  2 BIS Review 17/2006 
The main tool is surveillance. But surveillance needs to be more effective. This means two things. First, surveillance should be more multilateral, putting greater emphasis on the linkages between members, the spillover of one country's policy choices on other countries, and the joint risks that this implies. The reality is that in an increasingly globalized economy, our understanding of these linkages and spillovers is not as good as it should be. The Fund staff is an enormously talented group of men and women. We have to ensure that they undertake the research and analysis needed to understand the changing nature of global linkages. But understanding these linkages is not enough. We need a forum where risks are debated openly, frankly, and comprehensively by national policy-makers. In turn, this implies less emphasis on bilateral communication between the IMF and a given country and more multilateral discussions among countries, supported by the IMF. Making surveillance more effective also means strengthening the analysis of the linkages between the financial sector and the real economy. In recent years, the Fund has devoted considerable energy to developing sound standards and codes for assessing the financial infrastructure of its member countries. This financial sector surveillance needs to be better integrated into IMF country reviews. This will allow potential risks to be identified earlier so that authorities can address any problems, rather than calling on the Fund for financial assistance in the midst of a crisis. Achieving this integration may require re-thinking the Fund's internal structure to ensure that all facets of its work feed effectively into its surveillance and provide sound analysis of the interaction of economic and financial developments and risks, both within and between countries. Let me now turn to the second key principle - legitimacy. The Fund's effectiveness, and hence its ability to promote global financial stability, is what ultimately gives it legitimacy and credibility. At the same time, its effectiveness depends on its legitimacy as a truly global institution, and on a shared sense of trust and responsibility among its members. Global issues can't be effectively addressed if key players feel that they don't have an adequate voice as IMF members. In this respect, it is clear that important aspects of the Fund's governance arrangements have not kept pace with changes in the global economy. In particular, quotas and voting power at the Fund need to better reflect the growing power of Asian and other emerging-market economies. The issue of quota and voting power is complex and will persist for years to come, since Asia is likely to continue to grow faster than other major regions. This suggests the need for a comprehensive solution, and we should work towards this end. But we also need to be pragmatic. We need to make concrete progress on the quota issue in the short term to show that members are serious about aligning the representation of Asian members with their economic weight. Of course, with a larger voice comes greater responsibility. So let's be clear: a larger stake for Asian members implies that they should be prepared to shoulder their fair share of the responsibility for promoting global financial stability as part of the international monetary order.  This brings me to the third principle - effective use of markets. As I have already highlighted, the role of the Fund in the 21st century should be to promote financial stability by supporting a market-based international monetary order. This means that the IMF must work to ensure that the international financial infrastructure is sound, that countries pursue sustainable policies, and that incentives encourage the appropriate pricing of risk and the efficient allocation of resources. It also means that the IMF should play a more active role in establishing the "rules of the game," clear rules that support a market-based international monetary order. Consider exchange rates, for example. Tim Adams, the U.S. Treasury's Under Secretary for International Affairs, recently called on the IMF to demonstrate "strong leadership on multilateral exchange rate surveillance." Specifically, he called on the IMF to "improve its tools and advocacy to persuade countries to exit unsustainable exchange regimes early on, rather than waiting for perfect circumstances that never come." More broadly, I would suggest that the IMF needs to bring pressure to bear on national public policies that thwart adjustment. Delaying adjustment does not make the need for adjustment go away. It simply increases the risk that the adjustment - when it comes - will be abrupt and disorderly. A highly visible example of this risk is the issue of "global imbalances," which is shorthand for the large U.S. current account deficit that is mirrored by large surpluses in Asia and, increasingly, in major oil-exporting countries. If these imbalances are to be resolved in a way that is consistent with maximizing global growth, significant adjustments are required. Markets can lead these adjustments, but they need to be allowed to work effectively. This means letting real exchange rates adjust in countries with large current account surpluses, like China; reducing unsustainable fiscal deficits in the United States; and making labour markets more flexible in Europe. The IMF should play a lead role in bringing the right players together, facilitating discussion, and relying on markets to achieve the necessary adjustments. BIS Review 17/2006 3 
Markets should also play a greater role in crisis resolution. The Fund has been accused of doing too much "exceptional lending." Indeed, in some cases, this lending has delayed the needed actions and adjustments. Essentially, both sovereign borrowers and creditors wait to see if the Fund will put new money on the table. Strict implementation of exceptional access limits - that is, clear rules of the game for the Fund's own activities - would reduce the uncertainty associated with Fund lending and create incentives for creditors and lenders to negotiate when negative economic shocks render debt levels unsustainable. The Fund could facilitate these negotiations by offering its good offices to promote a timely, orderly restructuring of private claims. The Fund's effectiveness in this capacity depends critically, however, on its perceived independence. It will not be viewed as a disinterested adjudicator if it is also a major creditor. The Fund can reduce some of the uncertainty that impedes debt restructurings by providing independent analysis of the future growth prospects of the country concerned, advice on possible adjustment measures, and an assessment of the global economic and financial outlook. With this information at hand, creditors and debtors can then seek market-based solutions.  The fourth and final characteristic is transparency and accountability. I said earlier that the Fund needs to be clear about its main objectives and its policy framework. The IMF must also ensure that clear lines of responsibility within the organization support the framework. And it must be transparent about the reasons for its decisions. In other words, the Fund needs a governance structure that helps it achieve its goals and holds individuals accountable. Currently, decision-making responsibilities are divided among the Board of Governors, the Executive Board of Directors, and the Managing Director and staff. But the division of responsibilities among these groups is not, in practice, always clearly defined. Accountability is dispersed, and decision-making lacks transparency.  The IMF would be more effective if the Executive Board focused on setting strategic direction, as well as ensuring that policies are sound and that objectives are met. The Managing Director would then be responsible for policy implementation, and be accountable to the Board. This framework would help to ensure that the responsibility for policy formulation and implementation was clear and borne appropriately by the members of the Board and the Managing Director, respectively. Toward this end, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King has recently suggested establishing a non-resident Executive Board that meets periodically, rather than almost continuously, and that focuses on strategic direction and oversight. Accountability and transparency of the Board's decision-making would also be enhanced with more frequent and more timely reporting. Finally, and very importantly, surveillance and analysis must be, and seen to be, independent of political influence. Conclusion I'd like to conclude by underscoring a key point. The progress made by central banks in furthering the economic well-being of their citizens has largely been the result of determining the most appropriate objective - low and stable inflation - and determining how best to achieve it in a transparent and accountable fashion. For many central banks, this has meant inflation targeting. I've suggested that there are lessons here for the International Monetary Fund. A more effective IMF really does matter. In a world of floating exchange rates, large private capital flows, and liberalized trade, we need an effective forum in which the issues that shape the global economy can be discussed with candour and good will, and in which problems can be resolved. The IMF could be that forum. But it needs to become more legitimate, that is, more representative of an international economic community where all members share responsibility for promoting the common good of international financial stability. The IMF needs to operate with clear objectives; effective, market-based tools to achieve these objectives; and a governance framework that supports sound decision-making and accountability.  The need for change is pressing. As the risks associated with global imbalances grow in importance, the IMF will be tested. I very much hope that a significantly more effective institution will emerge from the strategic review currently under way. If we can get it right, a more effective IMF will be central to maximizing the benefits of globalization.  Indeed, the renewal of the International Monetary Fund is tremendously important, not just for Americans and Canadians, but for all nations in this increasingly interdependent world. 4 BIS Review 17/2006 
Ardian Fullani: Remittances: An opportunity for growth - the Albanian migration to Italy as a case study Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the Conference on Remittances, Bari, 4 March 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to speak to you today on the occasion of the Conference on Remittances. I would like to congratulate the World Bank and the Puglia Region for co-organizing this esteemed international event. I greatly appreciate your partnership and this opportunity to explore with you the possible ways for a sustainable growth, formalization and higher effectiveness of remittances. I would like to open my remarks by asking a simple question. Why are remittances our main topic today?  Remittances represent the most direct and immediate benefit to emigrants families and to the economy. Remittance flows to developing countries are now estimated to be twice as much as the development aid these countries receive. In some countries like Albania, they noticeably exceed foreign direct investment. Therefore, governments nowadays are paying more and more attention in their development strategies to remittance flows as an important financial source to boost economic development, especially in depressed areas where economic conditions force people to migrate. A key input for these policies is the economic and the logistic framework behind migration and remittance. This conference and its underlying case-study make a great contribution to these developing efforts. Since the beginning of the transition, the volume of remittances to Albania has grown rapidly. Indeed, remittance flows are increasingly important relative to other foreign exchange-earning activities, representing around 14 percent of GDP, 70 percent of exports, and 33 percent of imports. Italy is the major migration destination country for Albanians. On the other hand, Albania is the number one recipient country in terms of remittance flows from Italy to other countries. Therefore, remittance services from Italy to Albania have become a topic of great interest. The Italian-Albanian remittance corridor is a relevant case to examine the effects of remittances on local communities and to discuss the ways of making these flows more efficient and less costly.  A recent survey of the Bank of Albania shows that remittances have had positive impact across all Albanian regions. The influence is slightly higher in less developed regions alleviating to some extent income disparities. Remittances have become a critical source of income for households, reaching 33 percent of disposable income of an average family recipient and almost 40 percent in rural areas. The recipients of remittances are from all social groups, including middle income class (60 percent) as well as the low income class (27 percent). Our estimates show that the level and severity of poverty are significantly reduced among those households receiving remittances, with greater influence on severity rather than the level of poverty. Remittances are mostly used for imported consumer goods, services, and for the purchase or construction of houses. A small share is saved or invested in businesses, mainly in agricultural sector. Therefore, the impact of remittances in creating new jobs has been limited. In this view, I do not want to downplay the importance of remittances, but to draw attention to additional structural reforms needed to enhance their impact in the economy. It is not a coincidence that after reaching the level of 14 percent of GDP, the growth rate of remittances has been as constant as that of foreign direct investments in Albania. This shows that in the mid-term, there is no difference between the decision of foreign investors and remitters to invest in Albania. Of course, emigrants may have a better knowledge of domestic markets. They are more connected to their home-country and react faster than foreign investors. Nevertheless, they demand guarantees for their investments as much as foreign investors do. Therefore, both the volume of remittances and their effectiveness largely depend on improvements of Albanian business environment.  While efforts to speed up reforms aiming to improve business environment are underway, especially now with the most recent signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement, a question still remains: is there any other measure that may enhance the contribution of remittances in the development? The Bank of Albania in cooperation with other governmental and non-governmental institutions has been considering some concrete measures, which I have already highlighted in a BIS Review 16/2006 1 
conference organized by EBRD on these issues last September. I would like to briefly mention some of them here again, with some new insights. First, improving our knowledge about remittances remains critical for the assessment of policies, which directly impact the developing role of remittances in the economy. The improved information is needed not simply to assist policies on remittances but also financial infrastructure (e.g. by reducing transaction costs) and to understand the impact on poverty. The Bank of Albania has continuously emphasized the importance of accurate estimation of capital inflows in the form of emigrants’ remittances. For better statistics we have been assisted by IMF missions to bring the methodology in defining remittances closer to the international standards. Also, there is a close cooperation with our main economic partners, Italy and Greece, as the main destinations of the Albanian emigrants, to harmonize our methodologies in order to improve the estimation accuracy of remittances. The report of the World Bank on the Italian-Albanian corridor is also a great contribution to improve our understanding of remittances, and on behalf of the Albanian authorities I express our gratitude for this support.  Second, formalizing the inflow of remittances is a very important moment. More than half of remittances enter the country through informal channels. Our surveys show that the bulk of remittances to Albania are channeled through unofficial sources; physically brought by the emigrants (59 percent), friends and relatives (23 percent). This is partially a reflection of the short geographical distance between the two countries.  However, this high flow of remittances through unofficial channels also asks for actions to make official channels more attractive in terms of efficiency, safety, cost and anonymity. As the study team has found out, emigrants in Italy have a high banking utilization rate – more than 50 percent have bank accounts. On the Albanian side, this figure drops to less than 20 percent. Emigrant families’ access to banks is suboptimal despite the considerable geographical expansion of commercial banks in recent years. In contrast with other remittance-receiving countries, banks in Albania still have only a small market share in remittance services. However, there are encouraging signs of demand for new technologies, innovative partnerships and entry points to reach disadvantaged groups.  The high fees of the money transfer applied by the banks are often brought up as a motive why individuals do not prefer this service. Nevertheless, there is already an Albanian commercial bank, which offers transfers from Italy to Albania without charging any fee for amounts up to 250 euros a day, when the average monthly delivery of emigrants usually ranges from 100 to 150 euros. In the meantime, there are several other banks that provide the same service for transfers from Greece. Actually, we are examining the possibilities to lower the transfer costs through broader bilateral agreements between the two countries.   Even though, money transfer companies provide transfer services at reasonable rates with a good geographical coverage, we still observe a lot of cash entering the country in bags. I retain, this is more a regulatory problem rather than the preference of emigrants to go informal. The disparity between our two countries in terms of bank accounts accessibility is largely a reflection of the fact that in Italy you cannot get your salary if you do not provide with your bank account number. The anti-cash program initiated by the Bank of Albania clearly indicates that in order to lower the cash economy, we have to abolish the option of cash payments, including here salaries of the private sector, payments of utilities, etc. Our bank is fully committed to support this process at all levels, being these regulatory or technical. Of course, this comes at some cost, which in case of remittances is going from zero rates that informal or cash channels offer to some positive commissions required by formal channels. I understand the concerns raised by some analysts that legislation on exchange rate control or anti-money laundering could increase transfer rates further and push people to go underground. This calls for a revision of regulation that does not penalize the volume of remittances. As I mentioned earlier, the formalization of the economy is a major component of improving business environment in Albania. Therefore, “forcing” individuals to get into formal channels while comes at a short term cost of some positive rates most probably will have the long term benefit of signaling the serious intentions that we are moving on the right directions to both emigrants and foreign investors. For recipient families, accessibility to financial institutions plays a more important role due to large percentage of receipts delivered straight to the recipient’s door. In fact, the disconnection between the physical receipt of funds and the location of the financial institution may have a great impact on disintermediation among recipients. Assuming that receivers can exercise some control over the mode and location of receipt, the geographic proximity of a branch or the ability to pick up a remittance in an 2 BIS Review 16/2006 
office (as required by Western Union) can determine an institution’s ability to compete in the remittance market of the Albania, not to mention the possibility of mobilizing savings from these new potential clients. Remittances can be a point entry for many remitters and their families to the formal financial system. Many emigrant families are either not familiarized with banks or have limited access with financial institutions. The Bank of Albania through its public communication strategy is aiming to bring the public closer to banking products and services, including transfers. No matter the small size of remittance amounts. Even those small shares left by recipient families in bank accounts could assist economic development as more funds will be available in banks to provide loan products to private sector. The same concern was initially expressed about public administration salaries. Now, this service is provided by the banking system, and we see the power of pooling small amounts. For commercial banks, their ability to market additional value-added services, such as savings products, loans or other types of credit to remittance recipients, will require the achievement of a critical mass of customer acquisition, as well as a higher technology delivery mechanism, to bring down the average cost of the investment required to serve that client.  Micro credit programs and qualitative improvements of banking infrastructure, concerted with introduction of new financial instruments will also help to attract more remittances. Promoting microfinance organizations as participants in remittances market, could offer certain advantages to the microfinance sector, to the government and to remittance recipients. The costs of this expansion would primarily fall to the regulatory and supervisory authorities. We already took an important step in bringing these institutions under the Bank of Albania supervision which we expect to improve their status in the market by enhancing the confidence of operating with them. Microfinance institutions are already providing small amount loans to the low income class. Their existing programs allow them to leverage their network and geographic reach to assist remittance senders and receivers in gaining access to low cost financial services, as well as access micro-saving and investment products. The third area of our efforts is to channel the workers’ remittances toward country’s development needs. The formalization is a necessary step but does not ensure the role of remittances as a developing instrument. It is often claimed that emigrants are not the most preferred clients of banks, since this category is considered to have more unstable jobs and low level of income. First of all, this perception is not entirely correct and the results of the Italian team support the fact that the pool of emigrant savings is becoming significant enough to be a profitable business. The latest Italian bank entering the market in Albania (Banca Italiana di Sviluppo) is another witness of this reality. However, I would like to see the other banks operating in Albania to be as aggressive as their Italian counterparts in competing for this pool of savings sooner rather than later. There are also other financial services that could be offered to the remittance recipients. For instance, linking workers’ remittances with investments by channeling remittance flows toward micro-credit loans or projects; or supporting migrants’ contribution and emigrants’ communities in the development of the country.  A concerning signal comes out from our survey showing emigrants low intention to invest in either private ventures and/or public developing projects. It tells us that the issue of remittances goes beyond the financial framework. Therefore we should think of new ways to improve incentives of emigrants to invest back in Albania, like the recent government initiative to offer to emigrants the opportunity to return and invest in their country by enjoying a three year exemption from the profit and personal income taxes.  In conclusion, I would add that a distinctive feature that makes remittances particularly important instruments for the economic development is their relative stability compared to private capital and financial flows. In contrast to financial flows that showed a high volatility during 1990s, remittances continued to flow much more steadily. In terms of the “life cycle” duration of individual remittances, theory holds that the longer the duration of migrant status, the lower the probability of large flows of remittances. This urges us to speed up our efforts to exploit the potential of remittances sooner rather than later.  Their immense role calls for new ways of achieving a sustainable growth, a full formalization and higher effectiveness of remittances. Obviously, this is not a battle we can win today. It requires a lot of attention, good will, but also a complete enforcement strategy. Thank you. BIS Review 16/2006 3 
Nicholas Le Pan: Basel II implementation – assessing progress to date and next steps Remarks by Mr Nicholas Le Pan, Superintendent, Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, Canada; Chairman of the Basel Accord Implementation Group; and Vice Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the 7th Annual Global Association of Risk Professionals 2006, New York, 28 February 2006. *      *      * Let me thank GARP for inviting me here today. There is a famous actress, it might have been Tallulah Bankhead, and she had a very deep voice. Her view was not to worry much about risks. She said, “Whatever happens, happens,” and, “If you got to go, you got to go”. Well that’s not the attitude towards risk and risk management (or implementing Basel II) that we need. I think more of “The General”, George Patton, whose quote is, “Take calculated risks. That is quite different than being rash”. I think some of what General Patton had to say is very relevant to today’s risk management environment and also to Basel II. Let me be clear – I don’t think regulators in the Basel Committee have had an irresponsible “you got to go” attitude to implementing Basel II. Hugely important, but sometimes forgotten, is that Basel II better relates capital to risk. That is key to supporting financial stability and key to supporting improved risk management practices. This is a huge benefit in my view-for consumers of financial services, for banks, for regulators and for economies. Assessing impacts One of the biggest challenges in implementing Basel II is dealing with the uncertainty of impacts. It is not possible to precisely plan the impacts, push the green start button and expect that there will be no surprises. Nor is it possible to adopt Basel II and believe that it will lead to minimal impacts on the capital of each and every bank. Implementing Basel II has risks. Like General Patton, we want the risks to be understood, we don’t want to be rash. We want protection against surprises, and we want confidence that our ability to react-as banks, as regulators-is up to the task. We want the static analysis of impacts to be reasonable-but we will only get a really good feel of how the new system will work when we are in the parallel run period and the new system is up and running. And no fiddling with the rules now can change that.  And that is why it is so dangerous to just focus on the arithmetic-risk management and regulation and supervision is not just about arithmetic and higher mathematics, neither is Basel II. Nor can we just focus on adjusting the scaling factor as a means of “getting it right”. That is why we have floors-protection. That is why we have the ability to work with banks, and to regulate if necessary, to constrain the use of certain parameters in Pillar I. That’s why we can require a better, more robust job by a bank in taking account of downturn conditions-something that has not been well done, or done at all, by some banks in their quantitative impact assessments provided to regulators and reported publicly. That is why we have Pillar 2-which in my country, Canada, includes target capital levels of 7/10 (Tier I/Tier II) to be considered well capitalized. We don’t just care about minimum capital, we also care about the actual capital held by banks. As regulators and banks and policymakers we can focus too much on Pillar 1.  That is why countries like Canada are keeping our leverage test (though we have indicated we will review the levels of the test to make sure that it does not wipe out all the benefits for individual banks). I gather the leverage test has been a bit of an issue here in the U.S. as well! Lets also remember the important role for judgment in implementation-a theme I return to again and again. Consider the role of judgments in assessing impacts. A number of major banks have done estimates or simulations of how the Basel II Pillar 1 minimum capital will move over a credit cycle, BIS Review 16/2006 1 
recognizing that we are, at the moment, in some of the best credit conditions we have seen for a while. The estimates for peak to trough variation in minimum capital range from 15-30% over a cycle. I encourage more banks to do this type of analysis. So if we set the minimum capital requirement today exactly equal to the capital under the old system then, when we have a downturn, minimum requirements might be 15 - 20% higher than under the current rules–is that what we want? I don’t think so. You can’t get away completely from these over-the-cycle effects–they are inherent in a system that is more risk based. I would even argue they are desirable in telling markets what is happening to the riskiness of a bank over a cycle. But, that means judgment is going to be required in assessing impacts and deciding how to react, not overreact, to them. But banks’ know about cyclicality too. And banks have lots of incentives to smooth out the path of their actual capital over a cycle–fluctuations in actual capital along with minimum capital are likely to lead to consequences in the marketplace, raising capital at certain times in a cycle is costly, managing the bank when there are big changes in actual capital could be quite disruptive. Home host issues While there is not going to be perfect uniformity of implementation I believe that a reasonable degree of consistency across major jurisdictions is going to be hugely, hugely important. That’s not only to deal with level playing field issues, but it is also trying to make sure that the investments that banks have made are dissipated through multiple duplications and inconsistent approaches to how Basel II is implemented. The glass is half full, but it is also half empty in that regard as we sit here today. However I take heart from the fact that there are better-working processes in place than before, including at the AIG (Accord Implementation group), and we continue to make progress. Industry concerns about home-host implementation issues are rising. Some arise from the US decisions to delay implementation and use different floor calculations. There is uncertainty about how U.S. and foreign banks will be treated in various jurisdictions. Some of this will hopefully be alleviated when the US decisions on implementing Basel II and Basel 1a are issued. There are genuine concerns re: systems costs. There are worries about potential level playing field issues in how the US intends to implement Basel II and Basel 1a relative to approaches in other jurisdictions. Many major banking groups want to have a number of their subsidiaries remain either on Basel I or on a version of the Basel II standardised approach that is as close to Basel I as possible, at least for a transitional period. Banks are concerned that without this approach, systems costs of implementation will be materially higher if they are forced to develop “throwaway” systems that will only be in use for one or two years. The industry has sensed a slowing down of so-called supervisory colleges. AIG members generally agree that these efforts have slowed down, but often members’ focus on solving home-host issues has simply shifted to more bilateral interaction with host supervisors. Going forward, AIG members anticipate an acceleration of both multilateral and bilateral work later in the year as approval work intensifies. In some cases differences across jurisdictions in interpretation of key provisions are becoming apparent. For example, supervisory expectations for the use test as well as implementation of the downturn LGD (Loss-Given-Default) principles. The implementation implications of areas of the Framework where there is not uniformity of treatment (e.g. differences in the definition of default) are also becoming more apparent. In areas like the AMA (Advanced Measurement Approach) hybrid approach, we have industry waiting for further supervisory guidance and supervisors waiting for greater industry initiative. There are also areas of the framework, particularly Pillar 2, where it has long been clear that country approaches would differ. The closer to the implementation date, the more some banks are worried about the implications of these differences in terms of capital. As well, banks and supervisors have in some cases been focussed more on the homehost aspects of Pillar 1 and issues of application of 2 BIS Review 16/2006 
Pillar 2 within a banking group, and the degree of host-home reliance. These issues are now coming more to the fore. Finally, home-host implementation issues are in some cases raising other issues not related to Basel II. Some of these industry concerns are due to residual unrealistic expectations – there will not be uniformity of implementation or a very strong lead supervisor role, no matter how much industry would like it. I want to emphasise that some are making home-host issues a scapegoat. For example, a number of banks are opting to adopt as much as possible simple approaches in host jurisdictions. Some observers have claimed that this is a sign of failure of home-host cooperation. It is essential that supervisors and policymakers take a reasoned perspective on these issues. In particular a number of banks who are choosing simpler approaches are doing so for their own reasons such as focussing their scarce resources on advanced approaches in the home country. Attributing these trends solely to home-host regulatory issues is unhelpful.  Where is this going? I believe in the short term for many large banking groups there are a limited range of portfolios and countries where close cooperation is required in implementation of advanced approaches for credit or operational risk. It will be important to continue to move these discussions forward. I think over time the number of these discussions will expand. In some cases host supervisors need to decide if simplified versions of Basel II approaches can be made available to foreign banks in their country to ease implementation costs. Canada has tabled its approach in this regard at the AIG and Core Principles Working Group (CPWG) meetings for information and it is available publicly. A number of jurisdictions indicated willingness in principle to consider these types of approaches. This willingness needs to be converted, however, into practical outcomes. I believe the infrastructure for enhanced home-host cooperation (both bilaterally and through colleges) on approval/validation issues has been put in place. It needs to be used as approvals accelerate in the second half of the year. The AIG will continue to collect information on progress and share experiences.  In addition, communication between the AIG and industry on frequently asked questions about implementation issues needs to be enhanced. The AIG has plans in place to do so. We can’t solve all issues and some cannot be discussed fruitfully now until further adoption decisions are made in certain countries.  There are selected areas where indication of some flexibility in implementation would be beneficial. I am encouraged by many supervisors willingness in this regard. One example is cases where the use test could be implemented flexibly (e.g. strict interpretation of the use test may not be appropriate regarding either downturn LGDs or using Basel II analytics in provisioning). There are areas of implementation where the opportunity for supervisors to share experiences on a more “real-time” basis would be beneficial in achieving more consistency. At its last meeting the AIG had a major discussion and sharing of information on LGD issues. Several banks presented their approaches to downturn LGDs for portfolios like mortgages where this is a very relevant issue. The AIG is establishing a monthly “clearinghouse” conference call on LGD issues. It will allow supervisors to share experiences regarding LGDs in the applications they are considering, identify and discuss minor LGD implementation issues as they arise, identify any further LGD issues that other groups should address, and share information on what supervisors are telling banks about LGD issues such as where supervisors are allowing banks not to compute downturn LGDs, and criteria for acceptable downturn methodologies, and what is the range of outcomes for LGD on certain portfolios. Supervisors need to decide in what circumstances they are going to accept AMA allocations and banks need to be more responsive in proposing more risk based allocation methods. The AIGOR (Operational Risk Subgroup of the Basel Committee Accord Implementation Group) is working on an elaboration of the home-host information sharing principles as they apply to operational risk as a way of encouraging home-host cooperation and continues to invite banks to present their AMA approaches, including allocation methods. Now what’s going to happen for banks as a result of those so called gap year issues and different transition periods? Some of that we can’t know until the U.S. has actually published their rules. And we’ve certainly been encouraging the U.S. authorities to clarify as much as possible, and hopefully in BIS Review 16/2006 3 
ways that reduce the need for foreign banks operating in the US to have to throw away or redo systems. But U.S. authorities have also been helpful in clarifying that gap year and floor differences don’t necessarily mean problems for foreign banks status in the U.S. But if a major foreign bank with material operations in my country was going to have a very large reduction in consolidated capital I’d certainly be interested in knowing more about the reasons for that. I also welcome the U.S. authorities stated willingness to help other supervisors with respect to U.S. portfolios of foreign banks. Now let’s flip this the other way around. There are a range of major US institutions who would ideally like to use advanced techniques outside of the US in advance of them being able to qualify in the US. AIG discussions suggest that this is very unlikely to be acceptable to regulators except in the few cases where material retail portfolios in a host country have modeling, data, analytics and risk oversight largely locally. Obviously, working all this out will require ongoing interaction between regulators and banking organizations. You can’t mandate cooperation and coordination through international agreement, especially since what this means in practice will vary from case to case. A good deal of the platform for enhanced cooperation has already been laid. And again we are talking about judgment and trust, because those are key to reliance. It will be hugely important that regulators and banks use feedback mechanisms and existing relationships to identify issues that are anomalous, to promote more cooperation, to enhance trust and reliance. And we have to be prepared to put significant ongoing effort into it for home host relationships to be a success story in implementing Basel II. Difficult areas for implementation While many aspects of Basel II are challenging, there are several areas that I know are of particular focus to the industry. One is downturn LGDs. The principles that were developed on implementation of these are important. They are sensible and practical, such as making clear that banks can produce material to show that default weighted long run average LGDs are enough for some portfolios. On the incremental default risk charge in the trading book we are making progress, together with securities regulators, in responding to industry suggestions for what expectations ought to be for banks incorporating this into their capital calculations. Doing so is hugely important and is a major contribution to dealing with issues of tail risk and illiquidity raised in the recent Corrigan report. We have produced good material on validation issues (with more upcoming on expectations re vendor models). The sharing of experiences in validation and actual interaction with banks has been very useful in promoting consistency. I think that will intensify as the year progresses. Looking forward I would urge more focus on stress testing and on overall governance. Stress tests need to be meaningful and are hard to design well. The results then need to be taken into account by bank management, with good exercise of judgment. I expect this to be an area that the AIG will come back to. Without being formulaic we also need to recognize that Basel II results in an increased richness of information on a bank’s risks and capital and some of that should find its way to the Board of Directors.  Importance of other pillars Let’s not forget Basel II is also about market based regulation. It’s fascinating what proportion of the time people spend on Pillar one. We forget Pillar two and Pillar three a little bit at our peril, collectively. I believe that disclosure is broadly in pretty good shape in the much of the banking industry, but there are certain areas where Basel II is going to put requirements and forces in place to enhance disclosure, and that’s a hugely important part of better judging what’s behind banking organizations approach to risk and what’s behind banking organizations approach to capital. And I think that will be important from a counter party perspective and I think it will also be important from an analysts and financial community perspective. And the challenges for banks in better relating their desired capital better to risk, and for supervisors in judging that assessment, are real. 4 BIS Review 16/2006 
Delay issues Now some have called for an overall delay in all countries in order to sort things out. I think that misses the point, even if it were possible without amending legislation or rules in a number of countries. In part the real impacts of Basel II are only going to be known with more certainty once we actually go live, but with the protections I talked about earlier. I respect the U.S. decision regarding the delay. I understand the decision, though I wish it hadn’t been necessary. It certainly makes major banks in the United States and from outside the United States worry about cross border implementation challenges and I understand that added worry. In Canada, based on our discussion with banks, I believed it was better to proceed than to drag this out. We had more flexibility to deal with in implementation issues as we were not requiring our major banks to be on advanced approaches as the U.S. was. We realize fully that there are challenges. But we believe that major Canadian banks are making steady progress in implementation and we believe that that progress is consistent with international peers and that issues are solvable. Implementation plans for the more complex and advanced approaches under Basel II pose significant execution risk. I don’t believe that those challenges are unique for a project of this size and importance. And while those risks may potentially impact the implementation date of IRB compliance systems for individual portfolios or individual banks in Canada, we believe there is sufficient flexibility in the new framework to accommodate contingency for bank plans, if necessary, so that banks can have a Basel II compliant capital calculation by the start date. I have had a look at the initial results from the QIS 5 in Canada. We’re still in the process of assessing the impacts. Some of the results have too big a reduction for my liking, but we need to understand that better. Some aspects of the framework were not included by banks in their calculations such as downturn conditions or the new trading book rules that would have raised capital. But I will say that at this moment I do not see any highly worrisome results that would call into question the whole framework. I’ve been consistently saying to institutions in Canada for some years now that, if they want to come with double digit reductions in capital for credit risk in the early years, they are going to have a heck of a lot of explaining to do. But remember that Basel II is more risk sensitive, so the notion that minimum capital for some organizations is going to go down, and for others it might go up, is a notion that I fundamentally embrace. We may have important discussions, about how much, over what time frame, and so on. But fundamentally we accepted, when we signed on, that that was the world we were going to be in. Success factors Let me close with a few success factors for people to keep in mind. Basel II is a major IT project, so a lot of this is about how well banks manage a major IT project and the risks in those kinds of projects. Don’t forget pillar two and pillar three. Don’t forget the need for ongoing two way communication between regulators and banks. Don’t forget the banks role in talking to host supervisors if you want cross border implementation to go better. More effective relationships between home and host supervisors is a success factor. I think we’ve built a lot of the basis for an enhanced relationship with the help of the AIG and we’re going to need to continue to use those as we get to the serious stages of implementation. Improving risk measurement and management is a key success factor, and I’ve indicated today areas where I think more focus is needed. Lastly some softer things. Basel II is about an increase in the willingness and capability of all the participants to make complicated judgments. It is about an increase in the degree of cooperation and trust between supervisors in a major banking group. And it is an increase in the level of richness of discussions within banks and between banks and their supervisors about risk and capital. I think all of those are good things.  Thank you very much.

European Central Bank: Press conference - introductory statement Introductory statement by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 2 March 2006. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, let me welcome you to our press conference and report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the ECB’s Governing Council. The meeting was also attended by the President of the Eurogroup, Prime Minister Juncker, and Commissioner Almunia.  At today’s meeting, we decided to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. This decision reflects the upside risks to price stability that we have identified on the basis of both our economic and monetary analyses. The adjustment of interest rates will contribute to ensuring that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum still remain at very low levels in both nominal and real terms, and our monetary policy remains accommodative. While this policy stance reflects our current assessment, we will continue to monitor closely all developments with respect to risks to price stability. Allow me to explain our assessment in greater detail, starting with the economic analysis. According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2005. This was considerably lower than the strong 0.6% recorded in the previous quarter. However, looking through the short-term volatility and assessing recent economic indicators and survey information, the evidence suggests that economic activity is improving. Accordingly, we should see stronger growth rates over the short term, as also reflected in various indicator-based estimates.  Looking further ahead, the conditions remain in place for ongoing economic expansion in the euro area. The external environment remains favourable, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain strong, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring and gains in earnings and business efficiency. Consumption growth should also strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation gradually improves.  The March ECB staff macroeconomic projections have provided an additional input into our analysis of the prospects for economic activity. These projections foresee average annual real GDP growth in a range between 1.7% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.5% and 2.5% in 2007. The results constitute a slight upward revision to the Eurosystem staff projections of December 2005, mainly reflecting a somewhat stronger outlook for private investment over the projection horizon. Most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions give a broadly similar picture. In the view of the Governing Council, downside risks to this outlook for growth relate mainly to oil price developments and global imbalances. Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation was 2.3% in February 2006, compared with 2.4% in January. In the short run, inflation rates are likely to remain at above 2%, with the precise levels depending strongly on future energy price developments, which have recently been relatively volatile. Beyond the short term, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007, and an upward impact can also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases. At the same time, wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over the recent past; our working assumption is that this will continue to be the case, due not least to strong global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Moderate wage trends have helped to contain domestic inflationary pressure despite strong oil price increases. Therefore, looking ahead, it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard, also in the context of a more favourable economic environment. Further input into our assessment of the outlook for price developments is again provided by the March ECB staff projections. Annual HICP inflation is projected to lie between 1.9% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007. Compared with the December 2005 Eurosystem staff projections, these ranges imply a slight upward revision to the profile for HICP inflation over the BIS Review 15/2006 1 
coming years, reflecting mainly an increase in the assumption for future oil prices, in line with market expectations. Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.  Turning to the monetary analysis, the Governing Council has again discussed the assessment of monetary developments in depth. The annual growth rate of M3 remains robust, notwithstanding signs of a resumption of the unwinding of past portfolio shifts into monetary assets, which exerts a dampening effect on headline M3 growth. Looking through the short-term effects generated by such portfolio behaviour, the trend rate of monetary expansion remains strong, reflecting the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates. Moreover, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has strengthened further over recent months, with borrowing by households – especially loans for house purchase – and non-financial corporations rising at a marked pace. Overall, strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area points to risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, and the economic analysis indicates that risks to price stability over the medium term remain on the upside. Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation, cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability prevail. An adjustment of interest rates was therefore warranted. By acting in a timely fashion, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations in line with price stability and thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation. The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise.  As regards fiscal policies, while some countries plan to maintain or attain budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus over the horizon of their stability programmes, progress towards sound public finances in the euro area as a whole remains slow. A number of countries continue to report severe imbalances, and in some of them consolidation efforts barely attain the minimum required by the revised Stability and Growth Pact, despite the improving growth outlook. At the same time, the fiscal costs of population ageing cast a shadow over the long-term fiscal outlook for most euro area countries. It is therefore essential that countries pursue a more determined consolidation, introducing concrete and effective measures where needed. These consolidation efforts will more easily succeed if they are embedded in a comprehensive reform programme that adequately prepares for the long-term fiscal challenges. This will enhance the credibility of the revised Pact and create confidence in a sound and growth-friendly fiscal environment. The broader implications of population ageing also require attention in other fields of economic policy. Comprehensive structural reforms in labour and product markets and the creation of a favourable and competitive environment for firms are vital to support potential growth and raise employment rates as the demographic effects materialise. Completing the EU internal market – including the market for services – should be a key priority. On the labour supply side, tax and benefit system reforms are essential to provide stronger incentives for people to stay in or enter the labour market. On the labour demand side, there is a need to promote wage flexibility and address labour market rigidities. Moreover, better education and training are important for the development of human capital. The forthcoming meeting of the European Council on 23-24 March 2006 will review progress made with the Lisbon strategy, which was relaunched last year. We strongly support the initiatives taken by the European Commission and the European Council to revive this reform process. A full and effective realisation of the necessary reforms is the key to the long-term economic success of the European Union.  We are now at your disposal for questions. 2 BIS Review 15/2006 
Roger W Ferguson, Jr: Economic outlook for the United States Remarks by Mr Roger W Ferguson, Jr, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Howard University Economics Forum, Washington DC, 3 March 2006. *      *      * I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today about the macroeconomic outlook for the U.S. economy. I will discuss both the baseline outlook and some of the risks to that outlook. As always, the views that I will be expressing are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.  Last year was, in some respects, a difficult one for the American people and the economy. As you recall all too well, the hurricanes in the fall inflicted a terrible human toll, in terms of both the number of lives taken and the dislocation of so many people. On the economic side, the storms destroyed residential and business capital along with critical infrastructure and also disrupted economic activity, particularly in the energy and petrochemicals industries and at ports on the Gulf Coast. These effects also contributed to the sharp increase in energy prices that occurred last year. Both the aftermath of the storms and the influence of the higher energy prices are reflected in the slower growth of real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of last year.  Even so, over the course of the year as a whole, real GDP rose a bit more than 3 percent, payroll employment increased significantly, labor productivity posted another solid advance, and the unemployment rate moved down further. Increases in overall consumer prices were boosted by the rise in energy prices, but increases in prices apart from those for food and energy--that is core inflation--remained moderate. In light of the challenges confronting the economy, this was quite a favorable outcome.  Moreover, much of the slowdown in growth last quarter reflected factors that are unlikely to persist. First, as I mentioned, the hurricanes significantly damped economic activity in the Gulf Coast region and led to a sharp increase in energy-related imports. Although the recovery of economic activity in the worst-affected areas will take a long time, many of the affected industries, including those in the energy sector, have made considerable progress toward returning their production to normal levels. Second, much of the weakness in consumer spending came from a sharp drop in motor vehicle sales after the end of last summer's employee pricing programs. Third, defense spending, which can be volatile from quarter to quarter, dropped sharply in the fourth quarter. The unwinding of these factors should provide some support to growth of real activity in the near term.  Indeed, the most recent data suggest that economic activity in 2006 is off to a solid start. Payroll employment expanded briskly in January--the latest month for which figures are available--on top of sizable gains over the preceding two months. Although these increases contain some bounceback from the effects of the hurricanes, they also likely reflect underlying strength in labor demand--an impression that is corroborated by the recent low readings on initial claims for unemployment insurance. In addition, the underlying pace of activity in the industrial sector has been quite robust recently. Real household spending continued to climb in January; although unseasonably warm weather that month left an imprint on the data, the result suggests some underlying strength in this sector. Housing activity has, on balance, been a bit softer recently but still remains at a high level.  Overall, the fundamentals appear sufficient to support continued economic expansion. Underlying productivity growth remains strong, the financial positions of households and businesses remain conducive to spending, and, if we have no further run-up in oil prices, the drag on activity from higher energy prices should diminish over time. And the outlook for activity abroad is quite favorable. In Japan, the expansion appears to be broadening, and signs suggest that the Japanese financial sector may finally be stabilizing. Prospects in Europe are gradually improving, particularly in Germany, after several years of sluggish growth. Many emerging market economies also are doing well, with exports providing a significant boost to activity in these countries. These developments should provide some ongoing support to the U.S. economy.  BIS Review 15/2006 1 
The inflation outlook The continued surge in energy prices was the dominant factor affecting inflation last year. Rising energy prices contribute to consumer inflation in several ways--by boosting prices for gasoline and other energy goods; by raising the price of non-energy goods and services as firms pass on increased energy costs; and by putting upward pressure on expectations of future inflation. Despite those pressures, core inflation has, as I mentioned, remained contained, a result likely attributable to a range of causes.  The decline in the economy's energy intensity is one of the factors that has restrained the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation in recent decades. As energy prices started to rise in the 1970s, households responded by purchasing products that were more energy efficient and adjusting their consumption habits in other ways. Businesses responded by designing and purchasing capital goods that were more energy efficient and by redesigning production processes in ways that used less energy. One measure of these changes in energy intensity is the ratio of energy use to real GDP, which has fallen more than half since the mid-1970s.  Econometric evidence suggests, however, that the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation has dropped by more than would be implied by the decline in energy intensity. In particular, we often look at forecasting equations for core inflation that include a term for the price of energy, weighted by a measure of energy intensity. Using data for years preceding 1981, the pass-through of energy prices to core prices is large and statistically significant. In the period since 1981, the evidence of pass-through of energy prices to core inflation is more limited. Because the energy-price term in these models already controls for the decline in energy intensity, this result suggests that other factors also are restraining the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation.  Although many factors could have led to these results, a likely explanation is that inflation expectations have become better anchored. In the 1970s, monetary policy unfortunately allowed large increases in energy prices to have a persistent effect on inflation, a policy that undercut the Fed's credibility and caused long-run inflation expectations to be more volatile. Since that time, however, the Federal Reserve has been more aggressive in fighting all sources of inflationary pressures, including energy price changes. This effort appears to have paid off not only in low and stable inflation but also in a reduction in the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to energy prices. The reduced sensitivity is evidenced by how little movement has appeared in survey measures in response to the rise in energy prices over the past two years.  This same tendency can be seen in longer-horizon measures of inflation compensation derived from a comparison of yields on nominal Treasury securities and those on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), which are indexed to a measure of price change. Specifically, for the period five to ten years ahead, the TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation has remained well anchored in recent quarters. Moreover, econometric evidence suggests that since early 2004, energy prices have had only a modest effect on TIPS-based inflation compensation at relatively longer horizons. Because inflation-indexed securities were not issued in the 1970s and early 1980s, we cannot know for sure how these recent effects differ from those that might have operated earlier, but I believe that the difference would be stark.  All told, increases in energy prices over the past couple of years probably added about 1/2 percentage point to core inflation in 2005, and the lagged pass-through of past increases in energy prices appears likely to add roughly the same amount this year, provided that energy prices do not rise significantly further.  The term structure of interest rates Another development that has received considerable attention recently is the term structure of interest rates--the yield curve. Typically, longer-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates, so a curve plotting yields would rise as maturity lengthens. However, since late last fall, yields on longer maturities have been equal to or less than those at some shorter maturities, creating a flat to inverted yield curve. Going back to the 1950s, a simple picture suggests that the yield curve tends to invert before recessions. In addition, some academic research, along with recent market commentary, suggests that the shape of the yield curve is a strong predictor of future economic growth.  However, the Treasury yield curve is now only slightly inverted between one and five years and is roughly flat beyond that. Moreover, yield curves can be flat or inverted either because short-term 2 BIS Review 15/2006 
interest yields are relatively high or because long-term rates are relatively low. Historically, flat or inverted yield curves owing to unusually high short-term rates have tended to be followed by slowdowns, but that has not been the case for those episodes of inverted yield curves owing to relatively low long-term rates. And, in the current situation, the flatness of the term structure results largely from relatively low long-term yields.  In addition, the relationship between the yield curve and future economic growth may have weakened in recent decades because the decline in inflation, the dropoff in the variance of economic growth since the mid-1980s, and financial innovation may have altered the sensitivity of households and businesses to changes in rates. Indeed, in simple regression models estimated with recent data, a change in the slope of the term structure has a smaller effect on economic growth than when the models are estimated with data taken from a longer sample period. And models using the more recent data anticipate more rapid real GDP growth in coming quarters than do models using the longer sample period.  The relationship between the yield curve and future growth also appears to depend on the factors that are keeping long-term rates low. Long-term interest rates embody both expectations of future interest rates as well as the amount of compensation demanded by investors for the risk of unanticipated movements in real interest rates and inflation--that is, the term premium. By historical standards, the term premium appears to have come down significantly in recent years and to be quite low. A flat yield curve resulting from low term premiums should have quite different implications for future growth than would a flat yield curve resulting from tight monetary policy. Indeed, an exogenous decline in term premiums would make financial conditions more accommodative and would, other things being equal, be followed by higher growth. To account for these developments, an estimate of the term premium can be added to a simple regression model of the relationship between real GDP growth and the slope of the yield curve. Forecasts of future real GDP growth from this extended model are higher than those from models that include only the slope of the yield curve. And the forecasts from this extended model currently are very close to the private-sector consensus forecast.  Thus, we have reasons to believe that the current configuration of the term structure is not signaling an economic downturn. At the same time, the amount of economic stimulus arising from low long-term rates is probably not especially large. Indeed, low long-term rates may be signaling relatively low demand for capital around the world relative to saving, which in turn may reflect a lack of sufficiently attractive investment opportunities. For example, in the United States, the nominal share of business fixed investment in GDP has risen recently only to about its long-run average--a level arguably somewhat lower than might be expected given the low level of long-term interest rates. Because interest rates equilibrate the supply and demand of capital, an excess of desired saving relative to desired investment would tend, all else equal, to hold down long-term rates. In turn, low rates have stimulated activity in areas outside of business investment: Housing has been boosted significantly, and consumer spending may also have received some additional impetus.  Some risks to the outlook All told, the U.S. economic expansion appears to be solidly on track. Nevertheless, the outlook for real activity faces a number of significant risks, including the possibility that house prices and construction could retrench sharply and that energy prices could rise significantly further.  Housing construction has been a significant source of strength in this expansion, and consequently, some analysts have suggested that a correction in this sector could take a big bite out of growth. By my reading, the incoming data suggest that the housing market has begun to cool somewhat, but they do not point to a sharper falloff. Sales of both new and existing homes have declined in recent months, although they remain at a high level; and after cutting though volatility likely related to swings in weather, housing starts appear to have softened recently. Moreover, other indicators of activity, along with anecdotal reports, also seem consistent with an easing, but not with a sharp downward correction.  Of course, house prices may become an area of vulnerability. House prices have increased at a remarkable rate during the past several years, and for some fundamentally sound reasons, including low mortgage rates. However, the possibility remains that the recent run-up in prices may be greater than can be justified by the fundamentals and that increases in house prices may moderate or undergo a sharper adjustment. The latest data on house prices--including the figures released this BIS Review 15/2006 3 
week--provide a hint that a moderation in house prices, and nothing more serious, may now be under way.  The primary channel through which a deceleration or downturn in housing prices would be likely to affect the economy is the so-called wealth effect. That is, the path of house prices directly affects the value of housing wealth, and changes in wealth influence households' consumption and saving. Estimates from the Federal Reserve Board staff's large econometric model and from various consumption equations suggest that wealth effects are somewhere in the neighborhood of 3-1/2 cents on consumption for every dollar of change in wealth, with roughly half the effect realized within a year.  However, these estimates are uncertain, and plausible estimates of the wealth effect range from about 2 cents to 6 cents for every dollar of change in wealth. Moreover, these estimates are obtained from equations that look at changes in total wealth, whereas historically, much of the variation in wealth has reflected movements in equity prices. Although efforts have been made to isolate the effects of changes in different types of wealth, it is difficult to get precise estimates of wealth effects specifically for real estate. And, it is always possible that the effects of housing wealth on consumption might have changed in ways that would be hard to identify using standard econometric modeling techniques. For example, the effects could, perhaps, have increased in the last decade as a wave of financial innovation made it easier and less costly for households to tap accumulated housing equity.  A decline in consumer confidence is another channel through which a correction in house prices could affect the economy. In the current situation, a sizable deceleration in house prices could have an outsized effect on consumer confidence and thereby reduce household spending by more than is implied by conventional estimates of the wealth effect.  Another possible avenue for gauging the effects of housing prices on the economy is to look at experiences in other countries. House prices have risen markedly in recent years in many industrial countries amid low long-term interest rates, ample liquidity, and steady economic growth. Although movements in real house prices flattened out or turned down in several countries in the first half of 2005, they have since recovered for the most part. Of the countries that have seen recent booms in house prices, Australia has experienced a decline in real house prices over the past year; real prices are down about 3 percent since their peak at the end of 2003. During this period, residential investment contracted, and the growth of real consumption slowed a bit; but the economy continued to grow, in part because investment in other sectors picked up in response to strong global demand.  More countries have experienced a slowdown in rates of increase in home prices than experienced an outright decline. For example, in the Netherlands--where residential property prices rose particularly rapidly in the late 1990s--the rate of increase slowed significantly beginning in 2000. In 2002 and 2003, the economy experienced a mild recession, with domestic demand contracting as a result of declines in investment (including residential investment) and contracting consumption. But, even so, the economy started to recover in 2004 and 2005, and house prices there have continued to rise in recent years.  In the United Kingdom, house prices also flattened out last year, and this deceleration was accompanied by a slowdown in real consumption growth. More recently, house prices have started rising again, and consumption growth has also picked up.  The experiences in Australia and the United Kingdom could be taken as suggesting that adjustments in house prices can be associated, on balance, with continued modest economic growth, while the Dutch experience paints a slightly more pessimistic picture. Having said that, one difficulty in interpreting the foreign evidence is that gauging the direction of causality is difficult--that is, are adjustments in house prices causing a slowdown in real economic growth or is a slowdown in activity causing the adjustment in house prices. On this point, a recent Federal Reserve study of international experience documented the pro-cyclicality of real house prices: House prices have tended to reach a maximum near business cycle peaks, with real GDP growth slowing during the first year or so after house prices peak.1                                                        1  Alan G. Ahearne, John Ammer, Brian M. Doyle, Linda S. Kole, and Robert F. Martin (2005), "House Prices and Monetary Policy: A Cross-Country Study," International Finance Discussion Papers 2005-841 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September). 4 BIS Review 15/2006 
Given the limits of what we know about the future path of housing prices and about the implications of any particular house-price scenario for real activity, the Federal Reserve will have to continue monitoring this area closely.  Further increases in energy prices are another risk to the economic outlook. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from around $30 per barrel in December 2002 to around $65 per barrel in mid-August 2005, shortly before Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall. Since the storms hit, prices have fluctuated widely in response to developments in both domestic and foreign oil markets and recently stood a bit below pre-Katrina levels. Over the same time period, prices of far-dated futures contracts have also risen a substantial amount. As oil prices have pushed higher since late 2003, prices of natural gas also have trended up sharply. And storm-related disruptions to natural gas production as well as weather patterns this winter have caused considerable volatility in natural gas prices.  Economic theory suggests that energy price hikes of this magnitude should have an important contractionary effect on the economy by reducing the purchasing power of households and holding down business profits outside the energy sector. Persistently higher oil prices also likely reduce labor productivity and potential output over time as firms adjust their production processes to use less energy. As for the reduction in aggregate demand, higher energy prices increase the bill for imported oil and natural gas, which can be viewed as a "tax" on U.S. residents by foreign energy producers, thereby holding down aggregate demand. Given the rise in energy prices since 2003, the import "tax" has risen more than $150 billion annually. Although they are imprecise, simulations from the Federal Reserve Board staff's large-scale econometric model, which account for these effects, suggest that increases in spot and futures prices of energy from late 2003 to the present subtracted a 1/2 percentage point from real GDP growth in 2004 and more than 1 percentage point in 2005. The model suggests the subtraction this year will be about a 1/2 percentage point.  In addition to their effect on economic activity, further increases in energy prices also pose a risk to the inflation outlook. Looking ahead, the path of far-dated futures prices for oil indicates that markets are not expecting prices to rise significantly further. However, given strong global demand for energy resources and the ever-present risk of supply disruptions, additional increases in energy prices cannot be ruled out. Such increases would boost the overall inflation rate and might put additional upward pressure on production costs and inflation expectations, which in turn, could create forces that would tend to push core inflation up. If that were to occur, the Fed would need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that inflation remained under control.  Where do we go from here? As you know, the Federal Reserve seeks to foster price stability and to promote sustainable growth in output, and the members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are committed to achieving these objectives. Translating these general economic objectives into operational decisions about monetary policy poses many challenges, and no simple toolkit of economic and financial indicators or economic models can provide reliable guidance at all times. Rather, the FOMC must assess the implications of a wide range of developments and data as well as rely on the best modeling that the economics profession can provide.  In the current situation, the economic expansion appears to be on track and core inflation has remained moderate. As I indicated, significant risks, if realized, could alter this generally sanguine outlook, and the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments closely. Given the considerable uncertainties facing the economy and the outlook for policy, policy decisions in coming months will depend heavily on the implications of incoming economic data for future growth and inflation.

Jean-Pierre Roth: Heading for more sustained growth? Summary of an address by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the General Meeting of the Swiss Italian Chamber of Commerce, Zurich, 20 June 2006. The complete speech can be found in French on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Lately, Switzerland has been experiencing an encouraging upturn in the economy on the back of growth in the international economy. This development is particularly welcome because it follows a number of years of economic listlessness which have prompted repeated criticism from international bodies, due to the lack of growth in the Swiss economy.  However, Switzerland's medium and long-term growth problem has not disappeared. Faster economic growth is the only possible response to the challenges posed by an ageing population. Moreover, it is the sole antidote to Switzerland's continuing loss of ground with respect to the other members of the OECD. Reforms are needed to ensure that, in the future, we can achieve more with fewer resources. The ways and means of doing this are evident. The Federal Council's package of growth measures is a move in the right direction, and the current improvement in the economy gives Switzerland the opportunity to move ahead with the requisite reforms.

David Dodge: Global economic forces and the need for adjustment Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Chambre de commerce du Montréal métropolitain and the Fédération des chambres de commerce du Québec, Montréal, Quebec, 21 June 2006. *      *      * Since the start of the millennium, developments in the global economy have led to important changes throughout the Canadian economy and to serious challenges for many sectors and regions. Because nobody can anticipate precisely how the world will unfold, the best we can do is to ensure that our economy is as flexible as possible. What I want to do today is look briefly at how the Canadian economy has adjusted so far and talk about what public policies - including monetary policy - can do to promote economic flexibility.  Let me start by listing the main global developments since 2000. First, China and India have emerged as economic powerhouses. Second, global economic growth has been extraordinarily strong. Third, we have gone through a period marked by an unusually high amount of monetary stimulus, which central banks are now in the process of reducing. At the same time, we have seen a persistent and growing current account deficit in the United States, mirrored by large and growing current account surpluses elsewhere, especially in Asia and among many oil-exporting countries. These developments have had significant consequences for the Canadian economy. The strong global growth, especially in China, India, and the United States, has led to sharply higher prices for many of the primary commodities that Canada produces. The emergence of China and India has also led to intense competition for many manufacturers, as well as lower prices for various consumer durable and semi-durable goods. The higher prices for many of our exports, coupled with lower prices for imported goods, have led to an improvement in our terms of trade and rising incomes for Canadians - particularly for producers of commodities, including metals and energy products. In this environment, we have seen a rapid increase in the external value of the Canadian dollar.  It is clear that we must all adjust to these developments and be ready to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the strong global economy. Of course, adjustment is easier said than done. And it is important to acknowledge that adjustment is often very difficult on a personal level. The adjustments over the past three years have been particularly difficult because of the speed and size of the movements in relative prices. This has been a double-edged sword. On the one hand, some firms are facing booming demand and have been unable to expand quickly enough, hindered by shortages of skilled labour, outdated machinery, and inadequate infrastructure. On the other hand, some firms have struggled to increase the value-added of the goods they produce in Canada in the face of falling prices and global competition. They have had to find ways to shift some activities offshore. This second type of difficulty has been more prevalent in traditional goods-producing industries such as clothing, textiles, and newsprint. In some cases, business owners and employees - who have invested decades of their lives in a particular firm or industry - are coming to terms with plant closures and the loss of jobs. None of this is easy. These difficulties have been plain to see in media reports and in official economic data. However, these same data also show increases in output in sectors such as wholesale trade and financial and business services, as well as manufacturing sectors such as pharmaceuticals and transportation equipment. Despite all the challenges, we are seeing businesses across the country being inventive in responding to the necessity of adjustment. We have been tracking this adjustment through our regular communications with business groups, manufacturers, and exporters, as well as through the Bank's Business Outlook Surveys. These surveys, conducted by staff in the Bank's regional offices, are available on our website, and I encourage you to look at them. Since 2003, when the Canadian dollar began to appreciate, they have told an encouraging story of how businesses have found ways to innovate and adjust to changing circumstances. The role of public policies But what role is there for public policies in this adjustment process? Above all, governments should not try to shield business from global forces, nor should they interfere with market signals. Which policies BIS Review 59/2006 1 
then can support market-based adjustment? At the macroeconomic level, monetary and fiscal policies can facilitate adjustment by promoting stable and sustainable long-term economic growth. I'll have more to say about the role of monetary policy in a moment. On the microeconomic side, let me mention a few areas where governments can act. The first has to do with infrastructure, and there are really two sides to that - human and physical. In terms of human infrastructure, there is a crucial role for government in promoting education and training. Ultimately, the strength of our economy depends on the skills of its workforce. Obviously, governments should make sure that everyone has the opportunity to receive a sound, basic education. And in the face of shortages of skilled labour, public policies should encourage the training and retraining of employees, so that they can move more easily into sectors that are expanding. But I would not stop there. There is much that we as employers can do to give our employees the opportunity to improve and develop their skills.  In terms of physical infrastructure, public policies can support both public and private investment so that firms can become more productive. By infrastructure, I am referring not only to traditional projects such as roads, bridges, and pipelines, but also to assets such as the so-called "information superhighway." Having modern, reliable infrastructure in place allows businesses to invest with greater certainty, thus furthering the adjustment process. This may mean the use of private funds to develop public infrastructure projects, as I have mentioned in past speeches. And now is the time to encourage this type of investment, given our climate of low nominal interest rates, and the presence of large pension funds that are searching for these kinds of investment opportunities. The second area where governments can act has to do with policies to promote economic flexibility. Governments must see to it that rules and regulations are not hindering that flexibility. In terms of labour markets, we need to recognize that supporting workers does not mean propping up factories or industries that cannot compete in the global economy. Rather, it means removing barriers so that workers can make adjustments as easily and painlessly as possible. Rules and regulations should not prevent workers from shifting from sector to sector, province to province, or even region to region within a province. Too often, labour mobility is hindered because credentials are not recognized from one province to another. All of these barriers to labour mobility are unhelpful, not just to the economy, but to the workers themselves. The focus for policy must be how to encourage and support the mobility of our workforce. Third, we need policies that allow Canadian capital markets to work at peak efficiency. This will also provide business with flexibility to help them invest and expand, and so support the adjustment process. As I have said before, we need policies that do not impede efficiency in our financial institutions and markets, and at the same time encourage competition. This is crucial, not only because it allows firms to have appropriate access to capital, but also because financial services is a high value-added industry that makes a large contribution to employment and income, particularly here in Montréal. Those are three of the most important microeconomic policy considerations for the public sector in terms of supporting economic adjustment. On the macroeconomic side, governments should continue to aim for sustainable fiscal policies, with budgets in rough balance or in small surplus. But I want to spend a few minutes speaking about monetary policy and the role of the Bank of Canada. The Bank of Canada's monetary policy aims to preserve a climate of low, stable, and predictable inflation. This can help with the adjustment process in several ways. Such a climate minimizes the distortion of price signals that can lead to inappropriate investment choices. Low and stable inflation allows firms to undertake long-term investments with greater certainty. But crucially, low inflation also reduces the risk premium demanded by investors. This means that nominal long-term interest rates are kept low, which supports the investment that helps with the adjustment process.  In addition, the Bank's monetary policy has a stabilizing function, which also facilitates adjustment. Let me explain. We keep inflation in check by trying to have the economy operate at full capacity, with aggregate supply and demand in balance. In doing so, we help the adjustment process because resources that are released by sectors under pressure can be more readily absorbed by sectors that are expanding. We see clear evidence of this process happening right now in Canada. Let me now say a few words about how our flexible exchange rate fits into our monetary policy framework. There are some who have called on the Bank to smooth out fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, or to slow its ascent. But we have one monetary policy instrument - our influence over interest rates - so we can have only one target. Canada has chosen low inflation as the target, because 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
experience clearly shows that low inflation is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic health. We do not have a target for the Canadian dollar. However, this does not mean that the Bank does not care about the impact of movements in the exchange rate on the Canadian economy. The truth is quite the opposite - the exchange rate plays an important role in our monetary policy deliberations. Exchange rate movements tell us something about economic developments that may be having a direct impact on the demand for Canadian goods and services. And the movements themselves have their own effect on aggregate demand, by changing relative prices and by shifting demand between domestic- and foreign-produced products. The challenge for the Bank is to evaluate these movements, together with other data, and to set a course for monetary policy that works to keep demand and supply in balance and inflation low and stable. In making this evaluation, we try to determine how much of a particular movement in the Canadian dollar is due to changes in world demand for our goods and services, and how much is due to other factors unrelated to the demand for Canadian goods and services. It is important that we understand the causes of exchange rate movements, because the implications for the economy, and the appropriate monetary policy response, depend on the cause of the change. Generally speaking, movements related to changes in demand for our goods and services would require little, if any, monetary policy response. This is because their impact on Canadian aggregate demand would serve to offset the initial direct changes in global demand for our goods and services. And this would help to keep overall supply and demand in balance. So what can we say about the appreciation of the Canadian dollar? Since 2003, most of the appreciation - but not all - appears to have been related to our improved terms of trade and the increased demand for Canadian goods and services. Some of the appreciation has also reflected the broad-based weakness of the U.S. dollar associated with global current account imbalances. My colleague, Tiff Macklem, spoke on this topic at some length a couple of weeks ago, and you can find his remarks on our website. Determining how much of each of these forces is behind the movement in the currency is an important, but very difficult, judgment that the Bank must make. This judgment is even more difficult during times of market volatility, such as we have seen since the Bank's last fixed announcement date on 24 May. During that time, a number of Canadian economic indicators have also been published. Some of these indicators have been stronger than expected, others have been weaker. But on balance, the projection we set out in our April Monetary Policy Report appears to be reasonable. That is to say, we continue to expect economic growth roughly in line with the growth of potential output, and inflation to average close to the 2 per cent target in 2007 and 2008, excluding any temporary effects on inflation that will follow the forthcoming reduction in the Goods and Services Tax.  As we said at our last fixed announcement date, we will continue to monitor all economic and financial developments in the global and domestic economies relative to the projection in the April Report. But it is important to remember that when it comes to setting monetary policy, the Bank always tries to develop a complete picture of the economy. We do not react unduly to any individual piece of information. Rather, we put all the pieces together to get to the underlying trends in the economy. And, as always, we will look at the complete economic picture as we lead up to our next decision date on 11 July, and we will present that complete picture in our Monetary Policy Report Update two days later. Conclusion Let me conclude. Powerful global economic forces have been affecting the Canadian economy and will continue to have an impact for the foreseeable future. Adjustment must take place. It hasn't been easy, and it hasn't been without pain. And adjustment won't be easy in the months and years ahead. But I'm encouraged to see that most firms are getting on with the job. I encourage you to persevere with these adjustments. For our part, we remain committed to keeping inflation low, stable, and predictable. That is the best contribution we can make to helping output and employment remain strong. BIS Review 59/2006 3 
Hamad Al-Sayari: World class banking sector Speech by His Excellency Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, during “The Future Building" Seminar, in cooperation with Euromoney, Riyadh, 9-10 May 2006.  *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen,  It is a great pleasure for me to participate in this Symposium and share with my insights on “The Development of Banking Sector” in Saudi Arabia and have a glance over its development and role in supporting the growth of the Saudi economy to be more dynamic and attractive to domestic and foreign investments.  At first, let me briefly cover the achievements of the Saudi banking sector since the establishment of SAMA in 1952. According to SAMA’s Charter, two of its most important objectives are to issue and strengthen the Saudi currency and stabilize its internal and external value, and to regulate commercial banks. On the basis of a historic review, we may judge how far these objectives have been achieved. The exchange rate has fluctuated in a very narrow band over the past six decades. This has contributed to attaining the ultimate goal of our monetary policy of achieving price stability. The inflation rate has remained very low and has generally remained, on average, below 1% per annum over the past 20 years.  These stable conditions have contributed strongly to sustained growth in the overall economy with average real GDP growth of 3.2% per annum for the last decade. Over these decades, the economic environment has been characterized by freedom of capital flows, open investment climate, low inflation, stable financial system and availability of ample liquidity. This has encouraged the rise in both domestic and foreign investment in the country. Particularly in the past two decades, the growth has been rapid in the non-oil private sector which has almost doubled and now represents over 44% of the annual GDP, while the percentage contribution of the oil sector has declined to around 33%.  As for SAMA’s other major objective of supervising and regulating the financial system, SAMA has followed prudent policies aimed at creating a sound, stable, solid and efficient financial system with a modern payments system. SAMA’s Charter and the Banking Control Law give it broad regulatory powers to ensure that banks are adequately capitalized, having efficient managements, run by fit and proper Directors and Managers who meet competence and integrity requirements, and that the banks have fit and appropriate operation and control systems.  Over this long period, prudent supervisory policies and timely action have ensured that banks stayed strong and solid. This is a remarkable achievement in the face of global and regional economic uncertainties, political crisis, wars and volatilities of the oil market. Today, Saudi banks play a leading role in the financial system that also includes five large specialized government development financing institutions and leasing, investment and insurance companies and a few money changers. Saudi banks have benefited greatly from the Universal Banking Model permitted by SAMA and offer a range of financial services including investment management, mutual funds, brokerage, and other services. During the past decade, the volume of business of Saudi banks has grown at a phenomenal rate. In the ten years period 1996-2005, the banks’ assets grew by 213 per cent, deposits by 224 per cent and capital and reserves by 248 per cent. During this period the profits for the banking system showed strong growth and the return on equity averaged well over 20% and return on assets was over 2%. The strength of Saudi banks is further underlined by their average risk-based capital adequacy, which has been high according to Basel capital adequacy standard, and averaged 18% during the past decade.  If we review our long history of foreign investment in the financial sector since early 1950, a number of foreign banks were granted licenses to open branches in the Kingdom. In 1976, there were 12 banks in the Kingdom including 10 foreign banks. To Saudize the banking system and benefit from foreign expertise of the banks operating in the Kingdom, the government invited foreign banks to convert their branches into Saudi-foreign joint stock companies with an equity share of 40% for the foreign partner. Technical Management Agreements were also entered into to manage the new banks by the foreign partners. Consequently, Saudi banking companies were established and became integrated with the global banking system, benefiting from its expertise and training capabilities, and coped with its BIS Review 59/2006 1 
developments. Eventually, the Saudi banks compare well with their counterparts in advanced countries.  During the 1990s, no new bank licenses were issued. However the year 2000 ushered in a new era of openness when a license was granted to the Gulf International Bank, a Bahraini bank, owned by the GCC countries. This was to implement a decision made by the GCC Heads of States to permit qualifying GCC-owned banks in their home markets. This has been followed by new licenses to 4 more GCC-owned banks, (namely the Emirates Bank International, the National Bank of Kuwait, the National Bank of Bahrain and the Bank Muscat). Licenses were also granted to five other major international and emerging market banks (that include BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, State Bank of India and National Bank of Pakistan). Just during this past week Deutsche Bank has opened its branch in Riyadh and National Bank of Kuwait in Jeddah. The remaining banks are in the process of opening their branches in 2006. On 27/2/1427H, a Royal Decree was issued approving the incorporation of a joint-stock company under the name "the Development Bank", with a capital of Rls 15.0 billion. This would enhance competition and open new horizons for diversified banking services.  In view of the importance of payments and settlements systems for the efficiency and security of the banking system, these have been developed by using state-of-the-art electronic technologies and highly sophisticated and technically advanced information systems that not only meet, but often exceed, international standards. The transformation started in 1986 when SAMA installed the Automatic Cheque Clearing System. In 1989, SAMA required all Saudi banks to join the Saudi Payments Network (SPAN) which is a national ATM system. This system was subsequently extended to a point-of-sale that links customers, merchants and banks. However, the backbone of the Saudi Payment and Settlement System is the Saudi Riyal Interbank Express (SARIE). This is an interbank system that operates on Real Time Gross Settlement basis. SARIE provides an electronic link between all other payments and clearing systems which had been installed earlier. A follower of the statistical data on the payments systems, issued by SAMA, would realize the huge growth achieved in the number of ATMs, POS and transactions executed through them in addition to the transactions carried out through SAREA' System.  Of course, Saudi banks and their customers have benefited greatly from these advances in technology. Banks have been able to expand their businesses by offering a range of new products, control their costs and to enhance profitability. Consumers have benefited from access to a broader range of services and from reduction in costs. Telephone and internet banking is now rapidly expanding, and in 2006, the Saudi Payment System is well poised for further enhancement by SADDAD which provides the ability to pay major companies' bills electronically by debiting the accounts of their customers. This will further enhance efficiency and reduce costs.  Currently, SAMA, in cooperation with the banks, is working to upgrade and streamline the Saudi Payments Network to permit the continued expansion in the installation of ATMs and POS. so that it could provide more advanced banking services with high confidentiality and full security. SAMA is also in the process of upgrading the Cheque Clearing System to carry out transactions electronically and in real time. This is in to meet present and future expansion requirements of the growth of the capital market and to promote customer services and to provide same through electronic channels in a way that will cope with the large expansion in the growth of the domestic economy.  During the past decade there has been prominent diversification in the banking business which included the following:  1.  Banks were able to meet the increasing demand by the different categories of customers for various modern banking services. This made banking services provided in the domestic market compete well with their counterparts in developed countries. But in the past year there occurred subsequent developments leading to a substantial demand for banking services that included payment of salaries, payment of public utilities bills and fees through banks, more subscription to public offering of companies' shares, increase of demand on share trading, as well as enforcement of some security controls required as measures for protecting the banking system against money laundering operations. All this occurred in a very short period, leading to rising complaints of inefficient services provided by some bank branches. Banks managed and they are still working to overcome such shortcomings by employing and training more staff, opening new branches, and providing alternative channels to perform banking services, with employment rising during twelve months by 20%.  2.  Banks have made significant strides in provision of asset management services such as investment portfolio accounts, mutual investment funds aimed at domestic, regional and 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
international shares and bonds markets, money market instruments and real estate investment. Assets under management increased 8 times from Rls 17 billion to Rls 132 billion during the period 1996-2005.  3. Since 1998, consumer loans have increased dramatically. This can be largely attributed to the SARIE system which permits loans to be secured by salary assignments. These loans have provided access to banking system liquidity to a large segment of customers to meet their consumer and investment needs, thereby, supporting the pace of economic activity.  4. Another important development has been the rapid growth in the provision of Islamic Shariah compliant services to cater to the increasing demand by customers for such services. All Saudi banks offer a range of Islamic products including Murabaha, Mudaraba, Musharaka, Baie Ajel, etc.  The significant growth, diversification and profitability of the Saudi banking system has been underpinned by a strong and and advanced regulatory system. Over the past two decades SAMA has introduced many modern supervisory standards compliant with international standards including risk based capital adequacy, liquidity, large exposures, risk management and others. In the past two years alone, SAMA has developed regulations relating to market risk, loan classification and provisioning, controls of consumer lending and updated the requirements for appointment in senior posts of banks.  On the corporate governance front there is a heightened awareness in the world with standards emanating from OECD, Basle Committee and others. SAMA has been since the early 1980s inculcating these concepts in the Saudi Banks. In 1981, it issued a guidance document to the Directors of Saudi Banks defining the general framework of their roles and responsibilities. This was followed by regulations on Internal Controls in 1989, Prevention of Fraud (1994), Prevention of Money Laundering (1995) and the Role of the Audit Committee (1996). Furthermore, SAMA has promoted proper accounting standards to be followed by the Saudi banks in order to ensure more transparency in their financial statements. Saudi Arabia was among the first countries in 1992 to adopt the International Financial Reporting Standards by the Banking Industry.  Another important subject relevant to banking supervision is the Basle II Capital Adequacy Accord. SAMA has previously implemented the First Basle Capital Accord in 1992. Accordingly, Saudi banks have maintained high capital adequacy ratios of more than 18% throughout the period from 1992 to 2005. Also it is worth noting that 90% of the capital is of the tier-1 quality. Currently, banks are working closely with SAMA in the implementation of the Basle II Capital Accord. We expect all banks operating in Saudi Arabia to implement the standardized approach for credit risk by 1 January 2008 and then continue to move towards more sophisticated Internal Rating Based approaches. For operational risk all banks are likely to move to standardized approach with one or two banks experimenting with the Advanced Management approaches. SAMA is also encouraging banks to consider a National Data Pooling initiative to help them in credit risk management. All in all Saudi banking system is well on its way to the implementation of Basel II and we expect that banks will remain highly capitalized under the new standard. It is worth mentioning that SAMA's approach in applying Basel (II) Accord is an integrated one aimed at raising the level of risk management in order to maintain the continued strength of the banking system.  One of the issues that has preoccupied the supervisors of the banking system and security organs is combating money laundering and financing of terrorism. Over the past years a number of steps have been taken including:  • In 1990, the Kingdom ratified the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances.  • In 1995, SAMA issued a manual containing “Guidelines for Prevention and Control of Money Laundering Activities”. These required Saudi banks to implement “Know Your Customer” rules, maintain records of suspicious transactions and report any suspicious activities to law enforcement agencies and SAMA.  • In 2003, SAMA issued revised AML-CTF Rules that updated previous requirements and provided a comprehensive framework for KYC requirements, according to the 40+8 FATF Recommendations and the Basel Recommendations. These Rules provide for strong sanctions to be imposed on banks and individuals that fail to implement these requirements.  BIS Review 59/2006 3 
• In August 2003, the Council of Ministers approved a Law for Combating Money Laundering. Subsequently, a Financial Intelligence Unit was created in the Ministry of Interior and was staffed with expert resources.  • Also in 2004, the Financial Action Task Force carried out a review of the implementation of its 40 plus its 8 special recommendations. This review indicated that Saudi Arabia was fully or largely compliant with almost all FATF recommendations.  • Finally, in 2005 Saudi Arabia became a member of FATF Regional Body for Middle East and North Africa (MENAFATF) and a Saudi official from SAMA was elected and appointed as the Executive Secretary of this regional body.  Finally, another important supervisory development has been the adoption, in 2004, of a risk based supervisory approach by SAMA. This has significantly strengthened and made more efficient the on-site and off-site supervision practiced by SAMA. This approach is proactive and requires enhanced and frequent communication with banks at all levels. It brings SAMA supervision fully in line with the new international standards.  In recent years, the strength of the Saudi banking system and SAMA’s sound banking supervision practices have been recognized by a number of important international institutions. One of the findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program by an IMF/WB Team in 2005 indicated that the SAMA Banking Supervision, fully or largely met the 25 Basle Core Principles. On the other hand, external rating agencies including S&P, Fitch and Capital Intelligence in 2004 and 2005 have issued favourable reports on the Saudi Banking system. The recent external rating upgrade by S&P to A+ reflects the inherent strength of the domestic banking system.  The developments of the banking sector have been reflected positively on the performance of the Saudi economy. Over the preceding three years, GDP (at current prices) have increased by an annual average growth rate of 18.1%, and private sector GDP by 6.7%. Money supply has grown by an annual average rate of 12.9%, providing adequate liquidity to growth requirements of the economy.  Looking ahead, the financial system and the banking sector will benefit from the state’s efforts to diversify the economy and improve the investment environment through regulatory and structural measures taken in the various sectors. A number of new laws and regulatory guidelines have been enacted to enhance economic growth and achieve further opening of domestic markets. The laws included the Foreign Investment Law, the Capital Market and Cooperative Insurance Laws and a new Labour Law. Another important development is the Kingdom's accession to WTO.  Turning to the Capital Market, its contribution to the growth of the Saudi economy has been clearly evident. Over the preceding few years, the market has witnessed remarkable development, and its role as a financial intermediary between savors and investors has been boosted. It would be appropriate to indicate that the recent market correction witnessed by the market has had no adverse consequences on the banks and banking system. This is because SAMA, through its supervisory functions, has undertaken measures necessary for safeguarding banks and customers against any unfavorable developments in the market. The measures included tightening prudential limits related to lending for trading in the market, issuing controls for consumer loans and other measures which would protect customers and banks against expansion in consumer loans which may end with trading in the equity market. Consequently, Saudi Banks have managed to do well in the first quarter of 2006. As the shares market stabilizes and continued good performance by banks is maintained, it is expected that the financial system will greatly benefit from the efforts of the authorities to deepen and broaden the capital market. Now let me briefly touch upon the opportunities for the Saudi banks over the medium term.  1. The Saudi economy is undergoing unprecedented boom era based on a well- developed and diversified base covering all sectors of the economy, including oil and gas, heavy, medium and light industries; banking, investment and insurance services; and transport and tourism, within a population demographic structure which indicates an expected growth in the segment that would need banking services. These entire factors make the banking and financial services market poised to grow exponentially, with great opportunities for banks to expand in the provision of their conventional services in addition to the expansion in the area of investment banking. Banks will benefit greatly from their expertise and experience to provide advisory services in the area of underwriting and covering of new IPO’s, corporate finance, financing projects, particularly mega projects (in the fields of petroleum and gas, petrochemicals, water, electricity, housing, education and health), mergers and acquisitions, 4 BIS Review 59/2006 
securities advisory services and domestic and international brokerage, private wealth management and asset management businesses. This may require banks restructure their business to cope with new regulations.  It is expected that the financial market will both broaden and deepen, and the competitive edge will be with banks that can innovate and harness new technologies. The great expansion in demand for investment services will tempt international institutions to compete domestic banks in the provision of such services to the various economic sectors.  2. Shariah compliant banking services have recorded continued phenomenal growth in the area of retail, corporate services, and assets management. This area is demand driven and banks that offer new Shariah compliant solutions in response to the market need will benefit which will boost their growth and competition. There is also room to innovate and develop adequate products that would meet customer various financing and investment needs. Domestic banks are playing a leading role in this sector and will continue to maintain their leadership role.  3. In view of the present and expected growing demand, commercial and residential housing financing is poised for exponential growth. This constitutes a great opportunity for banks to develop products that provide a balance between risks and rewards, and meet customers' needs. This will be a very satisfactory development.  4. Company’s issuance of bonds and SUKUKs which is a financing tool not yet implemented by Saudi companies. It has a potential for banks and companies that offer and issue it.  These are the opportunities, but banks will also face many challenges. The most significant are the following:  1. Attracting, training and maintaining skilled staff, as the present and future expansion in the national economy in its various sectors, particularly, the financial sector, will generate a strong demand for financial skills of all specializations. There will also be a sharp competition for the existing skills, and staff rotation may occur at the financial institutions. Hence, all banks and financial institutions should make great efforts to attract and train employees and should invest generously in this area. It is an exaggeration to expect that the number of employees in the financial sector may double over the next five years.  2. Saudi banks will face a more competitive environment both domestically and in the region. This is because with open policies in the Kingdom, the number of banks operating in Saudi Arabia would almost double to 20 by the end of 2006. These will include the best group of regional and international banks, apart from the possibilities which modern technology provides for offering cross-border services. The banks will also compete, in the area of financial and advisory services, with non-banking financial institutions licensed by the Capital Market Authority. These institutions will compete in providing a number of financial and advisory services.  3. In view of the expected increase in demand for bank financing for a number of economic projects in the economic sectors, and the different financing methods, as well as the great development in the field of modern technology, banks will be required to develop methods for risk management and should be aware of the new risks included in these methods. So, qualifications capable of managing such risk to minimum level should be developed. It is also important to continue to comply with international standards in the area of supervision and accounting. The ability to measure and manage risks will require continued awareness of the dynamic nature of banking business in the context of changing markets with renewed risks which require development of outstanding skills, application of secure technology and following an advanced approach in risk assessment.  4. It is expected that banks will face increased demand for the provision of advanced banking services and products to meet the requirements of the era. Therefore, work should focus on creativeness and innovation so that banks can cater to future needs of the different types of their customers. High levels of baking services should be maintained. There should also be expansion in the number of branches, ATMs, telephone banking and other channels.  I wish to conclude with the observation that the Saudi economy is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated growth in the various sectors and activities unprecedented in the preceding decades. This is due to the great regulatory steps taken recently by the state which helped establish a solid base for BIS Review 59/2006 5 
sustained growth. What we have heard recently of huge initiatives and projects in the oil, gas, petrochemical, mining, transport, electricity water sectors and infrastructure projects in housing, education, and health, would indicate the size and momentum of the coming economic expansion which will be accompanied by a notable rise in the per capita income. It is expected that the private sector will have a greater role in these projects and in the pace of the overall activity. Thus, the financial and banking sector is entering a very dynamic and exciting phase with acceleration in all areas. There are new players, new market opportunities, a range of new products and services, and significant growth in traditional services. The financial sector should be able to fully leverage its tradition of openness and liberalization, its large investment in technology infrastructure, internal control, and development of its manpower. It is entering a new era of increased consumer participation and awareness, greater competition, enhanced transparency and strong supervision and corporate governance. The financial sector is in a strong position to rise up to these challenges and meet the demands of a rapidly growing economy and consumer expectation. I emphasize my wishes and expectations that the Saudi Financial Sector will continue to be a leader and a major player in the domestic and regional economic activity.  I thank you for your attention.  6 BIS Review 59/2006 
Donald L Kohn: The effects of globalization on inflation and their implications for monetary policy  Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's 51st Economic Conference, Chatham, Massachusetts, 16 June 2006. *      *      * Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this conference on global imbalances, a topic of growing importance. Although I will touch on global imbalances, I would like to focus on globalization’s potential influence on inflation and the associated implications for monetary policy. It seems a natural focus for a policymaker at a central bank, and, indeed, several of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have also addressed this issue in recent months.1 As you would see from reading their remarks, no consensus has yet emerged about how globalization has been influencing recent inflation developments, and part of my intention today is to illustrate some of the considerable challenges that are involved in attempting to identify the extent to which the recent pickup in the pace of global economic integration has influenced inflation dynamics in the United States.2Of course, the trend toward greater international integration of product and financial markets has been established for quite a while; the share of U.S. economic activity involved in international trade (measured by nominal exports plus imports as a share of nominal gross domestic product) has been rising since the early 1970s. However, this trend has accelerated markedly over the past fifteen years or so. In particular, the economies of eastern Europe became more integrated into the global economy, and China, India, and some other East Asian market economies have emerged as important players in the global trading system. Although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, it seems natural to expect, as others have argued, that these developments would have exerted some downward pressure on inflation in the United States. The opening up of China and India, in particular, represents a potentially huge increase in the global supply of mainly lower-skilled workers. And it is clear that the low cost of production in these and other emerging economies has led to a geographic shift in production toward them - not just from the United States but also from other formerly low-cost producers such as Mexico, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.3 Trade surpluses in China and in other East Asian countries have increased sharply over the past decade, and from a U.S. perspective, the ratio of imported goods to domestically produced goods has accelerated noticeably in recent years.  However, the extent of the disinflationary effect of this shift in the pace of globalization is less obvious. Many U.S. goods and most services are still produced domestically with little competition from abroad. In addition, the significant expansion of production in China and elsewhere has put substantial upward pressure on the prices of oil and other commodities, many of which are imported for use as inputs to production in the United States. Indeed, the effects of globalization on domestic inflation need not even be negative, especially in today’s environment of strong global growth.  One challenge in assessing the effect of increased globalization is the lack of research on this issue. At a research conference on modeling inflation held at the Federal Reserve Board last fall, none of the papers even touched on issues related to globalization. And, although some new and interesting research is emerging from places like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International                                                       1  For example, Richard W.

Settlements, much of this work is still quite preliminary.4 Nevertheless, the existing research does highlight several channels through which globalization might have helped to hold down domestic inflation in recent years. These channels include the direct and indirect effects on domestic inflation of lower import prices, a heightened sensitivity of domestic inflation to foreign demand conditions (and perhaps less sensitivity to domestic demand conditions), downward pressure on domestic wage growth, and upward pressure on domestic productivity growth.5  In trying to clarify my own thinking about the likely magnitude of these effects, I find that a useful starting point is a simple reduced-form equation that attempts to explain movements in inflation and then to ask whether and how the statistical relationships embedded in this equation have been affected by globalization. The equation is a standard one in use at the Board and elsewhere. It relates core consumer price inflation - using, say, the index for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) or the core consumer price index (CPI) - to resource utilization, lagged inflation, changes in relative prices of food and energy, and changes in relative import prices. Using this framework, we can look for the effect of globalization in several ways. First, we can look for influences that are directly controlled for in the model - notably the influence on domestic inflation of changes in import prices. Second, we can look for evidence of globalization-related structural change in the model by examining the stability of the parameter estimates. Third, we can see whether we have omitted from the standard model any variables that might be interpreted as representing changes in globalization. And, finally, we can look for evidence of model errors that would be consistent with the hypothesis that globalization has been restraining inflation. I will focus in particular on the past five years or so, which, judging from the data on U.S. trade shares, is when the pace of globalization appears to have picked up.  I will start with the import price channel - the hypothesis that increased globalization has depressed import prices and thus domestic inflation. Importantly, the estimated strength of this channel should capture not only the direct effects of import prices on the cost of living in the United States but, also, at least a portion of the indirect effects of actual and potential import competition on the prices of goods produced domestically. In the reduced-form model that I’ve just described, the effects of import prices on inflation show up quite clearly; furthermore, the estimated effects appear to have increased over time, with the increase apparently stemming primarily from the upward trend in the share of imported consumer goods in household spending.6We can use the model to get a rough idea of how relative changes in import prices have influenced domestic inflation by simulating how core consumer prices would have behaved if relative import prices had instead remained constant. In particular, the increase in core import prices since the mid-1990s has averaged about 1-1/2 percentage points less per year than the increase in core consumer prices. According to the model simulation, which also builds in the associated reduction in inflation expectations, the direct and indirect effects of this decline in the relative price of imports held down core inflation by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point per year over this period, an estimated effect that is substantially larger than it would have been in earlier decades. However, much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by movements in exchange rates and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets.7In addition, import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in                                                       4  Thomas Helbling, Florence Jaumotte, and Martin Sommer (2006), "How Has Globalization Affected Inflation?" IMF World Economic Outlook (Washington: IMF, April), chapter 3; Claudio Borio and Andrew Filardo (2006), "Globalization and Inflation: New Cross-Country Evidence on the Global Determinants of Domestic Inflation," unpublished paper, Bank for International Settlements, March.  5  Ken Rogoff also argues that globalization has increased the incentives for central banks to keep inflation low (Kenneth S. Rogoff, 2003, "Globalization and Global Disinflation," in Monetary Policy and Uncertainty: Adapting to a Changing Economy," a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, pp. 77-112.) 6  As is standard in such models, we use a price measure for "core" imports, defined as imports of goods excluding energy, computers, and semiconductors. When the change in relative import prices is weighted by the import share, the coefficient in the model is fairly stable. 7  Research at the Board examined the direct effects of Chinese exports on global import prices from the mid-1990s to 2002 and found only a modest effect of U.S. import prices. Of course, it is possible that China’s influence on import prices has grown in recent years as its trade share has expanded. Refer to Steven B. Kamin, Mario Marazzi, and John W. Schindler (2004), "Is China ‘Exporting Deflation’?" International Finance Discussion Paper 2004-791 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, January). 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
the United States. This step-up in the rate of change of import prices obviously reflects, to some extent, recent movements in the dollar, especially its depreciation in 2004. However, it also reflects large increases in the prices of a number of imported commodities, which have been attributed in part to the rapid expansion of activity in China and other Asian countries.  A second hypothesis is that increases in global capacity have held down U.S. inflation in recent years by limiting the ability of U.S. producers to raise prices in response to increases in the domestic costs of production. At a basic level, the elevated profit margins of U.S. producers over the past few years seem inconsistent with this hypothesis. But it does raise a broader issue about the determinants of inflation - that is, whether U.S. inflation is now less sensitive to domestic demand pressures and more sensitive to foreign demand conditions than it was earlier. In the context of the inflation model, we can examine this issue in two ways. First, we can look for evidence that the coefficients on the domestic output or unemployment gaps have fallen over time. Second, we can add a measure of foreign excess demand to the model to see whether it helps to explain domestic inflation in recent years. With regard to the first test, we do find evidence that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has fallen in the United States. In particular, the coefficient from a model estimated over the past twenty years appears to be about one-third lower than when the model is run over a forty-year period. Of course, globalization is not the only potential explanation for this result, and numerous other researchers have cited persistently low inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy as having played a more important role. In fact, in rolling regressions, the timing of the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment gap appears to be too early to be associated with the more recent acceleration in the pace of globalization.  This aspect of the globalization hypothesis would be bolstered if the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic demand was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to foreign demand. Efforts to find such a link have met with mixed results, with some researchers having found large effects and others having found no effect.8 Our own analysis of this issue indicates that these results are sensitive to how the foreign output gap is defined and to how the inflation model is specified, suggesting that any effect may not be especially strong. Similarly, the evidence that globalization has helped to restrain unit labor costs in recent years is mixed. One hypothesis is that the increase in the supply of low-skilled workers associated with the emergence of China and other East Asian countries as low-cost centers of production has put downward pressure on the growth of nominal wages in the United States. However, a model of changes in aggregate labor compensation that is similar in structure to the price-inflation model that I described earlier does not detect a stable relationship between measures of globalization (for example, import price changes or the BIS estimates of the foreign output gap) and aggregate wage dynamics in the United States. That said, the recent changes in some, though not all, measures of aggregate compensation seem to have been somewhat lower than such models would have predicted. Of course, several purely domestic factors could help to account for any shortfall, such as the aftereffects of the unusually sluggish recovery in job growth early in this expansion or a possible downward drift in the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment. But it also is a pattern that would be consistent with downward pressures from an expansion in global labor supply. In support of this link, some cross-section studies have found a relationship between industry wage growth and import penetration, while the research on wage inequality tends to relate some of the relative decline in wages of low-skilled workers to trade, although in both types of studies the effects are generally relatively small.9 Similarly, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a modest relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and wage growth, with larger effects evident for the wages of lower-skilled workers.10                                                      8  Borio and Filardo (2006) and Gamber and Hung (2001) found that foreign resource utilization had sizable effects on U.S. inflation, while Tootell (1998) found little to no effect. Refer to Borio and Filardo, "Globalization and Inflation"; Edward N. Gamber and Juann H. Hung (2001), "Has the Rise in Globalization Reduced U.S. Inflation in the 1990s?"

A second possibility is that globalization has restrained unit labor costs by raising productivity. Increasing volumes of trade should bolster productivity as economies concentrate their resources in those sectors in which they are relatively more efficient. But I have seen little direct evidence on the extent to which globalization may have boosted aggregate productivity growth in the United States in recent years. Nevertheless, research at the Board finds that multinational corporations, which may have the greater opportunities to realize efficiencies by shifting production locations, accounted for a disproportionate share of aggregate productivity growth in the late 1990s.11 And some microeconomic studies have found a relationship between global engagement and productivity at the firm level.12 Thus, it seems possible that the persistently high growth rates of multifactor productivity in recent years may partly be due to the productivity-enhancing effects of globalization. In this regard, I would note that a potential shortcoming of my approach to assessing the effects of globalization on inflation is that these effects may be too recent to be captured adequately by the data. That is, it may be too soon for globalization to have generated statistically observable changes in the parameter estimates or structure of the standard inflation model. Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends. For example, if recent increases in world labor supply are restraining domestic unit labor costs to a significant degree or if there are other important influences on inflation that are related to globalization but difficult to quantify in the context of the standard model, we would expect to have seen sizable model errors over the past several years. Again, the evidence points to some limited influence of globalization on U.S. inflation. If we use out-of-sample dynamic simulations of a model for core PCE price inflation estimated from 1985 through the end of 2001, we find that, although the model overpredicts inflation over the past several years, the errors average only 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point per year, considerably less than one might have expected given the anecdotes in the popular press. In contrast, the forecast errors from a model of core CPI inflation are larger (averaging roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point per year since mid-2001), perhaps suggestive of some influence from globalization.  What do I conclude from all of this evidence? My own assessment is that, quite naturally, the greater integration of the U.S. economy into a rapidly evolving world economy has affected the dynamics of inflation determination. Unfortunately, huge gaps and puzzles remain in our analysis and empirical testing of various hypotheses related to these effects. But, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive. In particular, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system probably has exerted a modest disinflationary force on prices in the United States in recent years.  Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years. They reflect, at least in part, the global imbalances that are the subject of this conference, rather than just the integration of emerging-market economies into the global trading system. For example, the fact that China and some other emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressure on their exchange rates and are running trade surpluses has undoubtedly contributed to their disinflationary effects on the rest of the world. The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding. These imbalances are not likely to be sustained indefinitely. The elevated rates of national saving in these economies - and, in some, relatively restrained rates of investment - are not likely to persist in the face of ongoing improvements in the functioning of their financial markets, increases in the depth of their product markets, and fuller development of economic safety nets. As individuals in these countries are increasingly drawn to investing at home and consuming more of their wealth and as their real wages catch up to past productivity gains, the upward pressures on their currencies will intensify, their demand will come into better alignment with their capacity to produce, cost advantages will                                                       11  Carol Corrado, Paul Lengermann, and Larry Slifman (2005), "The Contribution of MNCs to U.S. Productivity Growth, 1977-2000," unpublished paper, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 12  For example, Mark E. Doms and J. Bradford Jensen (1998), "Productivity, Skill, and Wage Effects of Multinational Corporations in the United States," in D. Woodward and D.

decline, and these economies will exert less, if any, downward pressure on inflation in the United States.  This observation brings me to my final point, which is about monetary policy. Clearly, the greater integration of the world’s economies does leave the United States more open to influences from abroad. In one sense, a more open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports. And, to the extent that the United States can draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped for a time. But we are also subject to inflationary forces from abroad, including those that might accompany a shift to a more sustainable pattern of global spending and production, or those that might emanate from rising cost and price pressures. Moreover, a smaller response of inflation to domestic demand also implies that reducing inflation once it rose could be difficult and costly. And, from another perspective, integrated financial markets can exert powerful feedback, which may be less forgiving of any perceived policy error. For example, if financial market participants thought that the FOMC was not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability - a notion that I can assure you is not correct - they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets, and the resulting decline in the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures. Clearly, policymakers need to factor into their decisions the implications of globalization for the dynamics of the determination of inflation and output. In the end, however, policymakers here and abroad cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: In a world of separate currencies that can fluctuate against each other over time, each country’s central bank determines its inflation rate. If the FOMC were to allow the U.S. economy to run beyond its sustainable potential for some time, inflation would eventually rise. And, this pickup would become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations. Thus, while a better understanding of the implications of globalization will aid in our understanding of inflation dynamics, it is also clear that such developments do not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability.

Stanley Fischer: “The Paris Club at Fifty” Address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Paris Club, Paris, 14 June 2006.  These remarks were prepared for presentation at the ”Fiftieth Anniversary conference of the Paris Club”, to be held in Paris on June 14, 2006. I am grateful to Mark Allen of the IMF for helpful discussions.  *      *      * It is a pleasure and an honor for me to take part in this celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Paris Club – both as a former official of the IMF, who learned so much from the former Chairman of the Paris Club with whom I had the pleasure of working for over five years, and as Governor of the Bank of Israel. The Paris Club is the gifted child of the French Tresor. But it is also in many ways a British institution – and I take that to be a compliment. It is a club, a voluntary gathering of interested parties, it operates without a written constitution, it operates case-by-case, and it displays a remarkable pragmatism and flexibility that has enabled it to evolve and deal with an enormous variety of debt problems over the years – over 400 agreements with over 80 debtor countries and more than $500 billion rescheduled. In performing its essential task, it has stood the cause of development well over the past fifty years. And at the age of fifty, it faces new challenges that ensure that it will have to continue to evolve with the times. I.  Debt relief Like the Bank for International Settlements, the Paris Club grew out of the need for debt relief – a need which has been with us for as long as debt has existed. In gradually developing a flexible set of rules for granting relief on inter-governmental debts, mostly the debts of developing countries, the Club has made a major contribution to the orderly operation of the international financial system.  The principle of conditionality is critical. By making the conditionality that of the IMF, the Paris Club gained at least two major benefits for the international community: that of operating with the Fund’s skilled professionals, who understand how to design and monitor an economic program; and the legitimacy of operating within an institutional framework in which both the creditors and debtors are members. In turn, by putting the IMF at center stage in developing and enforcing conditionality, the Club contributed to the development of the Fund’s analytic and operational approach. There are nonetheless major questions about the effectiveness of the combination of conditionality, concessional loans, and debt relief. These can be summarized by recognizing that many countries that received conditional debt relief once, received it again – and again. The underlying question is why it has turned out to be so difficult for many of the poorest countries to begin to grow on a sustained basis, despite receiving aid that amounted to double digit percentages of their GDP over long periods, and despite being in IMF and World Bank programs. I suspect that if we were to go back to the participants in Paris Club discussions in the fifties and sixties, they would say that income levels in many of the countries whose debts they rescheduled are much lower today than they would have imagined in their most pessimistic moments.  These concerns relate mainly to some African countries. Many African countries have been growing more rapidly recently, so maybe we are beginning to turn a corner. The renewal of growth is helped by the global commodities boom, and the fact that several African countries are now exporters of oil. Developments in South Africa are encouraging, and South African growth affects the countries around it. Nigeria too is making progress, helped by a Paris Club agreement and by the price of oil. But the facts remain that the number of people in poverty in Africa is increasing, that a greater share of the world’s poor live in Africa than ever before, and that AIDS and other diseases are exerting a devastating effect on populations in many countries.  It is easier to raise questions about the effectiveness of conditional debt relief than to answer them. For the problem is not particularly that of conditional debt relief, it is rather the question of what development strategies are most likely to succeed. I will not go into that question in any detail now, beyond saying that while we know many of the necessary conditions for growth, we do not yet know the sufficient conditions. BIS Review 57/2006 1 
Over the course of its lifetime, Paris Club rescheduling became increasingly far-reaching. The original approach of flow rescheduling combined with new money lasted for about thirty years. In the late 1980s under the Brady Plan, Paris Club reschedulings began to include relief on the stock of debt. Now we all know that to a first approximation what matters is the present value of the debt, so that there is no difference in the economics of flow versus stock reschedulings.1 Nonetheless the shift from flow to stock debt reduction was a major change, in part because budget accounting in some countries made stock reduction more difficult politically – and in part no doubt because once the principle of not reducing the stock of debt was breached, there was only one logical resting point for the process.  That resting point is the cancellation of all outstanding debts, and a switch from loans to grants. That approach has now been accepted by first the G8 and then by most of the creditor nations, in several cases reluctantly. So long as net transfers to the countries in need of aid rise, the grant approach is obviously better from the viewpoint of debt sustainability, ceteris paribus. But it is not yet clear that net transfers will rise as the approach to aid switches from loans to grants. Indeed, the main argument against the new approach is that it may reduce the net flow of aid to countries most in need. It remains to be seen whether that will be the case. In discussing loans versus grants it is sometimes argued – and I confess to having sometimes argued – that by making loans rather than grants, the donors encourage greater responsibility on the part of the recipient governments who have to contemplate repaying the loans. The fact that these loans often have long grace periods, and that governments often have short horizons, reduces the plausibility of this argument. I put more weight on a related argument: that for many governments it is politically easier to make concessional loans rather than grants, and that the IDA cum Paris Club approach in effect turns these loans into some sort of high-risk but concessional bond claim on the recipient country.  Those who believe aid is in any case ineffective would see a reduction in aid as a benefit of the new approach. I continue to believe that aid targeted to particular needs, including health and education, and project aid can be useful and should be supported if the circumstances are reasonable, and that for governments following the right policies, general budgetary assistance can also be productive. On balance I believe the empirical evidence supports this view.  But there is little doubt that the overall record of the aid process is disappointing, that in some cases aid failures are associated with serious government corruption, and that the aid process itself may contribute to government corruption. All these issues have come to the fore in the last decade, and the increasing attention they have been receiving should help improve the record.  II.  On the creditor side The Paris Club solved the free rider problem by seeking to bring all the major creditors into the Club, by requiring a consensus for each decision and requiring participant creditors not to seek better terms outside the framework, and by insisting that the debtor not give better terms to any other creditor. Because the Club does not require uniformity of treatment among different debtors – a principle which would be difficult to enshrine in a written charter – it has shown considerable flexibility and ingenuity in dealing with the different forms in which creditors are willing to provide relief, and in inviting relevant non-Paris Club members to take part in meetings as needed. Of course this also means that political considerations visibly play a role in deciding on the treatment each debtor receives, but that is hardly surprising when inter-governmental debt is being considered. For many years the Paris Club protected the senior status of the IMF and the World Bank, and did not request any debt reduction on their part. The logic of this approach was quite simple: generally the Fund and the Bank provided new money. This principle has now been breached, and it remains to be seen what the long-term consequences will be. But we should recall that countries include claims on the Fund as part of their reserves, and that at the time of the HIPC debt relief decision, at least one major country said that it would have to reappraise that view. While the Club is able to produce an acceptable extent of comparable concessions by official creditors operating within its framework, it has increasingly had to deal with the issues arising from the growing                                                       1 In addition, liquidity is likely to be important for a country without market access 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
role of the private sector in financing developing countries, and those that result from the growing importance of official creditors who are not members, prominent among them China.  There are two issues with regard to the role of the private sector. The first is the pace at which countries that have received debt relief begin borrowing from the market. So long as a country is in an IMF program, the Fund has been able to exert some – though not necessarily a decisive – influence on the rate of government borrowing from the private sector. If the country has exited from an IMF program, it is left to market and internal fiscal discipline to control its rate of borrowing. We need to remind ourselves that until very recently we were in a phase of optimism about the emerging market and developing countries, with plentiful liquidity, and that these conditions could change. At that point we might discover that market and internal fiscal discipline may not be sufficient to prevent problems in the event of a reduction in capital flows to developing countries. The second problem arises if debt rescheduling then becomes necessary. At this point coordination and equality of treatment between public and private sector lenders becomes difficult, and the Paris Club has yet to arrive at a fully satisfactory solution. In addition, some members of the private sector argued that the claims of the Fund and the Bank should be included in any restructuring. This demand was clearest in the Argentine case, where some private sector participants demanded that the IMF also agree to debt reduction. The logic of this claim on the organization which operates as an emergency lender was not clear. The issue of private-public sector coordination in lending and debt restructuring poses a delicate problem for the official sector, which after all would prefer countries eventually to finance themselves through the markets – provided they do so in a sustainable way. The principles of debt restructuring proposed by the IIF, and described in more detail by Jacques de Larosiere in his comments this afternoon are useful in themselves, but putting them into practice will not be easy in individual cases. This was evident in the Argentine case, but that perhaps was exceptionally difficult. Most recently, the Paris Club has become concerned that countries that have received debt relief are borrowing heavily from other official lenders, who are not members of the Club, notably China. The concerns here are that countries may be taking on more debt than is wise, and that in the event the global financial situation changes, future debt restructurings will be much more difficult than those of the past. The answer to this concern may well lie in the wider context, in which the global financial architecture that was developed after World War II needs to adapt to the presence of important new players, among them particularly the BRIC countries. As these new players from Asia and elsewhere begin to take more responsibility for the system, and as the system gives them and their concerns a greater role, they may begin to appreciate the importance of existing institutions, formal and informal.  And we may be sure that in any case, the ingenuity and pragmatism that the Paris Club has demonstrated in its first fifty years, will continue to contribute to the development of the international financial system and its ability to deal with official sector debt difficulties.

Shamshad Akhtar: Development of microfinance Keynote address by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, at the Seminar on “Beyond Charity : Commercial Opportunities in Micro and Small Lending”, jointly organized by USAID and Shore Bank International, Islamabad, 6 June 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, let me welcome you all to the one-day international seminar on “Commercial Opportunities in Micro and Small Business Lending”, jointly organized by USAID and Shore Bank International. The seminar comes at the heels of a ‘pro-poor, pro-employment’ budget 2006/07, which has a special allocation of Rs. 10 billion for the Khushhal Pakistan Fund, in addition to employment generation schemes. Pakistan has enormous potential for the development and exploitation of the microfinance industry. At the onset, the concept of Microfinance as a tool and mechanism for poverty alleviation needs to be well understood. It refers to the provision of a whole range of financial services to lower-income people, especially the poor, who can use the funding to finance their businesses, acquire household assets, improve consumption, invest in health and education and fund emergencies and social obligations. Its definition has to be broad based to include micro-credit1 for tiny informal businesses and micro-entrepreneurs who are provided loans and a range of savings products and transfer services.2A range of options exist to intermediate microfinance which goes beyond NGOs, and includes commercial banks, state-owned development banks, financial cooperatives, and a variety of other licensed and unlicensed non-bank financial institutions. Setting aside the broader framework for microfinance, it is important to recognize that Pakistan is a late starter in developing the microfinance industry. There is a lot of work ahead to promote and systematically develop this sector. At the same time, it is important to note that Pakistan’s microfinance industry has followed a conventional route and has taken some significant initiatives to set on course the development agenda for microfinance. Moving away from the traditional reliance on nationalized banks to finance small farmers (which were seen as the primary universe in terms of being eligible for micro-credit) and the few NGOs which provided a range of special rural support or special urban slum targeted programs, Pakistan has now entered a new phase of microfinance development. The country has witnessed a wave of experimental programs. Sequentially, some sponsors promoted a number of foundations e.g. the Kashf Foundation program modeled along the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, the Taraqi Foundation and the Damen Foundation. Other major initiatives include setting up of donor led apex arrangements such as the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and the Microfinance Sector Development Program (MSDP) which promotes the development of the microfinance policy framework while funding select institutions through foreign exchange credit lines. Subsequently, State Bank of Pakistan took a more holistic approach towards the development of the microfinance industry by developing the (i) policy, legal and regulatory framework of the microfinance industry, and (ii) promoting diversity and sustainability in the microfinance business. All such businesses are licensed and supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan and have to comply with Prudential Regulations for Microfinance Banks (MFBs). Today, along with the traditional NGO based programs, Pakistan has about six MFBs of which 2 have been in operation for around 4-5 years whereas four have been recently licensed with one MFB having been licensed a week or two back. In tandem, there is a formally recognized Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN), which is self regulated. PMN members are a mix of the banks, leasing companies and focused financial services agencies along with the conventional NGOs that offer services to special segments of the society and community.                                                       1  Average microcredit loan balances tend be below per-capita national income. 2  Insurance is an important financial service that is often unavailable to lower-income clients and can therefore also be considered to be a component of ‘microfinance.’ However, insurance involves different regulatory issues that are beyond the scope of this paper. BIS Review 57/2006 1 
It is estimated that all told, 40 Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) operate in Pakistan out of which 19 institutions are members of PMN which capture almost 99% of the MFIs market. Today, this network offers over 400 outlets of which 308 are branches of PMN members, besides which there are 92 MFIs with 145 service centres. Cumulatively the outstanding loans of these institutions are no more that Rs 3 billion and deposits of Rs 6.6 billion of which the bulk is so far intermediated through PMN members. Unlike some countries, Pakistan has lifted prohibitions and limitations on the participation of foreign equity holders (or founders / members in case of NGOs), borrowing from foreign sources, and employment of non-citizens in management or technical positions. This should go a long way to help set up businesses on modern lines and will also bring with it the necessary experience and technological support for this industry. While development is underway, it is important to recognize the challenges we are beset with. Of principal concern is the low coverage of Microfinance services. The Microfinance institutional framework currently supports barely 600,000 active borrowers. Existing coverage of the formal microfinance sector is only 10% of the estimated 6 million households in need of Microfinance. The requirements clearly are above these norms as currently one fourth of the population of Pakistan is below the poverty line. Another feature is the high concentration across institutions, in lending and among clients. Khushhali Bank and PMN provide the bulk of the services given their edge in starting business early on. But these institutions have only provided lending facilities without adequately tapping the deposit base of their clients. Also, their lending profiles reflect a degree of concentration in select regions and sectors. As of March 2006, 41% of loans distributed by the MFBs are for agri-inputs, 24% for livestock, 26% for small enterprises and 9% for other purposes. This is because Khushhali Bank which accounts for the bulk of this business is rural focused. An analysis of gender-wise loans granted reveals that 84% of borrowers are male. Average loan size of MFBs is Rs 9,300. The microfinance business further faces difficulty in accessing alternative sources of investment - particularly equity investment - which is a world wide problem. Knowing how to conduct micro-businesses is an additional challenge in Pakistan given its low financial and accounting literacy. The newly licensed institutions will not only help in diversifying the institutional risk and provide better coverage, but also introduce the much needed competition in this area. SBP has further developed the legal framework for microfinance institutions. MFIs are governed and regulated by the MFIs Ordinance, 2001, the promulgation of which resulted in a paradigm shift in the microfinance industry, and has laid the foundation for the systematic growth of the sector. Microfinance is now seen as a major tool for eradicating poverty. MFIs’ paid up capital requirements are lower than commercial banks at Rs 250 million,3 and to promote flexibility and innovation, SBP has adopted international standards in establishing requirements for capital adequacy, maximum loan size, credit and operational risks, KYC norms etc. The Finance Bill for 2006 now includes the long awaited amendments and refinements in the MFI Ordinance of 2001. Among others, the amendments; (i) empower SBP to introduce flexibility and broadening of Microfinance Institutions to include Microfinance Banks, (ii) give SBP flexibility in the determination of CRR and SLR with a flexible monitoring system, (iii) provide SBP the option of determining the definition/threshold income level of the poor, (iv) strengthen provisions to introduce explicit clauses regarding licensing of new MFIs, separate licensing requirements for existing NGO-MFIs, new start-up MFBs as well as improving provisions related to suspension of licenses, (v) bring in line with SECP guidelines on corporate governance, the terms of external auditors and extending period of submission of accounts, and  (vi) strengthen regulatory powers of SBP. These amendments are quite far reaching, are in line with the stakeholder’s demands and hold the promise of providing the desired level of flexibility both at the regulatory cum supervisory level, while                                                       3  For provincial level MFB. The minimum requirements are Rs 100 million for district level, 500 million for national level. 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
easing constraints of the industry. Microfinance Institutions will now be able to tailor their products to meet the needs of their customers as they move along the prosperity continuum. The amendments have also made it possible to increase the business viability and diversity of institutions by the emergence of Regional Microfinance Banks that might obtain license for five adjacent districts with the prescribed minimum capital requirements.4 The enhanced regulatory powers of SBP are aimed to ensure proper regulatory and supervisory oversight of the licensed MFBs. The amendments would also help improve the corporate governance of microfinance banks to become socially responsible and financially sustainable institutions. As an additional feature, mobile banking guidelines have been designed to facilitate MFBs to penetrate their target market. SBP has issued NGOs/Rural Support Programs/Cooperative Transformation guidelines. Fit and proper criteria has been laid down for CEOs and Management of MFBs. Guidelines have also been issued for commercial banks interested in engaging in microfinance business. Some unfounded myths often complicate the development and understandings of microfinance. Recognizing this, in Pakistan we need to encourage a paradigm shift in the rapidly evolving operating environment for the microfinance sector. (cid:190) First, there is a need to move away from subsidization of microfinance services to commercialization of such financial services. This, among others, involves looking beyond the government or donor subsidized credit delivery systems to self sufficient institutions providing commercial finance. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) and Bolivia's fini institutions BancoSol, both leaders in the microfinance revolution, are good examples among others to study what it means to be a financially self-sufficient microfinance institution. Both banks provide wide outreach to low-income clients, encourage commercialization, and both have been profitable. BRI finances its loan portfolio with locally mobilized savings; and BancoSol finances its loans with savings, commercial debt, and for-profit investment. In both institutions, the relationship between sustainability and outreach is emphasized. (cid:190) Move from single to multiple products is key to financial and social sustainability of microfinance industry. There are three basic microfinance products: loans, savings and insurance;  Loans •  Mostly short term working capital •  Larger loans for fixed assets •  Housing  Savings • Mostly compulsory savings used a loan guarantee as protection to the lender. Most microcredit operations and MFIs cannot mobilize deposits without a license from the Central Bank. Member societies can mobilize savings from their members. • Savings are often a more appropriate financial product for the very poor than credit. This implies working with formal financial sector institutions, ROSCAS5 and member societies. Insurance • Loan insurance is most common. • Common ways of providing loan insurance are: • purchased by the borrower when taking a loan as a percentage of the loan;                                                       4  Rs. 150 million. 5  Rotating Savings and Credit Associations BIS Review 57/2006 3 
• establishing an emergency fund in village banks, community loan associations and other groups; and  • compulsory savings. (cid:190) Third, financially sustainability of microfinance is contingent on recognizing that the credit has to be priced effectively. The administrative cost of delivery, disbursing and collecting a micro or tiny loan portfolio is much higher in comparison with conventional loan portfolios. So the borrowers end up paying interest rates that are substantially higher than the rates banks charge to their traditional borrowers. According to a recent ADB study, the nominal interest rate charged by MFIs in the Asia region ranges between 30-70% (on reducing balance) which is excessively high given that the inflationary trends are relatively low. The key to reducing costs is to introduce market competition, innovation and efficiency. Further, MFIs should disclose their effective interest rates to loan applicants on standard guidelines. The mandated discipline of disclosing effective interest rates may help micro lenders in focusing on steps they can take to increase their efficiency and thus lower their rates. (cid:190) Fourth, options to enhance the access to credit for the lower income group can be augmented by the combination of credit bureaus and statistical risk-scoring techniques. In the context of Pakistan, simpler solutions involve verification based on the national identity card (NIC) or new technology popularly adopted by NADRA i.e. thumbprint readers and retinal scanners. When MFIs begin to compete with each other for customers, over-indebtedness and default will rise sharply unless they have access to a database that captures relevant aspects of their clients’ borrowing behavior. (cid:190) Fifth, Know Your Customer, Educate and Give Voice to Clients. MFBs/MFIs need to know their customer, know their market and design products to fit the financial requirements of the people they serve. The design of products is based on the financial requirements of the household and the economic activities the household supports. Successful MFIs are responsive to the market. They listen to their customers. To conclude, it is important to recognize that recent initiatives and developments in Pakistan’s microfinance sector are impressive and there is enormous potential for the industry to expand and for the population to exploit these financial services to their benefit. The outreach of these institutions has grown recently, albeit at a slow rate, and the numbers and beneficiaries remain much below our requirements as well as the standards prevailing in other developing countries. 4 BIS Review 57/2006 
Usha Thorat: Treating bank customers fairly - regulatory initiatives  Inaugural address by Ms Usha Thorat, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Financial Planning Congress 2006 on “Establishing consumer Centric Financial Services Delivery Infrastructure”, organised by the Financial Planning Standards Board India, New Delhi, 29 May 2006.  *      *      * It gives me great pleasure to participate in this Congress organised by the Financial Planning Standards Board India. Today, there is much more awareness of the need to protect consumers' rights and ensure fair practices in financial services. Countries are designating specific regulators or self regulatory watch dogs for overseeing whether there is mis-selling and whether fair and transparent practices are being observed by financial intermediaries. While specific grievances relating to deficiency in financial services can be a matter for consumer courts or the concerned ombudsman, from a systemic point of view, it is recognised that services have to be benchmarked against codes and standards developed by all stakeholders and as a matter of public policy. In this context, an organisation such as the FPSB India whose mission is the development and promotion of standards for financial planning professionals to benefit among others, the general public is indeed timely and relevant. The FPSB needs to be congratulated for holding this Congress, which I am sure, will throw up a number of issues keeping in view the central theme viz. the interests of the consumer. I am glad to note that the FPSB India is also focusing on financial literacy and solutions for the rural population.  The focus on the common man is extremely important in our country as he is usually the neglected one. At the annual meeting of IBA last Friday, the Hon'ble Finance Minister has talked about financial inclusion and targeting the bottom of the pyramid. With greater penetration of formal financial services into the economy and society, there is a need for ensuring evolution and adherence to codes and standards in delivering financial services to the financially excluded.  The banking system in India today has perhaps the largest outreach for delivery of financial services. Apart from the traditional financial products viz. deposits, loans and money transfer, bank branches are also serving as an important conduit for delivery of mutual funds, other capital market and insurance products. The number of savings accounts with scheduled commercial banks in India stood at little over 300 million in March 2005. If one were to take into account cooperative banks, the number would be even higher. Taking into account the number of households in the country this number certainly represents a significant coverage. Hence, evolving standards for bank service to depositors and the common person has to be a very important part of financial planning standards. Recognising an institutional gap in measuring the performance of the banks against codes and standards based on established best practices, Reserve Bank of India has taken the initiative in setting up the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI). It is an autonomous and independent body, adopting the stance of a self-regulatory organisation in the larger interest of improving the quality of customer services by the Indian banking system. Banks register themselves with the Board as its members and provide services as per the agreed standards and codes. The Board in turn, monitors and assesses the compliance with codes and standards which the banks have agreed to. The registration of banks with the BCSBI, as members, enables the Reserve Bank of India to derive greater supervisory comfort, so also the customers of the member banks. This would also enable the BCSBI to accommodate the bank-specific differences in the customer service related benchmarks set by the banks for themselves. I think there would be considerable synergy in the FPSB exchanging views and interacting with the BCSBI.  The BCSBI represents the latest in a series of initiatives taken by RBI for addressing the issues relating to fair practices for bank customers especially the common person. I wish to take this opportunity today to give you an outline of Reserve Bank’s efforts in this field and its vision for the future, in which the Financial Planning Standards Board, can play a complementary role. In the late seventies, RBI had advised banks to adopt the recommendations of the Talwar Working Group constituted by Government in 1975 to study the quality of customer service in banks. This was more or less the first regulatory initiative in imposing certain discipline on the banks to render quality service. This was followed by several and guidelines covering different areas of bank's interfaces with customers.  BIS Review 57/2006 1 
Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services (CPPAPS) In November 2003, while presenting the mid-term review of the annual monetary and credit policy for the year 2003-04, Governor Reddy brought into sharp focus the inadequacy in banking services available to common person and the need to benchmark the current level of service, review the progress periodically, enhance the timeliness and quality, rationalize the processes taking into account technological developments, and suggest appropriate incentives to facilitate change on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, he set up the Standing Committee on Procedures and Performance Audit on Public Services under the able and sagely Chairmanship of Shri S.S.Tarapore. The approach of the CPPAPS was unique in that it started its evaluation from the customer-end and was totally customer-centric. Shri Tarapore and other members of the Committee undertook incognito visits to bank branches including RBI’s offices for a first hand experience of difficulties faced by the public at large. The Committee was both clinical and critical in its observations and made a number of recommendations covering an individual customer's dealing with the bank in the areas of foreign exchange, currency and government transactions including pension, besides the main relationship as an account holder. I am taking this opportunity for highlighting the regulations issued to banks on aspects covering bank accounts following the Committee's recommendations. • Banks are required to inform customers upfront about the requirement of minimum balances and the charges if such balances are not maintained. They are also required to inform customers one month in advance any changes in such minimum balances and charges.  • Banks are also required to provide a choice of a ‘no frills account’ where the minimum balance is nil or very small but having restrictions on number of withdrawals etc. to facilitate common man’s access to bank accounts. • It has been clarified to banks that NRO accounts can be held jointly with residents. • In case of collection of cheques , banks are required to formulate and disclose their policy for affording immediate credit, time frame for collection and interest payment for delayed collection, taking care to ensure that the interests of the small depositors are fully protected. The policy should clearly lay down the liability of the banks by way of interest payments due to delays for non-compliance with the standards set by the banks themselves. Compensation by way of interest payment, where necessary, should be made without any claim from the customer.  • Banks are required to provide both the drop box facility and the facility for acknowledgement of the cheques at the regular collection counters and no branch should refuse to give an acknowledgement if the customer tenders the cheques at the counters.  • Depositors cannot be forced to sign a declaration that dispatch of cheques book by courier is at the depositor's risk as it constitutes an unfair practice. Banks should also ensure that cheque books are delivered over the counters on request to the depositors or his authorised representative. • Banks have been advised to ensure that brief, intelligible particulars are invariably entered in passbooks / statements of account and they adhere to the prescribed monthly periodicity while sending statement of accounts. • It has been clarified to banks that payment to the survivor /nominee of a deceased depositor where there is a valid nomination or where the account has been opened with a survivorship clause is a valid discharge of liability provided inter alia it has been made clear to the survivor(s) / nominee that he would be receiving the payment from the bank as a trustee of the legal heirs of the deceased depositor, i.e., such payment to him shall not affect the right or claim which any person may have against the survivor(s) / nominee to whom the payment is made. In such cases insistence on production of legal representation is unwarranted and would, invite serious supervisory disapproval. In such case, therefore, while making payment to the survivor(s) / nominee of the deceased depositor, the banks have to desist from insisting on production of succession certificate, letter of administration or probate, etc., or obtain any bond of indemnity or surety from the survivor(s)/nominee, irrespective of the amount standing to the credit of the deceased account holder. • In case where the deceased depositor had not made any nomination or for the accounts other than those styled as "either or survivor" (such as single or jointly operated accounts), banks have been told to adopt a simplified procedure for repayment to legal heir(s) of the 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
depositor keeping in view the imperative need to avoid inconvenience and undue hardship to the common person. In this context, banks may, keeping in view their risk management systems, fix a minimum threshold limit, for the balance in the account of the deceased depositors, up to which claims in respect of the deceased depositors could be settled without insisting on production of any documentation other than a letter of indemnity. • In the case of term deposits, banks are advised to incorporate a clause in the account opening form itself to the effect that in the event of the death of the depositor, premature termination of term deposits would be allowed. The conditions subject to which such premature withdrawal would be permitted may also be specified in the account opening form. Such premature withdrawal would not attract any penal charge. • In order to avoid hardship to the survivor(s) / nominee of a deposit account, banks are advised to obtain appropriate agreement / authorization from the survivor(s) / nominee with regard to the treatment of pipeline flows in the name of the deceased account holder. • Banks are advised to settle the claims in respect of deceased depositors and release payments to survivor(s) / nominee(s) within a period not exceeding 15 days from the date of receipt of the claim subject to the production of proof of death of the depositor and suitable identification of the claim(s), to the bank's satisfaction. • Information should not be gathered in the name of KYC with the intention of using it for cross-selling of services. The banks should obtain the information required for opening an account independent of any other information that they may seek for cross-selling purposes with the consent of the customer. The forms containing this information must not be a part of the account opening form. • The KYC procedure for opening accounts for those persons who intend to keep balances not exceeding rupees fifty thousand (Rs. 50,000/-) in all their accounts taken together and the total credit in all the accounts taken together is not expected to exceed rupees one lakh (Rs. 1,00,000/-) in a year has been simplified to enable those belonging to low income groups without documents of identity and proof of residence to open banks accounts. In such cases banks can take introduction from an account holder on whom full KYC procedure has been completed and has had satisfactory transactions with the bank for at least six months. Photograph of the customer who proposes to open the account and his address need to be certified by the introducer. Considering the significant growth in credit cards in the recent years and the experiences of banks and customers with this product, the Reserve Bank issued detailed guidelines on credit card operations of banks in November 2005. These guidelines, aimed at protecting customer’s interest, include clear disclosures of terms and conditions, including rate of interest on annualised basis, prohibit issue of unsolicited cards, ensure customer confidentiality, and also cover matters such as ‘do not call’ registry, fair practices in recovery and collection.  Revised Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006 Keeping in view the large number of complaints continuously being received against banks, the Banking Ombudsman Scheme has been revamped this year to enlarge its extent and scope of the authority and functions to specifically cover redressal of grievances against deficiency in banking services, including a variety of banking products/services, such as, loans and advances, credit cards, non-payment/ inordinate delay in the payment or collection of cheques, drafts, bills, non-issue of drafts to customers, non-adherence to prescribed working hours by branches etc. Banking Ombudsman (BO) functions as an arbitrator in respect of any dispute with mutual consent of both the parties provided that the value of the claim in such dispute does not exceed Rupees ten lakh. Under the new scheme, the complainants will be able to file their complaints in any form, including online. The complainant can appeal against the awards given by the Banking Ombudsmen.  A quick review of the complaints received at the various offices of the Ombudsman since the revised scheme came into force reveals that the number of complaints received by the BO’s offices has more than doubled to 13,483 during the quarter ended March 31, 2006. This increase could be attributed to the complainants tending to approach the Ombudsman’s office or RBI directly instead of first approaching the concerned bank’s internal machinery for redressal. There is an urgent need for banks to strengthen their own internal grievance redressal machinery and set up nodal officials at various BIS Review 57/2006 3 
centres. Banks should give wide publicity to the names/contact addresses etc. of such nodal officers so that members of public can forward their grievances to these officials. If no response is received within a month's time or if the customer is dissatisfied with the response he can approach the concerned Banking Ombudsman. Currently BO offices are functioning at 15 centres. Fair Practices Code of Indian Banks’ Association Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has also played a complementary role in efforts for improving customer service in banks. IBA had come out with model Fair Practices Code covering lenders liability, depositors’ interest that cover what a customer can expect from his bank. It also indicates the responsibilities of banks while giving different kinds of banking services. IBA has further come out with a Model Deposit Policy. The Fair Practices Code has been recently reviewed and made more comprehensive in consultation with the BCSBI and is expected to set higher benchmarks for customer services in banks. The banks will be entering into covenants with the BCSBI for adhering to the FPC.  Ensuring reasonableness of bank charges As the Reserve Bank was receiving several representations from public about unreasonable service charges being levied by banks, it was felt that the existing institutional mechanism in this regard is not adequate. Accordingly, and in order to ensure fair practices in banking services, the RBI has recently issued instructions to banks making it obligatory for them to display and continue to keep updated, in their offices/branches as also in their website, the details of various services charges in a format prescribed by it. The Reserve Bank has also decided to place details relating to service charges of individual banks for the most common services in its website. Furthermore, Reserve Bank has since constituted a working group headed by the Banking Ombudsman, Mumbai and including nominee of IBA and representatives of customers to formulate a scheme for ensuring reasonableness of bank charges and to incorporate this in the Fair Practices Code, the compliance of which will be monitored by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI).  Customer service – institutional machinery In the area of customer service, the institutional machinery in banks should comprise - • At the Board level, every bank has been asked to constitute a Customer Services committee of the Board including as invitees experts and representatives of customers to enable the bank to formulate policies and assess the compliance thereof internally. • Every bank has been asked to convert the Ad Hoc committee of executives on customer service headed by the CMD/ED into a Standing Committee that periodically reviews the policies and procedures and working of the bank’s own grievance redressal machinery. These committees have been found to be very useful as the CEO of the bank and his top management team is singularly focused on matters relating to customer services at the meetings of these committees and decisions for improving services tend to get taken instantly, cutting across different departments. • Each bank is expected to have a nodal department/ official for customer service in the HO and each controlling office, whom customers with grievances can approach in the first instance and with whom the Banking Ombudsman and RBI can liaise. More interaction between the RBI/BO and the nodal officers will enable banks to take necessary correctives at the local level.  Financial inclusion In the context of the focus on financial inclusion and distress amongst farmers, there is a need for the formal financial system to look at increasing financial literacy and financial counselling. As part of the Community Reinvestment Act in US, banks are expected to contribute towards educating persons from socially and financially disadvantaged groups on matters relating to their financial needs. Indian banks and financial market players should actively look at promoting such programs as part of their corporate social responsibility. I had recently visited a cooperative society having linkages to women 4 BIS Review 57/2006 
SHGs in urban slums, where the borrower was counselled in a full day program, on the implications of the loan, how the interest is calculated and so on, so that she is totally aware of its features. I wish the banks would have similar program for their clientele including farmers. There is clearly a lot to be done in this area.  Advisory services Finally, given the vision and mission of the Financial Planning Standards Board India, I would urge the Board to develop standards for financial advisory services covering marketing, advisory and counselling. While doing so the Board may specifically look at possible areas of conflict of interest between selling and advising. In this context, I would draw reference to a recent report on 'Conflict of interest in financial services' of a group set up by RBI, available on our website. The FPSB India could evolve codes of ethics and other measures to minimize unacceptable conflicts or improper acts.  I thank the Financial Planning Standards Board India for this opportunity and wish it success in its endeavour.  BIS Review 57/2006 5 
Randall S Kroszner: Why are yield curves so flat and long rates so low globally?  Remarks by Mr Randall S Kroszner, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Bankers' Association for Finance and Trade, New York, New York, 15 June 2006.  *      *      * Today I want to talk about some new and exciting developments in bond markets around the world. The motivation for my discussion is the current puzzling situation of a relatively flat yield curve combined with relatively low real and nominal long-term interest rates, which has occurred both in developed economies and in emerging markets. I will explore some possible explanations for the pattern and will focus on changes in the prospects for and risks to the long-term inflation outlook, particularly in emerging-market economies. In particular, I will highlight how financial innovations and international competitive pressures, combined with a better public understanding of the costs of inflation and changes in the institutions of central banking, have helped improve the credibility of central banks and inflation outcomes in many emerging markets.  Until recently, many emerging-market countries simply did not have a yield curve because there was effectively no market for debt issued in domestic currency beyond a very short horizon. The credibility of central banks has been crucial to this deepening of the domestic capital market, which is typically associated with higher economic growth. I am optimistic that these developments will continue, as I believe that the move toward low inflation rates reflects important technological and institutional factors that are likely to persist. Nevertheless, there are still risks, which underscore the importance of continuing to reap the benefits of improved central bank behavior and credibility in emerging markets and around the world. Global developments in the bond market In February 2005, former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan noted a puzzle in the U.S. economy related to the slope of the yield curve and the level of the long-term interest rate.1 Long-term interest rates had remained low and stable despite a solid economic recovery and a sustained period of monetary policy tightening during which the target federal funds rate went from 1 percent to 2-1/2 percent. When he first publicly noted this "conundrum," as he called it, the ten-year Treasury yield was just over 4 percent. Today, despite an additional 250 basis points of increase in the target federal funds rate, the nominal ten-year Treasury yield is roughly 5 percent, still very low by historical standards, compared to an average of more than 7-1/2 percent since 1980.  The combination of a rising short rate and a relatively stable long rate has led to a very flat yield curve. During the last quarter-century, for example, the difference between the yield on the ten-year Treasury note and the yield on the three-month Treasury bill has been roughly 1-3/4 percent (or, to be exact, 179 basis points from 1980 to the present). During the last year, that difference has been less than 50 basis points and is currently less than half of that. Thus, this essentially flat slope is atypical in U.S. experience.  I am sure that you are all familiar with the simple relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates. The yield on a ten-year bond, for instance, can be thought of as a series of consecutive forward rates. If you could borrow and lend at the same rate as the U.S. Treasury, then you could lock in a three-month loan ten years from now by borrowing for ten years and three months and simultaneously lending the same principal for ten years. The difference between the interest you pay and the interest you earn on this transaction determines the implied forward rate ten years from today.2 The forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate                                                       1  Alan Greenspan (2005), statement before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, presenting the Federal Reserve Board’s "Monetary Policy Report to the Congress," February 16. 2  Strictly speaking, this calculation requires the use of zero-coupon bonds, but it can be approximated using coupon securities. BIS Review 57/2006 1 
but also a "term premium" to compensate for the risk in committing to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.3At any point in time, then, we can calculate the short-term forward rate ten years ahead based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury coupon securities.4 This "far forward" rate makes the conundrum even more puzzling because it reached historically low levels of almost 4-1/4 percent last year, more than 200 basis points below its average since 1990, and has rebounded only somewhat this year. In real terms, the far forward rate calculated from inflation-indexed securities is similarly below its long run average. The U.S. bond market conundrum has occurred in parallel with similar developments in foreign bond markets. In major industrial countries, bond yields have trended down, in some cases reaching historical lows recently. Yields are also low in real terms, as measured by inflation-indexed bonds. Far-forward short rates in recent years have also reached unusually low levels in many industrial countries. The most interesting and, I believe, perhaps least studied recent developments in the bond markets concern the changes in emerging markets. While it is well known that the yield spreads on dollar-denominated bonds of emerging-market governments included in the EMBI+ index are near all time lows (even taking into account the recent rise), two phenomena in emerging markets have received less attention.  One is the development of markets for longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in local currencies. This phenomenon is, from my perspective, quite remarkable and belies the assertion that the "original sins" of bad policy from the past have doomed the development of domestic currency bond markets in many emerging markets. The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt markets has, in many cases, not only extended a yield curve but effectively created a local currency yield curve that simply did not exist earlier.  Since 2000, ten-year nominal fixed-coupon bonds in local currency have been introduced in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia, while Korea issued a ten-year fixed coupon bond in 1995. To illustrate in more detail, the governments of Mexico and Korea have been able extend the average maturity of their local-currency debt significantly in just the past few years. The Mexican government issued ten-year maturities in 2001 and then 20-year maturities in 2003. The proportion of local-currency debt in Mexico maturing within one year was nearly 90 percent in 2002 and is now below 75 percent. (I have included floating rate debt in the one-year maturity category.) The Korean government continues to increase the proportion of its domestic currency debt in longer maturities, with the one-year-and-under segment falling from roughly one-half in 1999 to one-quarter by the end of last year.  Two, bond yields in local currencies of emerging-market countries have also declined. It is perhaps not surprising that, given their high rates of saving and generally high level of economic development, the governments of Hong Kong and Korea can borrow at close to industrial-country levels. More notable, however, is that the Mexican government can borrow in pesos at a ten-year maturity at rates that have averaged roughly 9 percent. And Mexico is not unique in this regard. Other middle-income emerging markets with ten-year local-currency fixed rate bond yields in the single digits include Chile, Malaysia, Russia, and Thailand, to name but a few. For countries with longer maturities, implied short-term interest rates five years ahead also have been declining and have reached very low levels, although there have been some increases in the past few months. What is driving these changes? There are a number of complementary, not alternative, explanations. Explanations for the low real bond yields Chairman Bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global savings relative to global investment, sometimes referred to as a global savings glut, has held down real interest rates around                                                       3  Don H. Kim and Jonathan H. Wright (2005), "An Arbitrage-Free Three-Factor Term Structure Model and the Recent Behavior of Long-Term Yields and Distant-Horizon Forward Rates," Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2005-33 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August). 4  Typically we calculate an "instantaneous" forward rate, which is the limiting value of a sequence of forward rates with maturities declining toward zero. 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
the world and encouraged capital inflows to the United States.5 Some of the factors behind this savings glut include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a reduction in fiscal deficits in some Latin American countries, and a retreat in Asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s financial crises while saving rates stayed high in Asia. The savings glut story helps to explain the real component of low bond yields as well as the pattern of global capital flows, which was Chairman Bernanke’s focus. Another factor behind declining real yields in some emerging markets is that their improved fiscal situation not only increases national saving but also calms fears about the ability of governments to service their debt.  However, there is also a nominal aspect of low global bond yields. In the rest of my talk, I would like to emphasize the worldwide decline of inflation and perceived inflation risk as a key contributor to low nominal bond yields. Explanations for the low nominal bond yields Inflation rates in major industrial and developing regions have trended down over the past twenty-five years. Compared with the period 1980 to 1999, median inflation rates from 2000 to 2004 fell from 5 percent to 2 percent in industrialized countries and from 14 percent to 4-1/2 percent in emerging markets, according to the most recent statistics from the International Monetary Fund. Not long ago, annual inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico at times exceeded 100 percent. But during the past decade, Brazilian and Mexican inflation rates have remained low. In particular, inflation in Brazil did not spike up after its financial crises and sharp currency depreciations in the late 1990s. Given Brazil’s history of hyperinflation, this stability is especially remarkable. Brazil did experience a small spike of inflation around its presidential election in 2002, but even this was minor by historical standards. The pattern of low inflation is seen across many countries, large and small. A few years ago I did some research that showed how inflation rates around the world have fallen significantly since the 1970s and 1980s, both in terms of averages and medians.6 Indeed, the IMF’s April 2006 World Economic Outlook notes that average inflation rates in both the industrial countries and the developing countries in recent years are at their lowest levels since at least the early 1970s. More important, I found that the worst inflation performers (specifically the 10 percent of the countries of the world experiencing the highest inflation) had much lower inflation rates than the worst performers from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Thus, the worst behavior is not as bad as it once was. Do markets expect low inflation to persist in the long run? To answer this question, we can look at measures of expected inflation. Consensus Economics surveys hundreds of professional forecasters in numerous countries each April. The surveys allow us to examine forecasts of inflation around the world six to ten years ahead beginning in 1996. The latest observation, in April 2006, for example, is the forecast of a given country’s average consumer price inflation rate from 2012 through 2016. For both a representative sample of industrial economies (Euro area, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom) and emerging-market economies (Brazil, China, Korea, and Mexico), we observe substantial declines from the late 1990s to today. These forecasts have been low and stable in both industrial and many important developing countries in recent years. The surveys thus provide one indication that markets do expect low inflation to persist. The volatility of inflation has also declined notably, suggesting that perceived inflation risk may have declined as well. For the industrial countries, inflation volatility (measured as a twenty-quarter rolling standard deviation of consumer price inflation) has declined from the 1980s to the 1990s to the period since 2000. Although it has since drifted up just a bit due to volatility in oil prices, it remains at or near its lowest level in the last quarter-century. For the emerging markets, the decline in volatility is even more dramatic. Brazil, in particular, was off the chart much of the time before the late 1990s. Volatility of inflation in China, Korea, and Mexico is now at levels similar to those of the industrial countries, and volatility in Brazil is not much higher.                                                        5  Ben S.

Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation around the world has led to a reduction in inflation expectations and lower perceived inflation risk, hence a lower inflation uncertainty premium in long rates. I believe that these factors have been important contributors to the lower long-term yields and the flattening of yield curves, particularly in emerging markets. The existence of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.  Factors behind the global move to price stability Four broad factors lie behind the move to price stability, especially in emerging markets, and these factors tend to reinforce each other. Each factor affects the cost-benefit tradeoff of pursuing a high-inflation policy. The first factor, which gets surprisingly little attention in my view, is financial innovation that alters the ability and incentive of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.7 I put the innovations into two main categories, developments in information technology and physical dollarization, both of which effectively increase potential competition among currencies. Financial innovations make it easier for citizens to move their assets out of the local currency should their government resort to an inflation tax. The dollarizations that followed the high-inflation episodes in Latin America and the former Soviet Union, for example, significantly reduced the costs of switching away from a local currency for small-value transactions. The specific channels by which financial innovations could have affected competition among currencies are many:  • Electronic trading and payments technologies enabled investors and banks to shift assets quickly away from currencies prone to inflation and related risks. In the 1990s, many countries - including Brazil, Korea, and Mexico - implemented real-time gross settlement payment systems, which allowed markets to rapidly settle payments and other obligations with finality during the day.  • Financial innovations such as credit card networks and money market mutual funds allow households and firms to minimize their holdings of cash and central bank reserves, thus shrinking the base of the inflation tax.  • Increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions without holding inflationary currency. Data published on the Federal Reserve’s website show a dramatic increase in the fraction of U.S. Federal Reserve notes that are estimated to be held in foreign countries. The fraction of U.S. Federal Reserve notes held abroad rose from under 20 percent in 1980 to almost 50 percent in the late 1990s.  Given these innovations, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit for each unit increase in inflation because people can more easily switch out of the local currency. In other words, the inflation tax becomes much more difficult and costly to levy because citizens can more easily avoid the tax by using an alternative money. The second and closely related factor behind disinflation is deregulation and competition in a globalized marketplace. The collapse of the centrally-planned economies has led many countries to turn increasingly to private markets to deliver growth and progress and reduce the role of government. Technology has helped to increase global competition by shrinking the barriers of time and distance. Again, there are several channels by which globalization and competition may have affected the cost-benefit tradeoff in pursing inflation: • As Kenneth Rogoff pointed out at the 2003 Jackson Hole conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, greater competition leads to more-flexible prices.8 When prices are more flexible, a central bank’s ability to temporarily influence output is diminished while its influence on inflation is enhanced. Thus, more-competitive markets naturally help central banks achieve price stabilization.                                                        7  I discussed aspects of this factor in my presentation at a May 2001 conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, cited above. 8  Kenneth S. Rogoff (2003), "Globalization and Global Disinflation," in Monetary Policy and Uncertainty: Adapting to a Changing Economy: A Symposium (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Aug. 28–30), pp. 77–112.  4 BIS Review 57/2006 
• Increased travel has expanded the opportunities for citizens to set up financial accounts in foreign countries, thereby contributing to currency competition in a manner similar to financial innovation.  • Satellite television and the internet have heightened public awareness of conditions abroad, educated citizens about financial opportunities elsewhere, and raised pressure on politicians not to place limits on these opportunities.  • Deregulation of the financial sector spurs the types of financial innovation that I have already discussed and allows for more cross-border flows and greater competition among different types of currencies and assets.  The third factor is that economists and the public have learned from painful experience about the costs of inflation.9 The end of the Bretton Woods gold standard in the early 1970s was associated with the first global and sustained peacetime inflation in history. Although the specific experiences differed across countries, public opinion eventually turned strongly against allowing inflation to continue, and policymakers responded to this pressure by taking stronger measures to achieve price stability. This learning process helped to drive some of the financial innovations that I discussed earlier, which, in turn, helped households and businesses to economize on holding inflationary assets. Economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.  The fourth factor I wish to mention relates to changes in the institutions of central banking that may have increased the costs of pursuing high-inflation policies. The most notable change is the increased independence of many central banks and the corresponding reduced control of the fiscal authorities over monetary policy. Central bank independence reduces the ability of a government to "raid the cookie jar" through a surprise inflation tax. In most cases, central bank independence can be reversed by a majority vote of parliament. But having to resort to such a vote is a greater obstacle to inflationary finance than previous arrangements allowed, especially given the public’s increased sensitivity and aversion to inflation. Central bank independence has typically been granted in conjunction with an explicit mandate that makes achieving low and stable inflation one of the goals of monetary policy. Central bank independence with a mandate that includes price stability increases the credibility of monetary policy with regard to achieving low inflation. Policy is credible because the central bank’s objectives are clear to the public and the central bank can be held accountable for failing to achieve its objectives.  When citizens are more aware of the costs of inflation and when governments would reap lower benefits from a high-inflation policy, institutional reforms that will make central banks more credible and independent may be more likely to be adopted and sustained.10 The fundamental forces I mentioned earlier - financial innovation, deregulation, globalization, and public understanding about the costs of inflation - provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the political path to institutional reforms, such as central bank independence, that enhance central bank credibility. Once in place, these reforms made further progress against inflation easier and raised the costs of backsliding. As the benefits of stable prices accrue and as financial markets deepen and become more sophisticated, the benefits of sound economic policies will help to create support for institutional reforms that make returning to inflation harder for future governments.                                                        9  This hypothesis was raised in the discussion of Rogoff (2003). See Guillermo Ortíz, chair, "General Discussion: Globalization and Global Disinflation," in Monetary Policy and Uncertainty: Adapting to a Changing Economy: A Symposium (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Aug. 28–30), pp. 119–130. For evidence that voters in Latin America have punished politicians for bad inflation outcomes in recent years, see Eduardo Lora and Mauricio Oliveira (2005), "The Electoral Consequences of the Washington Consensus," Economía, vol. 5 (Spring), pp. 1–61. 10  In a paper with Douglas Irwin, I documented a similar dynamic at work in the gradual reversal of protectionist policies in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s. See Douglas A. Irwin and Randall S. Kroszner (1999), "Interests, Institutions, and Ideology in Securing Policy Change: The Republican Conversion to Trade Liberalization after Smoot-Hawley," Journal of Law and Economics, vol. 42 (October), pp. 643–73.

Benefits of price stability While it is well known that low and stable inflation improves the environment for investment planning and avoids many costs and disruptions associated with frequent price adjustments, I want to focus on a few of the many benefits that are particularly relevant for emerging markets. Price stability boosts growth through deepening financial markets. With stable prices, savers and investors have more confidence about the ultimate value of their deposits and loans. Stable prices encourage the growth of financial intermediaries and financial markets. As noted above, many emerging markets have recently experienced a deepening of their local financial markets with greater issuance of longer-dated paper. According to numerous studies, there is a strong link between financial market development and economic growth. Thus, the greater credibility of central banks that permits more development of the local markets can have an economic benefit beyond the financial sector.11The development of long-term local-currency bond markets may also help governments and firms plan long-term infrastructure and investment projects that boost economic development. Although such debt markets are only one of many factors that can lower the costs of long-term planning and enhance the ability to undertake long-term investments, the development of these markets, particularly when accompanied by lower real rates, help to support longer-horizon projects and reduce the effect of foreign exchange movements on such activities. A better fiscal outlook, which might arise from higher and more stable growth as well as better long-term planning, also increases financial market confidence and development and thus further boosts growth and reinforces prospects for continued price stability. This virtuous cycle appears to be happening in key emerging markets that were long plagued with poor fiscal situations, such as Brazil and Mexico. In the 1980s and early 1990s, for example, public sector deficits in these countries often exceeded 10 percent of GDP. Since the late 1990s, deficits have been diminished. Maintaining this progress Although I am an optimist, I would be remiss if I did not point out some risks to this otherwise rosy scenario. The difficulty of reaching agreement in the Doha Round of trade negotiations highlights the risk of renewed protectionism. Trade barriers reduce both domestic and international competition, one of the key factors behind low inflation, and make all countries poorer. Barriers to free flow of goods, services, and capital would also diminish the force of other factors outlined above that help to reduce inflationary pressures. We must not forget the examples of high inflation and hyperinflation from the past: They hold important lessons about the costs of not maintaining price stability. That sound policies are the basis for solid economic growth should not be forgotten.                                                       11  See Ross Levine (2005), "Finance and Growth: Theory and Evidence," Philippe Aghion and Steven Durlauf, eds., Handbook of Economic Growth (New York: Elsevier); and Randall S.

Toshihiko Fukui: Financial markets and the real economy in a low Interest rate environment Opening speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the 13th International Conference hosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, Tokyo, 1 June 2006. *      *      * 1. Introduction Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to address the 13th international conference hosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies. On behalf of my colleagues at the Bank of Japan, I welcome all the participants from all over the world.  2.  Theme of this year's conference The theme of this year's conference is "Financial Markets and the Real Economy in a Low Interest Rate Environment." I am sure that this theme is timely for all of us, considering the financial and real economic conditions we have faced since the 1990s. Let me elaborate on this point, focusing on Japan's experience with quantitative easing. 3.  Japan's experience with quantitative easing Since the 1990s, Japanese firms and banks have continued their adjustment efforts. Specifically, Japanese firms have tackled the so-called "three excesses," that is, the excesses of debt, employment, and production capacity, since the bursting of the economic bubble in the early 1990s. Japanese banks suffered from a massive non-performing loan problem, which plagued the stability of the financial system. In addition, around 2000, the collapse of the so-called IT bubble around the globe placed Japan's economy once more in a recessionary phase. In these circumstances, the economy faced the risk of falling into a deflationary spiral. Once the economy falls into such a vicious spiral, it is very hard to get out of it, since expectations of continuing deflation can be self-reinforcing.  To prevent the vicious spiral, the Bank acted decisively by introducing the quantitative easing policy. The quantitative easing policy had two pillars: (1) provision of ample liquidity by the Bank with the adoption of the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank as the operating target for money market operations; and (2) a commitment by the Bank to continue to provide ample liquidity "until the consumer price index (CPI, excluding fresh food) registers stably a zero percent or an increase year on year." This policy package exerted significant influences on the overall interest rate environment. Specifically, the provision of ample liquidity drove the uncollateralized overnight call rate, which should reflect credit risks of borrower financial institutions, lower to 0.001 percent under the quantitative easing. In addition, the commitment to continue zero interest rates substantially flattened the yield curve. The strong effects of the quantitative easing policy on financial markets are very clear if we compare them with the U.S. situation in the 1930s. During the 1930s, although the U.S. Treasury bill rate declined to approximately zero percent, the federal funds rate, the rate at which financial institutions lend and borrow short-term funds, declined only to 0.25 percent. Moreover, the yields on government bonds have been much lower in Japan from the mid-1990s onward than they were in the United States of the 1930s. Thus, we can infer that the quantitative easing policy was one of the most decisive policy challenges for central banks from a historical perspective. In retrospect, Japan's economy finally started recovering in January 2002 after the strenuous efforts by firms and banks to resolve their problems that I have mentioned. As an aside, it was on March 20, 2003 that I assumed the office of Governor. At that time, the fact that Japan's economy had already started recovering was beyond my widest dreams. In my inaugural address, I mentioned that Japan's economy was still on shaky ground. BIS Review 56/2006  1
Subsequently, the Bank stepped up the quantitative easing further by increasing the current account balances at the Bank far above the required reserves, as well as abiding by the CPI commitment. Also, in October 2003, the Bank provided a more detailed description of the commitment to maintain the quantitative easing policy from the perspective of enhancing the transparency of monetary policy. During this, we always kept in mind that we should carefully nurture the budding economic recovery. The quantitative easing policy showed visible effects on two fronts. First, the policy, particularly through the ample liquidity provision, stabilized the financial system, at a time when there were strong concerns over its stability. The ample liquidity the Bank supplied met the surges in financial institutions' liquidity demand, and thus successfully avoided a repetition of the large-scale credit crunch that was observed in 1997 and 1998.  Second, the quantitative easing policy created and maintained a very accommodative environment that supported the recovery of Japanese firms, through the commitment to continue zero interest rates. In particular, bank lending rates and interest rates on corporate bonds continued to decline as a result of the flattening of the yield curve, as well as the gradual decline in credit risk premiums. Various potential transmission channels of the quantitative easing were discussed among economists at the time the Bank introduced the policy. One of these channels is the portfolio rebalance channel: as the proportion of safe assets such as the current account balances at the Bank increases in the asset portfolios of financial institutions, they are expected to adjust their portfolios, typically by increasing holdings of riskier assets such as loans. Looking back on the period under the quantitative easing policy, we are not yet sure whether this channel actually worked or not. The accommodative environment contributed finally to putting the economy back onto a solid recovery path. The year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI rose to the surface in October 2005 and turned positive the following month.  Under these circumstances, the Bank decided to terminate the quantitative easing policy in March 2006. More specifically, the Bank decided to change the operating target for money market operations from the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank to the uncollateralized overnight call rate. Under the new scheme, the Bank currently encourages the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent.  During the period of the adjustment process, Japanese firms have been innovating continuously to strengthen their competitiveness. They have also expanded the global supply-chain network with a particular emphasis on developing their strategic linkages with Asian counterparts. Meanwhile, the Japanese banks have overcome the non-performing loan problem and are currently better positioned to respond to the demands for sophisticated financial services of the times. Such revitalization of both firms and banks should improve the efficiency of the market mechanism, thereby enabling a better allocation of resources.  4.  Several questions to be discussed In what follows, let me raise several questions that I hope are discussed at this conference.  First, how have financial markets functioned in the historically low interest rate environment? Have any unexpected effects of the low interest rate policy been detected in the financial markets? Second, has the interaction between financial markets and the real economy changed in a low interest rate environment? For instance, have the roles played by financial markets and asset prices in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy changed? Third, what are the consequences of a prolonged low interest rate environment? In particular, does the low interest rate policy pose potential risks to both financial markets and the real economy? Fourth, how can we evaluate the recent low interest rate policy from historical and international perspectives? For instance, can we derive policy implications by comparing our recent policy experiences with the past episodes of combating deflation such as the 1930s in the United States?  5.  Final words There are no easy answers to these questions. During the next two days, I am looking forward to learning from both prominent scholars in this field and central bankers their analyses and perspectives  BIS Review 56/2006 2 
on the "Financial Markets and the Real Economy in a Low Interest Rate Environment." I also hope the insights gained at the conference will be of some help to the future generations of central bankers. It would be our utmost pleasure if every one of you could obtain some insights from the discussions that follow. Thank you. BIS Review 56/2006  3
Vitor Constâncio: Finance and regulation  Remarks by Mr Vitor Constâncio, Governor of the Bank of Portugal, at the European Association for Banking and Financial History, Lisbon, 26 May 2006. *      *      * It is indeed a pleasure to participate in this panel at the beginning of a Conference that introduces an historical perspective on the important subject of the relationship between the State and Financial Services. History helps us to put into perspective the successive waves of regulation and deregulation that have marked that delicate relationship. Financial activity, and banking activity in particular, has been subject to different types of regulation since the banking crises of previous centuries convinced authorities of that need. In general, finance is a process that produces and exchanges stores of value in order to facilitate intertemporal decisions of saving and investment. Normally, finance implies giving up liquidity in the present for the promise of future returns. So, it’s an activity that is intrinsically burdened with uncertainty as it implies trust and expectations about the future. It is also an activity essential for economic life as it opens new opportunities for society to invest and increase productivity. As it grew in complexity the systemic risk involved introduces an element of public good considerations. It is therefore understandable that it became an activity subject to public regulation, monitoring and supervision. The rationale for regulation rests on two types of justifications: first, the important externalities associated with the systemic role of the financial sector and second, the nature of an activity where asymmetries of information create the possibility of some market failures [see Llewellyn (1999) for a good analysis of the issues]1  History shows that regulation and supervision of the financial sector evolved in response to crisis or major episodes of turbulence. Robert Gordon (2005) has shown for instance in a recent paper2 that one of the differences between the 20’s and the 90’s that help to explain why financial crises had milder consequences in the latest decade is the existence of stronger regulation and supervision (capital requirements, deposit insurance etc). In fact, one of the features of the more recent decades has been a remarkable decrease in volatility of the real economy in spite of some episodes like the 97/98 Far East and Russian crisis and the demise in 2000 of the previous exuberant boom. These shocks seem to contradict the theory that it was the reduction of shocks that explain the noted reduced volatility of recent decades. More likely explanations are to be found in the flurry of financial innovations that generalized risk-based pricing and the supply of many new credit instruments that helped to finance economic activity even in unfavourable times. A second set of reasons includes better public policies, from improved supervision to monetary policy. Monetary policy in particular has been successful in providing an environment of stability and its enhanced focus on transparency and in anchoring expectations has helped to reduce risk premiums. This more flattering view of the contribution of monetary authorities does not preclude the controversies surrounding the relationship between monetary and financial stability, a subject I will address later.  In spite of the positive effects of modern finance in contributing to the development and stability of economic activity there is an increasing concern with financial stability as an objective of policy. Practically all major Central Banks now publish special Reports on Financial Stability making clear that they see it as something that falls within there sphere of competence. There is some ambiguity about the definition of financial stability but two main meanings stand out. One, more fundamental, follows Mishkin (1991)3 and defines financial stability as a situation where the financial system is able to ensure in a lasting way, and without major disruptions, an efficient allocation of savings to investment opportunities. In another sense, financial stability refers to absence of a major misalignment of asset prices that can threaten future disruption of markets and the real economy. Both meanings are of course connected as they point to the same notion of smooth function of financial institutions and markets.                                                        1  Llewellyn, David (1999) “The economic rationale for Financial Regulation” FSA Occasional Paper Series n. 1 2  Gordon, Robert (2005) “The 1920s and the 1990s in Mutual Reflection” NBER Working Paper n. 11778 3  Mishkin, Frederic S. (1991) “Anatomy of financial crisis” NBER Working Paper n. 3934 BIS Review 56/2006  1
To justify the recent concerns with financial stability we can list both short term reasons and some more structural factors. The first ones are the so-called global imbalances and the risks associated with a possible reversal of asset price developments in various markets that may create turbulence detrimental to the real economy. The first issue has been much discussed but despite the possibility of a disrupted correction there are still reasons to hope that the winding down of both situations can happen in a gradual and orderly manner.  There are nevertheless more structural reasons for the preoccupation of supervisors and monetary authorities with financial stability. These are related with the new developments and structural changes in the financial sector that generate new causes of concern and possibly justify new regulation or increased monitoring.  Four aspects are particularly relevant from this perspective:  1. There has been a significant expansion of the financial sector in the past decades well above the growth rate of the real economy. The financial sector became more important and more complex and ensuring its stability became consequently more essential.  2. The sector changed in the direction of being more market-based with a reduced role for traditional relationship banking. Technological developments in ITC, the greater availability of information, the standardization of financial contracts, all contributed to a sort a ‘commodification’ of financial transactions. This has implied that monetary institutions and monetary aggregates have lost weight in the total of financial assets, meaning that leverage over the monetary base has increased continuously. Also, it is important to underline that this expansion was accompanied by a greater share of a non-regulated segment including hedge funds, private equity institutions etc. 3. Financial innovation produced new products and tailored new securities to particular needs in terms of maturity, risk and liquidity. The complexity of derivatives and structured products grows all the time as well as the size of derivatives markets. The more recent example is of course the phenomenal growth of the market for credit derivatives. Credit Default Swaps (CDS), Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO), Credit-linked notes, credit spread options and other products developed into a market that represents now more than 16 trillion euros and is bigger than the total stock of existing corporate bonds and loans. These instruments fulfil useful functions by allowing the transfer of risk, isolating and pricing pure credit risk, providing liquidity to individual credits in times of stress and improving the management of risk for various institutions etc. They create at the same time new sources of risk due to their complexity, the uncertainty of mark-to-model valuations not tested in times of trouble specially when secondary markets are not very liquid in general.  4. The fourth aspect deserving mentioning refers to the growing interdependence of markets across types of products, across institutions and across borders. The more market-based financial system continues to depend from monetary institutions for the provision of liquidity and credit lines. Markets for different types of assets tend to depend from common factors and show co-movement of returns. This greater interconnectedness is an element that creates the so-called ‘endogenous’ component of risk, i.e. system-wide risk that is created by the financial sector itself as the result of market participants’ collective behaviour and its effects on the main sources of risk. The increased concentration of institutions in various markets also adds to the effects of this ‘endogenous’ risk  The main drivers of these structural changes were of course technological progress and the movements of liberalization and globalization. The regulation system has responded to these changes and evolved as turbulent episodes were occurring. Following the crisis of 97/98 there was a general enhancement of regulation and supervision of the financial sector. New International Codes and Standards were developed by the BIS, the IMF, IOSCO and IAIS. The preparation of a new Capital Accord was initiated and its recent approval will change the standard for capital requirements in a direction more sensitive to risk than the previous Basel I framework. In Europe, the mandatory implementation of new International Accounting Standards introduced changes, not always welcomed, in the reporting of financial institutions with consequences for prudential aspects. Another important development has been the improved sophistication of a macro-prudential function developed by Central Banks, Supervisors and International Institutions to analyse and monitor all the major risks at the level of the system as a whole. The use of models of the financial sector allows the simulation of various shocks to conduct stress tests at that level.   BIS Review 56/2006 2 
Despite all these improvements the question remains if some further changes are required in regulation and supervision of the system in view of the new problems and risks created by the recent structural changes. Before venturing an opinion let me stress again the positive aspects, including for stability, that stem from those changes.  One general consideration was well described by Alan Greenspan (1999): “Multiple alternatives to transform an economy's savings into capital investment act as backup facilities should the primary form of intermediation fail.”4 This substitution between different segments of the financial system help to smooth overall financial flows which contributes to lower volatility in the real economy. Some empirical and theoretical evidence has been accumulated that documents that feature of the financial architecture [see Peres Jorge (2005)]5In the same direction of contributing to the efficiency and stability of the system goes the diversification of instruments that open new opportunities to finance different types of activity subject to diverse contingencies in different phases of the cycle. This adds to the effectiveness of the system to foster growth.  Finally, it is worth stressing that the new features of the financial system imply a significant progress in the management of risk. The instruments of risk transfer allowed the entry of new players in the market that enhances the absorption of credit risk although it remains difficult to assess where the risk will end up in case of a general situation of stress.  This last point is just a first element of a series of new problems that we face as a result of those structural changes experienced by the system. That particular one is specially related to the credit derivatives market. This new market has been the source of uneasiness due the possibility of operational risk and liquidity problems. Even the positive aspect of risk diversification that is fostered by markets for Asset Based Securities and Collateralized Debt Obligations should not be misinterpreted as, for instance, the existence of ‘first loss’ tranches that stay as responsibilities of the originator banks cannot be ignored. Those practices imply that banks keep the riskier part of the securitised portfolio and it should also be remembered that the transfer of risk allows the banks to take other risks that they feel they have some advantage in managing. It is then not clear if the end result means a reduction of risk for the banking system as a whole.  Another cause of concern is related with the increased ‘endogenous risk’ already mentioned and that is very difficult to measure and to monitor, as Malcolm Knight (2004)6 has stressed. An additional point refers to the fact that improvements in the managing of risk have made possible the assumption of new risks sometimes difficult to evaluate. The appearance and expansion of a segment of non-regulated institutions, hedge funds in particular, that have been responsible for the significant increase of financial activity has been other source of some unease.  A last point worth mentioning has been an increase of the usual pro-cyclicality of the financial system. This is a consequence of some of the structural changes already mentioned, but some regulatory changes may have also contributed to exacerbate that tendency. Basel II, in spite of some adjustments attempting to mitigate this effect, has been mentioned in this connection as the closer association of regulatory capital to risk assessment will tend ceateris paribus to reduce capital requirements in boom periods as ratings improve, the opposite being the case in periods of economic slowdown. Another contributor to this pro-cyclicality may have been the introduction of the International Accounting Standards that generalises the use of fair value accounting. The generalized use of mark-to-market or mark-to-model of assets and liabilities increases the volatility of the accounts of financial institutions. The important point though is the effect that this may have on market prices themselves. As stressed in a recent paper by Plantin, Sabra and Shin (2005):7 “…marking to market tends to amplify the movements in asset prices relative to their fundamental values in bad states of the world…. Under the historical cost regime, actions of the firms are strategic substitutes. Sales by the other firms drive the market price down, which makes holding the asset booked at the acquisition cost                                                       4  Greenspan, Alan (1999) “Do efficient financial markets mitigate financial crises?” Before the 1999 Financial Markets Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Sea Island, Georgia October 19, 1999 5  Jorge, José Peres (2005) Financial System Architecture: the role of systemic risk, added value and liquidity, CEMPRE, Faculdade de Economia, Universidade do Porto 6  Knight, Malcolm (2004) “Markets and Institutions: Managing the evolving financial risk” BIS 7  Guillaume Plantin, Haresh Sapra and Hyun Song Shin (2005) “Marking-to-Market: Panacea or Pandora’s Box?” mimeo BIS Review 56/2006  3
more desirable. Conversely, in the mark-to-market regime, firm’s actions are strategic complements. The expectation of sales by the other firms makes holding the asset less desirable because of an expected low market value at the reporting date. Strategic substitutability has a stabilizing effect, so that the market price is artificially smooth as compared to the true value of the asset under the historical cost measurement regime. Strategic complementarity adds endogenous volatility, so that the market prices are artificially volatile as compared to the fundamental values in a marked-to-market economy”.  All the aspects I have been enumerating contribute, among other things, to increase volatility in asset prices and possible episodes of significant misalignment. This prospect is certainly a cause of uneasiness for monetary and financial authorities.  From this standpoint it is interesting to examine two views that seek to identify general factors behind the tendency for asset price volatility. The first approach has been developed in the BIS research, in particular by Claudio Borio and Philip Lowe (2002)8. The main idea is that under present circumstances monetary stability is not enough by itself to ensure financial stability and may even contribute to unstable prices of financial assets. This contradiction would stem from the very success of monetary authorities in guaranteeing price stability in a credible way. The coexistence of an environment of low interest rates with future inflation expectations well anchored in the low levels defined by central banks objectives, would allow credit expansion that would fuel asset prices increases. If valid, this view would be very disquieting to central bankers because the traditional view has been exactly the opposite, i.e., that stability of prices of goods and services would stimulate market participants to concentrate on the real factors that affect the fundamentals of valuation of financial assets thus contributing to low volatility in their respective markets. This view, which is certainly basically valid from a long term perspective, is nevertheless not incompatible with the possibility that a short term trade-off may exist between monetary and financial stability. That may be the case in particular in periods of transition after a long period of disinflation or when monetary policy starts to change the interest rate cycle after a long period of low rates. Central Banks do not ignore this possibility and take into consideration financial stability issues for which they feel responsible which explains why they usually embark into interest rate smoothing and manage turning points of policy at a measured pace.  It should be stressed that the existence of that short-term trade-off may create significant problems to the inflation targeting monetary policy regime that is widely used nowadays. Being by definition very much attached to targets and forecasts for inflation as an almost exclusive basis for decisions, that framework has difficulty in incorporating other considerations into the decision-making process without loosing some credibility. The notion that this could be overcome by extending the horizon of the inflation forecast by a number of years does not look realistic and has not been attempted.  Turning to empirical considerations it is difficult reach a conclusion on the relevance of this view about the short-term trade-off between monetary and financial stability for the behaviour of asset prices in the recent past. On the other hand, the theoretical debate about the need of integrating or not asset prices objectives in monetary policy strategies is also still going on and I will not try to address it here9. Let me just state that “it is possible that monetary policy suffers from an endemic asymmetry, being efficient to deal with the aftermath of financial crisis, but unsafe or ineffective to fight asset inflation. Nevertheless, the more traditional asymmetry attributed to monetary policy, the one that considers it to be more successful to control inflation than recessions, was never an obstacle to its use for both purposes. In the same vein, one could argue that even without defining precise targets, interest rate policy, in certain circumstances, should “lean against the wind” when it blows too strongly in asset markets. In any case, the elusive search for anchors that could help to achieve both monetary and financial stability will continue, and monetary policy cannot ignore the problem.” (Constancio, 2002)10                                                      8  Claudio Borio and Philip Lowe (2002) “ Asset prices, Financial and Monetary stability, exploring the nexus” BIS working paper no 114 9  About this debate see the contributions of Andrew Crockett, Roger Ferguson and Otmar Issing in “ Monetary stability, financial  stability and the business cycle: five views” BIS Papers no 18, 2003 10  Constancio, Vitor (2002) “Policies and institutions for global financial stability” in 8th International Financial and Economic Forum,  Vienna November 2002  BIS Review 56/2006 4 
The second broad view trying to provide a general explanation for the recent instability of asset price has been put forward by Raghuram Rajan (2005),11 the IMF chief economist, in a recent noted paper. What came to be known as the “Rajan risk” is linked with the structure of incentives of managers and institutions in the new financial environment. The gain of importance of market-based non-regulated institutions and the reduced weight of traditional banking, gives prominence to compensation schemes more linked to returns which induces managers to incur into riskier transactions. Second, performances in these growing sector of “investment institutions” tends to be measured essentially against peers which fosters the herd behaviour already present in financial markets.  Both types of behaviour increase the probability of episodes of asset prices misalignments. The system tends to assume more risks, including the so-called tail risk where probabilities are low but losses can be high. Who would have thought some years ago that pensions funds and insurance companies would become participants in the market for risk of default of other firms? On the other hand, hedge funds manage nowadays five times more assets than in 1998 and are involved in less liquid markets. Also their returns have become more correlated across supposed different types of funds which seems to indicate that they could be subject to the same type of risks in a period of tighter credit and stressful equity markets.  From all this the question that emerges is to determine if some new regulations are necessary or could be helpful at this stage. We should always be cautious about introducing new regulations and an evaluation of their costs must always be considered against their possible merits. Also, a thorough dialogue with the sector has to be conducted to determine what can really work in practice and is compatible with the incentives of institutions to comply with the rules. Also, the alternative route of relying in more disclosure of information by the institutions themselves and of creating the conditions for better market discipline should always be considered. This could be, for instance, the approach to adopt in the case of hedge funds as there seems to exist internationally great reluctance in introducing regulation and supervision in that segment. The arguments for that are based on the idea that public policies are not justified to protect sophisticated investors, but that tends to forget the system-wide role that those institutions now play with possible systemic consequences.  More generally, Rajan makes the proposal that market institutions should be encouraged to impose the practice of requiring managers to have some of their own wealth invested for several years in the funds they manage. Nevertheless, he mentions immediately that: “This is clearly, again, no panacea – the managers of LTCM did have substantial stakes in their enterprise…”  The idea put forward by Charles Goodhart (2005)12 that capital requirements should be indexed to developments of asset prices (e.g. regulatory capital for housing credit would increase as property prices rises) is interesting but would also be of limited effect and would apply only to supervised banks.  If the idea of imposing mandatory disclosure of more information by the new non-regulated institutions is not followed, authorities will have to rely on enhanced market discipline through the indirect route of putting more pressure on the supervised entities that provide liquidity and credit lines to the new ‘investment institutions’. So, as always, we will have to wait for the system to be tested in order to see if regulations will have to be adjusted again to the new financial structures.  Let me finalize with some remarks let me address the issue of the role that Central Banks should have in relation to financial stability, even when they don’t have the responsibility for supervision. In the first place, they should improve what they already do in the field of macro-prudential analysis. Besides publishing Financial Stability Reports, the authorities normally conduct top-down stress tests to assess the resilience of the system to various shocks. In this context, new progress has to be made to improve the methodologies to model the financial sector and its interaction with the economy. Also, more international cooperation in this field of macro-prudential activities would be most welcomed.  Second, in conducting monetary policy they should not loose sight of financial stability issues, specially in what regards turning points in managing the interest rate cycle and, in general, by                                                       11  Rajan, Raghuram G.

considering from a long term perspective what may be the effects of possible financial instability on price stability, which is of course their main mission.  Finally, Central Banks should participate actively with their research departments in the efforts to understand better the way modern finance operates and may create risks for the economy, with particular emphasis on modelling the feedback effects that occurs between the real economy and the financial sector behaviour. Understanding is certainly a necessary first step to avoid mistakes and overcome the difficulties that monetary and financial authorities encounter in fulfilling their mission. As a great scientist once said: “To be able to formulate the questions is to answer them”. One could only wish that the same would also be true about solving them in real life….

Rakesh Mohan: Monetary policy and exchange rate frameworks - the Indian experience  Presentation by Mr Rakesh Mohan, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Second High Level Seminar on Asian Financial Integration organised by the International Monetary Fund and Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore, 25 May 2006. The assistance of Michael Patra, Himanshu Joshi, Rajib Das and Partha Ray in preparation of the address is gratefully acknowledged. The references for this speech can be found on the Reserve Bank of India’s website www.rbi.org.in. *      *      * I would like to congratulate the International Monetary Fund and Monetary Authority of Singapore for holding this Second High Level Seminar on Asian Financial Integration. This forum provides a good opportunity for all of us to exchange notes, ideas and views on the continuously evolving texture of the international financial architecture, particular as it affects Asia and as Asian financial growth itself impacts the rest of the world. The international financial landscape today is clearly much more complex than it has been in previous decades. In each of our countries monetary policy making has become a delicate balancing act between the imperatives of domestic economic, financial and monetary concerns and the evolving international situation that we have to observe closely on a real time basis and to take it as a given. The rapid changes that technological change, financial innovation and globalisation have brought to financial markets are also forces at work that have to be taken account of. We are all living through interesting times, but our job as central bankers is perhaps to make the world less interesting through the implementation of policies that ensure monetary and financial stability! Indian economic reforms that have been in process now for a decade and a half seem to have propelled us to a higher growth path of 8 per cent plus GDP growth. Our challenge in monetary policy making now is to ensure that such a growth path can be preserved, or further accelerated, while we provide a macro-economic environment that is characterised by monetary, price and financial stability. As I will document further, among the changes that we have gone through in the last decade and a half, a key transformation is the increasing openness of the Indian economy. Within that, our economic relationships with the rest of Asia are also intensifying through sustained expansion in trade and hence in financial relationships as well. Given the emerging economic demographics in the world, and the shifting economic weight towards Asia, we are very conscious of the need for increasing integration in Asia and how our own role will evolve in the coming years. Each of the Asian countries has experienced significant changes in the operation of monetary policy in an open economy framework in recent years. Whereas we do face many similar problems, particularly through the impact of international developments such as the international crude oil price hikes, domestic developments continue to carry greater weight in most of our economies in our monetary and macro-economic management approaches. I, therefore, thought that the best thing that I can do today to facilitate discussion is to provide a brief description and evaluation of India's experience as we have implemented significant structural changes in the framework of monetary and exchange rate management in an increasingly market oriented and open economy. I. Changes in the monetary policy framework In the aftermath of a balance of payments crisis in 1991, stabilization was undertaken simultaneously with structural reforms over wide areas of the Indian economy. This dramatic change in context fundamentally altered the manner in which monetary policy began to be formulated.  First, given the reality of multiple goals assigned to the monetary authority, the achievement of macroeconomic and price stability received greater emphasis. Thus the overall objective has had to be approached in a flexible and time variant manner with a continuous rebalancing of priority between growth and price stability, depending on underlying macroeconomic and financial conditions. As we observed the severe costs of financial instability elsewhere, financial stability has ascended the hierarchy of monetary policy objectives since the second half of the 1990s. Strong synergies and complementarities are observed between price stability and financial stability in India. Accordingly, we BIS Review 56/2006  1
believe that regulation, supervision and development of the financial system remain within the legitimate ambit of monetary policy broadly interpreted. Second, the operating framework of monetary policy underwent a transformation during the 1990s. A variety of administered interventions in interest rates and bank credit flow characteristic of the 1970s and 1980s gave way in the early 1990s to a brief period of broad monetary policy rules or ‘monetary targeting with feedback’. From the second half of the 1990s, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) switched to a multiple indicator approach in which high frequency and low frequency indicators are tracked and the information used to draw policy perspectives.  Third, the growing market orientation of monetary policy has tilted the choice of instruments decisively from direct to more indirect and market-based monetary policy measures. On the eve of reforms, statutory pre-emptions in the form of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) requirements locked away nearly 70 per cent of bank deposits, severely eroding the profitability of the financial system and effectiveness of monetary policy. The SLR was brought down from 38.5 per cent of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) in early 1992 to 25 per cent in mid -1994. The CRR has been progressively reduced to 5 per cent from 15 per cent in 1991. Fourth, interest rate deregulation was initiated across different segments. In September 1990, all sector-specific and use specific interest rate prescriptions were abolished except for loans below Rs.200,000 which were subject to a minimum rate prescription. In October 1994, the minimum rate prescription was withdrawn and the lending rates of banks were made free subject to the setting of the prime lending rate (PLR). In 2003, banks were advised to announce a benchmark PLR to transparently reflect actual cost of funds. At present, banks enjoy the flexibility of pricing loans and advances using market benchmarks and time varying spreads in an objective and transparent manner. Interest rates on a number of loans and advances, including advances for acquiring residential properties, purchase of consumer durables and the like are determined without reference to the benchmark PLR. Although, savings bank deposit rates continue to be regulated, by 1995, rates on term deposits with maturities of over two years were freed. In the following year, rates on deposits of over one year maturity were freed. By October 1997, the ceiling on rates on deposits of thirty days to one year maturity period was removed. Currently, deposit rates for all maturity are free and the minimum maturity period for term deposits has been reduced to 7 days by 2004. Banks can offer differential rates of interest on wholesale domestic term deposits different from those offered on the retail domestic term deposits. Interest rate ceilings on export credit in foreign currency and non-resident deposits are prescribed but they are transparently linked to international interest rates. The Reserve Bank provides information on its website on the range of deposit rates and lending rates. We, thus, made a carefully calibrated transition from an administered interest rate regime to one of market determined interest rates over a period of time, while minimising disruption and preserving financial stability. This approach also provided market participants adequate time to adjust to the new regime. Interest rate deregulation is essential to smoothen the transmission channels of monetary policy and enhance the signaling effects of policy changes. However, some rigidities remain in certain segments hindering the overall efficiency of interest rates in resource allocation. In this context, administered interest rates fixed by the Government on a number of small saving schemes and provident funds is of special relevance as they generally offer a rate higher than corresponding instruments available in the market as well as tax incentives. As banks have to compete for funds with small saving schemes, the rates offered on long-term deposits mobilized by banks set the floor for lending rates at a level higher than would have obtained under competitive market conditions. In fact, this has been observed to be a factor contributing to downward stickiness of lending rates, which has some implications for the effectiveness of monetary policy. This is a reality that we have to appreciate and live with given the absence of social security coverage and adequate safety nets in the country. These small savings schemes administered by the government through the wide reach of post offices, and some through commercial banks, provide small savers access tax savings instruments that are seen as safe and stable. Whereas they do have some impact in terms of blunting monetary transmission mechanisms, they can perhaps be seen as contributing to overall financial stability. Benchmarking these administered interest rates to market determined rates has been proposed from time to time. Whereas some rationalisation in schemes has indeed been done, more progress will depend on the emergence of better social security and pension systems, and perhaps easier access to marketable sovereign instruments.  BIS Review 56/2006 2 
Finally, all sector-specific refinance facilities have been phased out except export credit refinance. A liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) consisting of repo / reverse repo in government securities has emerged since June 2000 as the main operating instrument of monetary policy. The LAF serves two objectives. First, it has provided greater flexibility in addressing day-to-day liquidity mismatches. Second, it sets a corridor for overnight market interest rates, imparting stability in the market. The LAF rates serve as tools for liquidity management as well as signalling of interest rates. The effectiveness of LAF has has perceptibly improved the efficacy of monetary policy transmission.  The evolution of autonomous monetary policy in the 1990s also depended on the effective removal of fiscal dominance that had existed earlier through the automatic monetisation of fiscal deficits. Over the period 1994-97, this subvention was phased out by agreement between the government and the RBI, marking a unique milestone in monetary–fiscal coordination. Another important institutional change was the freeing of the RBI’s balance sheet from the burden of exchange guarantees accumulated in the pre-reform era.  Legislative amendments have been carried out, first in 2000 and now in 2006, to strengthen RBI's regulatory jurisdiction over financial markets in terms of the operations of the forex, money and government securities markets. These legislative changes are expected to empower the RBI in terms of instrument independence and hence the effectiveness of monetary policy. In terms of process, we are also proceeding towards greater transparency and consultation, while increasing the frequency of policy reviews from semi-annual to quarterly. Alongside this enhancement in accountability we are also attempting greater transparency in communicating monetary policy. Going forward, the key issue, given the institutional empowerment, is the speed and quality of the transmission of monetary policy impulses. This is the subject matter of the following section. II. Monetary transmission  Consistent with these structural changes in the monetary policy framework, improvements in the channels of transmission emerged early on as a concurrent objective in order to enhance policy effectiveness. Accordingly, the RBI simultaneously undertook the development of the domestic financial market spectrum, sequenced into the process of deregulation of interest rates, the withdrawal of statutory pre-emptions, the qualitative improvement in monetary-fiscal coordination and the progressive liberalisation of the exchange and payments regime, including the institution of a market oriented exchange rate policy. The development of financial markets in India encompassed the introduction of new market segments, new instruments and a sharper focus on regulatory oversight.  The Indian money market was fairly underdeveloped till the mid-1980s; dominated by the overnight segment with a narrow base, limited number of participants and administered interest rates since December 1973. In 1987, participation was widened on the lending side and institutions were set up as market makers for the orderly development of the market. Select institutions were allowed to borrow from the money market on a term basis and the ceiling on interest rates was withdrawn in 1989. New instruments like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and Commercial Paper (CP) were introduced in 1989 and 1990 and interest rates on money market instruments became progressively market determined. In 1998, the RBI initiated a process of developing the overnight money market into a pure interbank market. The phasing out of non-banks from the money market was sequenced over the period 2000-05. Non-banks (except PDs who are allowed to operate in the overnight market) have largely migrated to the new collateralised markets which were developed in consonance. Non-banks can now take recourse to collateralised repos outside the RBI for purposes of borrowing and lending of funds. An innovative money market instrument called the Collateralised Borrowing and Lending Obligation (CBLO) was introduced in January 2003, which provides investors the benefit of guaranteed settlement and an exit option before maturity. Trading volumes in the collateralised money markets have increased substantially. Technological upgradation has accompanied the development of the money market. Efforts are currently underway to introduce screen-based negotiated quote-driven dealings in call/notice and term money markets. Information on overnight rates and volumes would be disseminated by the RBI in order to enable market participants to assess the liquidity conditions in an efficient and transparent manner. The Indian foreign exchange market has been widened and deepened with the transition to a market-determined exchange rate system in March 1993 and the subsequent liberalisation of restrictions on various external transactions leading up to current account convertibility under Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund in 1994. Since the mid-1990s, banks and other authorised entities have been accorded significant freedom to operate in the market. Banks have BIS Review 56/2006  3
been allowed freedom to fix their trading limits and to borrow and invest funds in the overseas markets up to specified limits. They have been allowed to use derivative products for hedging risks and asset-liability management purposes. Similarly, corporates have been given flexibility to book forward cover based on past turnover and are allowed to use a variety of instruments like interest rates and currency swaps, caps/collars and forward rate agreements. The swap market for hedging longer-term exposure has developed substantially in recent years. A number of steps have also been taken to liberalise the capital account covering foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, outward investment including direct investment as well as depository receipt and convertible bonds, opening of Indian corporate offices abroad and the like. In recent years, the Reserve Bank has delegated exchange control procedures to banks and authorised dealers to such an extent that there is hardly any need to approach the Reserve Bank for any approval. These reforms are being reflected in vibrancy in activity in various segments of the foreign exchange market with the daily turnover over US $33 billion (as at the end of April 2006).  The government securities market was moved to an auction-based system in 1992 to obtain better price discovery and to impart greater transparency in operations. This was a major institutional change which, along with the freeing of the money and foreign exchange market and the phasing out of automatic monetisation of fiscal deficits, created a conducive environment for the progressive deregulation that was to follow. The setting up of well capitalised Primary Dealers (PDs) for dealing in Government securities followed in 1995, backed up by the introduction of Delivery versus Payment (DvP) for Government securities, adoption of new techniques of floatation, introduction of new instruments, particularly Treasury Bills of varying maturities and repos on all Central Government dated securities and Treasury Bills of all maturities by April 1997.  It may be mentioned that since April 1992, the entire Central Government borrowing programme in dated securities has been conducted through auctions. In 2005 the Reserve Bank has put in place an anonymous order matching system to improve price discovery, and settlement procedures for mitigating risks. To further activate trading and improve the depth of the securities market, the introduction of a "when issued" market has also been announced recently. All these measures have brought about significant changes and a new treasury culture is developing, contributing to the formation of the term structure of interest rates. The demand for government securities is now driven more by considerations of effective management of liquidity rather than by statutory liquidity requirements. Efforts are being made to improve the retail holding of government securities since the Government securities market still lacks in depth and is dominated by banks and financial institutions often exhibiting uni-directional perceptions about liquidity. To attract retail participation in government securities market, one of the foremost tasks ahead is to create an environment that provides a safe and secure investment avenue for small investors with adequate returns and liquidity. In this context, the RBI is emphasising the provision of demat holding facility for non-institutional retail/small investors for risk mitigation in scrip losses or settlement of deals in the secondary market. Non-competitive bidding has also been introduced since January 2002 for direct access to the primary issues for non-sophisticated investors.  The corporate debt market in India has been in existence since independence in 1947. It was only since the mid - 1980s, however, that state owned public enterprises (PSUs) began issuing bonds. In the absence of a well functioning secondary market, such debt instruments have remained highly illiquid and unpopular among the investing population at large. Corporates continue to prefer private placements to public issues for raising resources. The dominance of private placement can be attributed to several factors, viz., ease of procedures and operation of private placement, considerably higher costs of public issues, and higher subscriptions for private placements. Financial institutions have tended to dominate public issues in the primary corporate debt market. The secondary market for corporate debt has suffered from lack of market making resulting in poor liquidity, and a tendency on the part of institutional investors to hold securities to maturity and consequent reduction in market supply of securities. Several measures have been taken in the recent past to transform the corporate debt market in India. Some of these measures include de-materialisation and electronic transfer of securities, rolling settlement, introduction of sophisticated risk management, trading and settlement systems. Towards the end of 2003, steps were also taken to reform the private placement market. All these measures are expected to improve the functioning of the corporate debt market in India. It needs to be recognised, however, that it has been difficult to develop the corporate bond market everywhere. Just under half the world’s corporate bond market is in the US, and another 15 per cent in Japan. Among other countries, the UK has a long standing bond market, but the European one is still developing.  BIS Review 56/2006 4 
Among developing countries, it is perhaps only South Korea that has a reasonably well developed bond market. The corporate debt market in India has a large potential to raise resources particularly for infrastructure projects, housing and for corporate and municipal needs. Appropriate institutional processes, development of various market segments including for mortgage – backed securities and bond insurance institutions for credit enhancement, easing cost and abridgment of disclosure requirements for listed companies, rating requirements for unlisted companies, a suitable framework for market making, consolidation, centralized data base on primary issues for wider public information, real time trade reporting system for dissemination of information, access to RTGS and state of the art technology would provide a strong impetus for corporate bond markets to grow in India.  A key area of emphasis in the development of financial markets in India is the provision of the appropriate technological infrastructure for trading, clearing, payment and settlement. Since the late 1990s, the establishment of a modern, robust payments and settlement system consistent with international best practices has emerged as an important objective of the RBI. A three-pronged strategy of consolidation, development and integration is pursued in this regard. Consolidation revolves around strengthening the existing payment system by providing the latest levels of technology. The developmental dimension includes real time gross settlement, centralised funds management, securities settlement and structured financial messaging. Other key elements in the technological content of market development are electronic clearing (introduced in 1994), electronic finds transfer (1996), quick funds transfers with centralized settlement in Mumbai (2003), negotiated dealing system (NDS), screen based order matching system (2002) for electronic reporting of trades and online dissemination system and submission of bids for primary issuance of government securities and a Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL), promoted by banks, financial institutions and primary dealers for clearing and settlement of trades in foreign exchange, government securities and other debt instruments, commenced operations in April 2001. The CCIL acts as a central counterparty (CCP) to all transactions and guarantees settlement of trades executed through its rules and regulations eliminating counterparty risks in adherence to international best practices. Oversight over the payments and settlement system is vested in a National Payments Council, and Board for Payment and Settlement Systems established within the RBI. As may be seen from this brief description of the various measures that had to be taken to develop the market and institutional framework for efficient monetary policy transmission, development of markets is an arduous and time consuming activity that requires conscious policy making and implementation. Markets do not develop and function overnight: they have to be created, nurtured and monitored on a continuous basis before they start functioning autonomously.  III. Exchange rate management The regime shift in the conduct of exchange rate management in India that occurred in the early 1990s had a significant impact on the monetary policy framework. Coincidentally, the 1990s were characterised by bouts of currency turmoil and contagious financial crises in many parts of the world, developing, transitional and developed alike. Monetary policy became increasingly complex. For the majority of developing countries, including those in the Asian region, which continue to depend on export performance, appropriate exchange rate determination is of great importance as volatility imposes significant real effects in terms of fluctuations in employment and output and the distribution of activity between tradeables and non-tradeables, fluctuations that are difficult to absorb in such economies. In the fiercely competitive trading environment where countries seek to expand market shares aggressively by fiercely compressing margins, volatility in the exchange rate can easily translate ex ante profits into ex post losses along with the deleterious collateral impact on employment and economic welfare. The determinants of exchange rate behaviour however, seem to have altered dramatically. Earlier, factors related to changes in merchandise trade flows and the behaviour of commodity price inflation were well understood and provided guidance for operating monetary policy. In this environment, monetary policy principally targeting low inflation was consistent with exchange rate changes under purchasing power parity. These traditional anchors of understanding have been swept away by the vicissitudes of capital movements, with currencies often moving far out of alignment of the traditional fundamentals. Moreover, it now appears that expectations and even momentary reactions to the day’s news are often more important in determining fluctuations in capital flows and hence it serves to amplify exchange rates volatility.  Furthermore, the liquidity impact of capital flows has become an even more important problem for monetary management than it was the case hitherto. The globalisation of financial markets, even if BIS Review 56/2006  5
imperfect, has now magnified the impact of monetary policy actions taken in one country on others. The policy accommodation pursued until recently by the US had a global impact, affecting the rest of the world with an abundance of liquidity. Low interest rates in the US have encouraged capital to flow into emerging market economies. This has resulted in a large build-up of foreign exchange reserves and excessive domestic liquidity in many countries in Asia, amplifying the Fed’s policy stance. Complicating the environment of monetary and exchange rate management further, there is now increasing evidence that exchange rate pass-through to domestic inflation has tended to decline from the 1990s across a number of countries. Inflation has turned out to be much less sensitive to exchange rates but has tended to equilibrate around the globe (Mohan, 2005). In India, the exchange rate regime up to 1990 is best described as an adjustable nominal peg to a basket of currencies of major trading partners with a band. After the balance of payment crisis of 1991 a two-step downward adjustment in the exchange rate was undertaken in July 1991 and then followed by a transitional 11-month period of dual exchange rates before a market-determined exchange rate system was set in place in March, 1993. Since then, the exchange rate is largely determined by demand and supply conditions in the market. The exchange rate policy in recent years has been guided by the broad principles of careful monitoring and management of exchange rates with flexibility, without a fixed target or a pre-announced target or a band, while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way. Subject to this predominant objective, the exchange rate policy is guided by the need to reduce excess volatility, prevent the emergence of destabilising speculative activities, help maintain adequate level of reserves, and develop an orderly foreign exchange market. The Indian market, like other developing countries markets, is not yet very deep and broad, and can sometimes be characterised by uneven flow of demand and supply over different periods. In this situation, the Reserve Bank of India has been prepared to make sales and purchases of foreign currency in order to even out lumpy demand and supply in the relatively thin forex market and to smoothen jerky movements. However, such intervention is not governed by a predetermined target or band around the exchange rate. As the foreign exchange exposure of the Indian economy expands, the role of such uneven demands can be seen to reduce. While it is not possible for any country to remain completely unaffected by developments in the international exchange markets, fortunately we were able to keep the spillover effects of the Asian crisis to a minimum through constant monitoring and timely action, including recourse to strong monetary measures, when necessary, to prevent the emergence of self-fulfilling speculative activities (Mohan, 2005). The experience with capital flows has important lessons for the choice of the exchange rate regime. The advocacy for corner solutions – a fixed peg without monetary policy independence or a freely floating exchange rate retaining discretionary conduct of monetary policy – is distinctly on the decline. The weight of experience seems to be tilting in favour of intermediate regimes with country-specific features, without targets for the level of the exchange rate and exchange market interventions to fight extreme market turbulence. In general, emerging market economies have accumulated massive foreign exchange reserves as a circuit breaker for situations where unidirectional expectations become self-fulfilling.  Recent information suggests that India’s integration with the world economy is getting stronger, with implications for the conduct of exchange rate policies in the future. Trade in goods (i.e., exports plus imports) as a proportion of GDP increased from 14.6 per cent in 1990-91 to 28.9 per cent in 2004-05; while gross current account receipts and payments as percentage of GDP increased from 19.4 per cent to 45.0 per cent over the same period, reflecting the growth in buoyant Indian trade in services. Correspondingly, in the capital account, gross flows (total inflows plus outflows) have doubled as a proportion of GDP: from 12 per cent in 1990-91 to 24 per cent (US$ 167 billion) in 2004-05. Thus, the Indian economy is substantially exposed to the international economy and hence increasingly subject to the vicissitudes of international financial developments. There is also growing evidence pointing to a distinct strengthening of India’s balance of payments, benefiting from the equilibrating properties of a more flexible exchange rate regime. Recent developments in the balance of payments seem to indicate that the Indian economy is entering an expansionary phase of the business cycle. A noteworthy feature is the re-emergence of a current account deficit (CAD) since 2004-05 after a hiatus of three years of surpluses, preceded by a decade of CADs averaging 1 per cent of GDP. Oil imports, which account for about a quarter of total imports, have recorded high growth rates and contributed 47 per cent to the change in the current account deficit in 2004-05 over the previous year. The elevated levels of international crude prices that rule currently have affected countries across the globe and India has been no exception. Apart from the impact of high crude oil price, the significant growth in merchandise trade deficit in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was also caused by the sizeable growth in non-oil  BIS Review 56/2006 6 
goods imports, emanating from capital goods, export-related inputs and a range of intermediate goods all of which have an intrinsic growth linked character. Besides, the large expansion in imports is also spurring vigorous export growth. In this sense, the merchandise trade deficit has acquired a growth leading dimension and is thus a positive feature of the Indian economy.  As the current account deficit widens, and we contribute to the unwinding of global imbalances at the margin, we have to give consideration to the sustainable magnitude of the current account deficit. This sustainability depends on the perceived stability of capital flows which, in turn, would be dependent on the assessment of growth prospects of the economy by foreign lenders and investors. Whereas it is understood that a more open economy that has access to international capital flows can run a higher current account deficit than a less open one, our approach to this issue will remain informed by appropriate caution in the interest of financial stability. The acceleration in overall growth and the re-emergence of current account deficit since 2004-05 has been accompanied by a greater degree of openness. The growth in current payments has been accompanied by healthy growth in current receipts - in both goods and services, thus providing for some confidence in the sustainability of current trade patterns and financial stability. Current receipts pay for up to about 90 per cent of current payments. Within current receipts, merchandise exports are being rapidly exceeded in terms of growth rates by software earnings and a wide variety of business services. Besides, private transfer receipts, comprising mainly remittances from Indians working abroad, seemed to have acquired a permanent character and have risen steadily to constitute around 3 per cent of GDP in recent years, impervious to exchange rate movements. It needs to be mentioned that oil price increases typically result in higher remittances to India as well as non-resident deposit inflows in the capital account, producing non-linearity in the impact of international crude prices on the Indian economy. These factors strengthen the capability of the Indian economy to sustain higher CADs than in the past. Net capital flows have regularly exceeded the CAD requirements by a fair measure, enabling large accretions to the reserves. In fact, the expansion in the CAD during 2005-06 has masked the strength of the capital flows. With such an increase in exposure to the international economy, trade and other current account flows, along with capital flows, the Indian economy is entering uncharted territory, although a healthy one from all accounts. We have found that our approach of broad market determination of the exchange rate, flexibility, combined with intervention as felt necessary, has served as well so far. As we proceed we feel confident that we continue in a similar direction in the future, while constantly monitoring the situation to make any changes that may become desirable. IV. Dealing with change Recent developments have posed testing challenges to the conduct of monetary and exchange rate management in India as in the rest of the world. While world GDP growth is well above its long-run average of 3.8 per cent, there is a growing incidence of large systemic shocks. Though price stability has been maintained in the face of the oil shock, risks loom large in the form of lagged second order effects of oil price increases, geopolitical tensions, the probability of disorderly and rapid adjustment of current account imbalances and the risks emanating from the housing market, particularly when the cycle turns down. The outlook for the oil economy in the near term appears to be tilting in favour of higher prices and greater volatility. Global imbalances widened further during 2005 in an environment of rising interest rates worldwide and ample liquidity in global financial markets. The current account deficit of the US surpassed US $800 billion, matched by increased surpluses elsewhere, particularly in Europe, East Asia and oil-exporting countries. While the deficit is still increasing, the location of the surplus appears to be changing recently. The current account surpluses of the oil-exporting countries of the Middle East are close to those of emerging Asia. Less than a third of the combined current account surplus of the oil-exporting countries has been reflected in their foreign exchange reserves, which rose, by about US $90 billion in 2005. There are some indications that the oil surpluses have been deployed in more diversified avenues through new investment agencies and oil stabilisation funds which could be invested in assets other than bank deposits. In an environment of above trend growth in the world economy, unusually low volatility in financial markets and strong profitability in banking systems in most countries, investors have been prepared to purchase risky assets at relatively high prices in 2005. Monitoring where the risk lies has become very difficult for the regulators, due to emergence of large conglomerates, sophisticated market instruments such as derivatives and presence of players like hedge funds. In this environment, any volatile and BIS Review 56/2006  7
unpredictable changes in asset prices could become a source of financial instability. To maintain confidence in the financial system, it is necessary to prevent shocks from spreading through contagion.  Private capital inflows to emerging market economies increased in 2005; market access continued to be favourable and external financing costs dropped sharply. There have been low levels of credit spreads on bonds issued by emerging markets and companies with low credit ratings, which are around their lowest levels since 1997. Partly in response to these very positive borrowing conditions, an increasing number of emerging market countries have been able to issue long-term debt in their own currency and thereby reduce foreign currency exposure and rollover risk. Of the major central banks, the US Federal Reserve has raised its policy rate by 25 basis points each on sixteen occasions from 1.0 per cent in June 2004 to 5.0 per cent by May 2006. The ECB and Bank of England are hinting at policy rate increases in the coming months.  Under these conditions, certain stylised aspects of exchange market behaviour need to be kept in mind while dealing with monetary and exchange rate management from a medium term perspective. First, the day-to-day exchange rate movements in the short-run in foreign exchange markets have little to do with the so-called ‘fundamentals’ or a country’s capacity to meet its payments obligations, including debt service. Second, in view of inter-bank activity, which sets the pace in forex markets, transaction volumes in “gross” terms are several times higher, and more variable, than “net” flows. Third, developing countries generally have smaller and localised forex markets where nominal domestic currency values were generally expected to show a depreciating trend, particularly if relative inflation rates were higher than those of major industrial countries. In this situation, there is a greater tendency among market participants to hold long positions in foreign currencies and to hold back sales when expectations are adverse and currencies are depreciating, than the other way round when currencies are appreciating and expectations are favourable. In recent years, exchange rate trends have been more mixed despite the existence of inflation differentials. Consequently, we are also seeing change in such behavioural trends. Fourth, the tendency of importers/exporters and other end-users to look at exchange rate movements as a source of return without adopting appropriate risk management strategies, at times, creates uneven supply-demand conditions, often based on “news and views”. A self-sustaining triangle of supply demand mismatch, increased inter-bank activity to take advantage of it and accentuated volatility triggered by negative sentiments, not in tune with fundamentals can be set in motion, requiring quick intervention/response by authorities.  Against this back ground, India’s exchange rate policy of focusing on managing volatility with no fixed rate target while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine the exchange rate movements over a period in an orderly way has stood the test of time. Despite several unexpected external and domestic developments, India’s external situation continues to remain satisfactory. Our experience has also highlighted the importance of building up foreign exchange reserves to take care of unforeseen contingencies, volatile capital flows and other developments, which can affect expectations adversely as the emerging economies have to rely largely on their own resources during external exigencies (or contagion) as there is no international “lender of last resort” to provide additional liquidity at short notice on acceptable terms. Thus, the need for adequate reserves is unlikely to be eliminated or reduced even if exchange rates are allowed to float freely.  The overall approach to the management of India’s foreign exchange reserves in recent years has reflected the changing composition of balance of payments, and has endeavoured to reflect the “liquidity risks” associated with different types of flows and other requirements. The policy for reserve management is thus judiciously built upon a host of identifiable factors and other contingencies. Such factors, inter alia, include: the size of the current account deficit; the size of short-term liabilities (including current repayment obligations on long-term loans); the possible variability in portfolio investments and other types of capital flows; the unanticipated pressures on the balance of payments arising out of external shocks and movements in the repatriable foreign currency deposits of non-resident Indians. Taking these factors into account, India’s foreign exchange reserves are at present comfortable, although pursuing this policy on a long-term basis raised the issue of sustainability of such strategy especially under the backdrop of uninterrupted inflows of foreign capital, optimum sterilization of such flows, appropriate instrument and cost of pursuing sterilization and associated liquidity management. In fact, the conduct of monetary policy and management in the context of large and volatile capital flows has proved to be difficult for many countries.  A key issue facing India admidst these sweeping winds of change is to work out the policy mix of instruments for liquidity management consistent with the monetary policy framework and operating procedures. In this context, the Indian experience with sterilisation and liquidity management is  BIS Review 56/2006 8 
somewhat unique as compared with the approach followed by some other central banks in Asia. For instance, central banks in Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand all sterilised inflows in different ways. The Bank Indonesia (BI) employed Open Market Operations (OMOs) by issuing its own paper and also managed its budgetary operations in a way that built up large deposits with the bank Indonesia. While the Bank of Thailand (BOT) conducted OMOs to sterilize inflows, central bank bills were used extensively by the Bank of Korea (BoK) which later used quantitative controls and discounting policies to dampen domestic credit. Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) historically deployed government and other deposits with the central bank to impact monetary liquidity. On the other hand, China sterilised capital inflows through issuance of central bank bills apart from using other instruments like reserve requirements, differentiating prudential treatment of banks based on capital strength, etc. In the Indian context, sharp shifts in capital flows and hence in liquidity have marked the period during 2001-06 and can be explained as partly frictional and arising from seasonal and transient factors and partly cyclical, associated with the pick up in growth momentum and the induced demand for bank credit. This has warranted appropriate monetary operations to obviate wide fluctuations in market rates and ensure reasonable stability consistent with the monetary policy stance. In fact, the Indian experience illustrates the tight link between external sector management and domestic monetary management. What may be small movements in capital flows for the rest of the world can translate into large domestic liquidity movements distorting market exchange and interest rates in a developing country. Moreover, the absorption of external savings is also dependent on the stage of a business cycle that a country may be going through. In our case, the early years of this decade were characterised by low industrial growth and hence the absorptive capacity of the country was constrained. As we have entered an expansionary phase the current account has widened and the potential for greater absorption has manifested itself. Just as foreign exchange reserves can act as a shock absorber, on the external front, we had to look for a parallel liquidity shock absorber for domestic monetary management.  In this  context, a new instrument, named as the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) has evolved as a useful instrument of monetary policy to sustain open market operations. The MSS was made operational from April 2004. Under this scheme, which is meant exclusively for liquidity management, the Reserve Bank has been empowered to issue Government Treasury Bills and medium duration dated securities for the purpose of liquidity absorption. The scheme works by impounding the proceeds of auctions of Treasury bill and Government securities in a separate identifiable MSS cash account maintained and operated by the RBI. The amounts credited into the MSS cash Account are appropriated only for the purpose of redemption and / or buy back of the Treasury Bills and / or dated securities issued under the MSS. MSS securities are indistinguishable from normal Treasury Bills and Government dated securities in the hands of the lender. The payments for interest and discount on MSS securities are not made from the MSS Account, but shown in the Union budget and other related documents transparently as distinct components under separate sub-heads. The introduction of MSS has succeeded, in principle, in restoring LAF to its intended function of daily liquidity management. Since its introduction in April 2004, the MSS has served as a very useful instrument for medium term monetary and liquidity management. It has been unwound in times of low capital flows and greater liquidity needs and built up when excess capital flows could lead to excess domestic liquidity. Going forward, there will be a continuous need to adapt the strategy of liquidity management as well as exchange rate management for effective monetary management and short-term interest rate smoothening. This issue becomes even more relevant under a freer regime of capital flows. Global developments are expected to have an increasing role in determining the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies in our countries. In an environment of global convergence, retaining independence of monetary policy may become increasingly difficult, calling for hard choices in terms of goals and instruments.  V. Financial integration in Asia - some issues In an era of increasing globalisation, discussion on monetary policy and exchange rate frameworks cannot be done in isolation. It is, therefore, pertinent to place the Indian experience in the context of Asian economic co-operation. Recent years have witnessed an expansion of the channels of integration within the Asian region, built primarily on strong macroeconomic performance. Asia accounts for more than 30 per cent of world GDP and contributes half of global growth. While the Asian Development Bank placed the aggregate GDP growth for the region at 7.3 per cent in 2004, the BIS Review 56/2006  9
IMF in its World Economic Outlook, projected growth for emerging Asian economies at 7.3 per cent for the year 2005 too. Inflationary pressures were experienced in some of the Asian countries during 2004 and 2005, but were moderate in the context of high growth and oil prices. GDP growth in emerging Asia is driven by robust export growth as well as strong domestic demand. Sustained rapid growth in recent years and rising living standards have been accompanied by a dramatic increase in Asia's shares in world exports and raw material consumption. Clearly, globalization has had a major impact on Asia’s role in the world economy as there is an ongoing transformation in the composition of production and trade with rising comparative advantage globally. In particular, economies with relatively high wage costs are shifting toward higher value-added products, including services, within the region. Furthermore, financial flows within the region have become more significant, intermediating savings within Asia, as well as channelling them to other parts of the world. The emerging markets of Asia, with their dynamic and skilled work force, are well placed to take advantage of new technologies and seize opportunities in the international market place to become a major engine of growth in the global economy. Strong economic performance has been accompanied by an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves to build up resilience against external shocks (Reserve Bank of India, 2006).  As the Asian region has developed, intra Asian trade has gathered momentum leading to even higher economic integration within the region. This has been aided by the existence of ASEAN, which has progressively led to lowering of trade barriers among its member countries. As the ASEAN region has developed and gained in confidence trade links with the more developed countries of Japan, China and Korea have also intensified, along with more structured discussions towards the formation of PTAs and FTAs within the region. While this trade integration has intensified over time progress on financial integration has been limited. Understandably, there is now increasing discussion on the nature and prospects of progressive financial integration commensurate with degree of economic integration observed in the region. Although financial integration in Asia is possibly lagging trade integration, the initiatives taken on this front are getting stronger. Central bank cooperation in Asia through a network of swaps was formalised in Chiang Mai Agreement of 2000 among central banks in East Asia. Among others, this led to two parallel movements – one in South Asia in the form of the SAARC Initiative and the other in East Asia reflecting the ASEAN+3 Initiative. The idea of having an integrated financial system so as to provide viable ‘safety net’ in times of crisis germinated quite strongly. More recently, there has been some discussion on the adoption of an Asian Currency Unit to avoid the volatility in intra-Asian currency movements and to create one of the principal currencies of the world. In this context, it is important to revisit first principles.  India's engagement with South East and East Asia is also on the upswing. The share of exports to developing Asia in India’s total exports more than doubled from about 14 per cent in 1990-91 to almost 30 per cent in 2005-06. The corresponding share of the region in India’s imports also increased from 14 per cent to 21 per cent during this period. In recent years, China has emerged as a major trading partner for India, accounting for 6.0 per cent of total exports and 7.4 per cent of total imports in 2005-06. In recognition of this expansion of economic engagement with the rest of Asia, as Governor Y.V. Reddy had announced at the First IMF-MAS Seminar held here last year, we have already implemented computation of the new six country real effective exchange rate (REER) index. This new index introduces two new currencies, the Remnimbi and the Hong Kong Dollar to supplement the earlier currency basket that includes the US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro, and the Japanese Yen (Reddy, 2005). In the post-Asian crisis period, several Asian economies have adopted different types of intermediate exchange rate regimes with a growing preference for relatively more flexible exchange rates than before. In this respect, the key issue is how much of such flexibility is envisaged as optimal? What are the instruments to manage exchange rates? It is also necessary in this regard to recognize and re-assess the optimal level of ‘insurance’ that is provided by the foreign exchange reserves that is needed against potentially volatile and disruptive capital flows. Finally, recent sharp upward movements in oil prices in an era of heightened uncertainty may evoke differential responses on account of country-specific factors. It is in this milieu that the pragmatic choice of instrument of integration in the region has been regional trade agreements, best viewed as an expression of enlightened self-interest. The move towards regionalism has been catalyzed by the growing consensus that the enhancement of public good requires coordinated action and belief in overlapping fortunes. India has also entered into various regional economic cooperation, free/preferential trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties with its Asian neighbours.   BIS Review 56/2006 10 
Drawing from the experience and lessons of other regional blocks, it is important to take cognizance of certain issues for successful functioning of cooperative monetary arrangements as envisaged under any common currency unit. While a single currency has worked well in the context of the trading bloc centered on the USA, lessons can also be drawn from the recent experience of monetary and economic integration in Europe. The history of European monetary integration dated back with the creation of trading bloc - European Economic Community (EEC) - in 1958, which took the shape of the European Monetary System (EMS) in 1979 with a fluctuating exchange rate band among member countries. Currently, there are 12 countries that comprise a common Euro area (monetary union), although 25 countries constitute the member states of the European Union (EU). Some of the EU member countries are actively trying to be the part of the Euro area by fulfilling the four broad convergence criteria stipulated. The objective of monetary union in the euro area was clearly defined in the Maastricht Treaty and the primary objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) is to maintain price stability in the euro area. Price stability was then defined by the European Central Bank as an inflation rate of below but close to 2 per cent over the medium-term. The integration was largely facilitated by an institutional framework that had evolved over more than forty years.  It may be useful to note that in the United States, which may itself be seen as a large currency area, a single currency works because of the existence of labour mobility across regions and wage and price flexibility, within and across regions, i.e., due to real factors which determine the real effective exchange rate (REER) and long-run competitiveness. On the other hand, in Europe, introduction of a single currency met with some resistance due to language and cultural differences that historically limit labour mobility and wage flexibility. Labor unions are more powerful in Europe than in the United States, making real wages sticky. Moreover, with product market competition less intense, European producers are more likely to pass wage costs to consumers in the form of higher prices. Reflecting these factors, unemployment in the European countries appears to be more persistent in nature than in the US. Suffice it to conclude that the jury is still out on the merits of a common currency as it does reduce the flexibility of an economy to adjust to real sector changes (as is being seen in Europe). This in turn, can cause differential effective overvaluation/undervaluation of the currency across different countries within a currency union and possible erosion of long-term competitiveness of affected countries. Relative to the Euro area, the Asian region exhibits much more pronounced diversity in economic structure, stages of development, demographic features, social and political systems and even lower mobility of factors of production, particularly labour. The successful operation of any currency area is dependent on wage flexibility and labour mobility across regions. With the existence of a common external exchange rate, effective internal flexibility in the "exchange rate" for a particular region can be achieved by the lower or higher wages, as necessary, relative to the rest of the currency area. Equilibration is then achieved through labour mobility that responds to these inter-regional wage differences. Furthermore, as has been found in Europe, through the imposition of the Maastricht criteria, commonality in fiscal conditions across countries is desirable for effective area-wide monetary policy. Any movement towards greater monetary and exchange rate cooperation among Asian countries will need to pay explicit attention to this set of difficult issues. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that greater financial cooperation that leads to greater trade facilitation and fosters greater capital market linkages among Asian countries would be a move in the right direction. As there is greater variation among Asian countries with regard to the existence of current account surpluses and deficits, greater capital market linkage through the development of bond markets, trading and settlement systems and the like, will enable surplus countries to invest in the deficit countries within the region. Thus Asian savings would have the potential of being put to use for fostering growth within the region. VI.  Conclusion Cooperation among central banks around Asia is likely to play a key role in nurturing a broad – based mandate for integration. This has been in evidence as it helps in exchanging views and information on various subjects of common interests. Central bank cooperation helped in resolving the Mexican crisis of 1994. The most recent and ultimate form of central bank cooperation was achieved in 1998 when the European Central Bank (ECB) was created as the sole authority over monetary policy among its 11 members and with the creation of a new common currency in January 1999. On the other hand, according to some experts, central bank cooperation leads to moral hazard and, therefore, tampering BIS Review 56/2006  11
with otherwise efficient market determined exchange rates, trade flows and general function of the market forces.  Nevertheless, in the context of our region, central bank cooperation is indispensable. In fact, with improvements in transportation and communication, some commonality in world view on the operations of the economy, and enhanced institutional arrangements, central bank cooperation has grown extensively. The increased degree of global integration and liberalization of capital movements would serve to be a dominant factor in encouraging cooperation amongst central banks in our region. Furthermore, a major implication of growing financial and trade integration, globally as well as within the region, is the greater susceptibility of monetary policy and exchange rate management to global factors relative to domestic factors, necessitating increased co-ordination in macro-economic management. The perceived benefits and costs of economic integration of a country within a larger region have to be seen in the context of the economy's resilience to possible shocks in an open economy framework. The ability of a country to derive benefits from economic cooperation in the presence of volatility in international capital flows is ultimately contingent upon the quality of its macroeconomic framework and institutions.

Mark W Olson: What are examiners looking for when they examine banks for compliance?  Remarks by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the American Bankers Association's Regulatory Compliance Conference, Orlando, 12 June 2006. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to speak today on an issue of great interest to many of us, that is, compliance-risk management and supervisory expectations. Over the last few years, legal and regulatory compliance breakdowns have attracted increased attention across the financial industry. Fortunately, most of you have responded to your evolving compliance risks by investing in effective compliance-risk management programs. However, now and then, headline-grabbing incidents of noncompliance continue to capture public attention, especially when they involve such sensitive areas as fair lending and the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). Conferences such as this are valuable opportunities for you, as compliance experts, to share experiences and successful approaches to controlling compliance risk. To assist you in your efforts to fine-tune your compliance-risk management programs, I'd like to give you a sense of what Federal Reserve examiners look for when they conduct examinations. I will also take a few minutes to address our more focused work in two particularly important areas of regulatory compliance: compliance with BSA requirements and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data reporting requirements. Otherwise, I will not focus on examinations that look solely at the level of compliance with specific laws and regulations but will focus on how examiners assess the adequacy of a compliance-risk management program and its ability to manage the organization's compliance risk. Compliance-risk management Overall, a banking organization's compliance-risk management program should enable it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the compliance risks involved in its various products and lines of business. These are fundamental principles not only for compliance-risk management, but also for sound management of credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk.  It's worth taking a moment to define compliance risk. It is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation and franchise value that may arise when an organization fails to comply with laws, regulations, or standards or codes of conduct of self-regulatory organizations applicable to the business activities and functions of the banking organization.  While all banking organizations should have a program in place to effectively manage compliance risk, these programs can vary considerably, depending on the size, complexity, and geographic reach of the banking organization and the inherent risks of its activities. As with other types of risk, large multinational organizations will require more elaborate and formal compliance-risk management systems to address their broader and typically more complex range of financial activities and to provide senior managers and directors with the information they need to monitor and direct activities. Therefore, our supervisory expectations regarding an organization's risk-management program, and more specifically the scope of an examination, will vary according to the organization's size and complexity. Assessing the adequacy of compliance-risk management programs The Federal Reserve's supervisory approach in the area of compliance-risk management is consistent with our long-standing focus on the adequacy of banking organizations' overall management of risk. To this end, Federal Reserve examiners assess the quality of a banking organization's systems for identifying, measuring, and containing its risks. While historically there has been a greater emphasis on risk management in the areas of credit, market, operational, and liquidity risk, because of the growing complexity of banking operations and their regulatory frameworks the Federal Reserve is taking a greater interest in banking organizations' ability to manage their compliance risk. BIS Review 56/2006  1
Scoping the examination Generally, a Federal Reserve examination team begins by defining the scope of the examination; this is when examiners determine the areas of focus and level of scrutiny. The scope of the examination will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the banking organization. For example, as part of the scoping exercise, examiners will consider previous examination and audit findings to determine whether the organization has a satisfactory history of compliance or whether there have been previous concerns about its compliance-risk management program. The examination team will also review the organization's compliance-risk assessment. Depending on its quality, the risk assessment can also help direct the resources of the examination team. Altogether, the information gleaned from examination and audit findings and a current risk assessment will directly affect the scope of the examination, including the level and area of transaction testing required to assess the adequacy of the compliance-risk management program. At institutions with a less satisfactory record, a more extensive review will be necessary.  Federal Reserve examinations for compliance-risk management are not designed to be gotcha games in which examiners look for one-time breaches of specific regulations or laws. Rather, these examinations are designed to assess the adequacy of the structure and processes the institution uses for managing compliance risk. Examiners are expected to look for the bigger picture and to look at the effectiveness of the program (including policies and processes) for managing the organization's compliance risk. We want to understand whether you have the controls in place to manage the risk of your organization.  As with all areas of risk management, our expectations - and therefore the scope of many examinations in this area - are framed by an emphasis on; • board and senior management oversight,  • policies and procedures,  • internal controls,  • monitoring and reporting, and  • training.  I'll give you a sense of some of the key components that examiners are likely to look for when assessing these fundamental areas. Board and senior management oversight A successful compliance-risk management program starts at the top of the organization. It is essential that the board of directors takes the lead by requiring a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is incorporated into the organization's day-to-day operations and is well communicated by senior management so that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities and their roles in implementing the enterprise-wide program. Examiners will look to understand the board and senior management's roles in setting and communicating the compliance culture within the organization. Examiners will also look to see that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated throughout the organization and that senior management and staff understand their compliance obligations. In order for the board and senior management to carry out their responsibilities, they need to understand the organization's current compliance risks. We have seen organizations that have experienced challenges as a result of a lack of clarity in this area as they grow and diversify.  Examiners will determine whether the organization has an effective risk assessment that accurately identifies its compliance risks and whether material risks are communicated to the board. Effective risk assessment measures the risk presented by clients, products and services, and geographic exposure within specific business lines or activities and aggregates these risks across the organization. Risk assessment is critical not only to ensure that the board and senior management is well informed. It also serves as the foundation for risk-based policies, procedures, and internal controls. Examiners will look to understand the organization's risk-assessment process. For example, they will look to see the degree to which the business lines are involved, how frequently the risk assessment is updated, and how it incorporates new products, services, or legal entities.   BIS Review 56/2006 2 
Human and financial resources are, of course, critical to effective performance. Consequently, examiners will assess whether senior management ensures that the compliance program has sufficient financial resources and a sufficient number of qualified and well-trained staff to carry out its responsibilities effectively. Policies and procedures Policies and procedures essentially define and communicate the key goals and processes of an organization's compliance program. Examiners will look to see whether policies and procedures provide for adequate risk identification, assessment, measurement, and control.  As I mentioned a few moments ago, clearly communicated roles and responsibilities are a characteristic of an effective compliance program. Toward that end, examiners will also look to determine whether policies clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across the organization's activities. Examiners also expect to see a well-defined process for ensuring that when compliance risks or potential breaches are identified they are elevated to the appropriate level, in keeping with the risk to the organization. Procedures for doing so should be well-communicated to staff throughout the organization.  Overall, policies and procedures must be kept current, and, as with the risk assessment, examiners will look to see whether information gleaned from the compliance program operations is used to further tailor compliance policies, procedures, and controls to specifically address the inherent environment as it evolves.  Internal controls Internal controls are a particularly crucial element of a compliance-risk management program. Examiners will verify whether the organization has established and implemented an effective system of internal controls, including appropriate reporting lines and separation of duties, as well as positive and negative incentives.  An essential part of the internal control framework is periodic testing to determine how well the framework is operating, so that any required remedial actions can be taken. The frequency of testing should be risk-based and should involve, as appropriate, sample transaction testing, the sample size being determined by volume and the degree of risk of the activity.  Examiners will carefully assess the scope and quality of the testing of the compliance program. Part of this assessment will include determining whether the testing was performed with appropriate independence. Examiners will also look to understand the specific delineations of responsibilities between the internal audit, compliance, and other independent functions or third parties. These delineations will vary by organization, but all roles should be clearly defined and communicated.  Examiners will also look at how well compliance-testing exceptions are reported to senior management and resolved by business-line management. They will assess methods for tracking exceptions until the exceptions are resolved; this assessment will include examining the organization's provisions for escalating unresolved exceptions to higher levels in the organization, including the board of directors.  Independence and separation of duties are also issues of importance beyond compliance testing. For example, in the case of large complex banking organizations that may have a corporate compliance function, examiners will be interested in understanding how the compliance function maintains its independence from the business lines it advises on compliance requirements and the implementation of required controls. In cases in which the compliance function has responsibility for monitoring and testing, examiners will assess whether procedures are established to ensure an adequate degree of independence and objectivity.  Monitoring and reporting As I mentioned, the fundamental purpose of compliance-risk management programs is to identify, monitor, and manage compliance risk more effectively. Monitoring involves identifying and BIS Review 56/2006  3
communicating compliance concerns to the appropriate parties within the organization. Monitoring and reporting enable senior management and the board to effectively carry out their respective responsibilities. We have seen organizations silo critical compliance information rather than share it with all levels of the organization, which can handicap an organization's ability to identify systemic risks. As a result, examiners are interested in whether a compliance program is designed to monitor and report compliance concerns. The level of sophistication of banking organizations' monitoring activities generally varies according to the size and complexity of the organization, and examiners' expectations will vary accordingly. For example, large complex banking organizations are typically supported by information systems that provide management with timely reports related to compliance with laws and regulations at the transaction level. Examiners will look to see whether these reports generally address monitoring and testing activities, actual or potential material compliance deficiencies or breaches, and new or changing compliance requirements. They will also assess whether reports are designed to ensure that information on compliance is communicated to the appropriate levels within the organization.  Training Training on policies, procedures, and associated controls is a component of compliance-risk management that should not be overlooked. Examiners will determine whether the banking organization's training program ensures that compliance policies, procedures, and controls are well understood and appropriately communicated throughout the organization.  While the depth and breadth of training that an employee receives depends on that employee's role and responsibilities, examiners generally assess whether staff at all levels understand the organization's compliance culture, general compliance-risk issues, and high-level compliance policies and procedures.  Supervisory consistency and the Bank Secrecy Act As banking organizations become more complex, consistency in the agencies' supervisory approach has become even more critical. The Federal Reserve views supervisory consistency as a means of enhancing supervision and reducing burden. This is particularly essential in the area of regulatory compliance, and specifically with regard to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and its regulations. The Federal Reserve includes a review of BSA compliance within every full-scope safety-and-soundness examination. For larger banking organizations that are subject to continuous supervision, the Federal Reserve conducts a series of targeted BSA reviews over the course of the supervisory cycle. This, combined with off-site monitoring, allows the Federal Reserve to maintain a current understanding of BSA compliance within the organizations that are subject to its supervision. On-site examinations are essential to ensure that the BSA program is operating effectively.  Because of the complexity of banking organizations today, a number of institutions may be subject to the supervision of an increasing number of regulators. A consistent examination approach among regulators is critical in order to achieve a consolidated view of risk management within an organization, and also to reduce burden on banking organizations. Our work with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to develop the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering Examination Manual, which was released last summer, marked an important step forward in our effort to ensure consistent supervision in the area of BSA compliance. Through the manual, the agencies have emphasized a banking organization's responsibility to establish and implement risk-based policies, procedures, and processes to comply with the BSA and safeguard its operations from money laundering and terrorist financing.  The agencies are currently updating the manual and plan to release the revised version this summer. I have been told that the revised manual will include not only updates reflecting changes in regulations and supervisory guidance over the course of the past year, but also, among other things, additional guidance on developing a BSA/AML risk assessment, which is the foundation of effective risk-based controls.   BIS Review 56/2006 4 
HMDA data and fair lending examinations Examinations to evaluate a banking organization's adherence to fair lending laws and regulations are also a routine component of consumer compliance examinations conducted by the Federal Reserve. HMDA data play an important role in examinations of those banking organizations that are required to report the data. Examiners probe that data to understand how the bank is responding to credit needs and serving its community. The data are rich in many respects. They contain information about applicants' and borrowers' race or ethnicity, sex, income level, and property location. And, since 2004, the HMDA data have also included price information about certain loans with prices that exceed thresholds set by the Board.  The HMDA data help examiners better focus the fair lending examination. Particularly for banks with larger portfolios, the data, including any available pricing data, are incorporated into statistical management systems that analyze lending patterns and help direct the examination process to aspects of the bank's program that may warrant a closer look. Even in smaller banks where a statistical analysis cannot be performed, the HMDA data can be used to start the fair lending review. However, as we know, HMDA data have limitations. For example, the data do not include credit-risk factors such as credit scores and loan-to-value ratios. Because of these limitations, the examination process looks at additional information about a lender's practices, and about particular loans, before any conclusions are drawn. Examiners consider - together with HMDA data - information derived from consumer complaints, risks apparent from various business lines, and the adequacy of the institution's compliance-risk management program.  Since examiners will be looking at the data, it would be advisable for a bank to make a review of the data a component of a comprehensive fair lending compliance program and Community Reinvestment Act strategy. In fact, examiners will look carefully at analyses of HMDA data performed by a bank and talk with the bank to understand the reasons for any disparities in lending patterns. The bank is probably in the best position to understand what the HMDA data suggest about its ability to reach prospective borrowers. Consequently, its own assessment is useful to an examiner establishing the fair lending examination scope. Examiners want to know how banks have addressed any disparities and how the bank's analysis has led to any changes in controls that were made to ensure that policies are followed. I want to emphasize that, as with compliance-risk management programs, the breadth of a banking organization's program and system review should be commensurate with the size and complexity of its operations, the range of its products, and the demographics of its markets.  Beyond this review of HMDA data, examiners evaluate whether an organization's fair lending compliance framework makes it possible to identify, monitor, and effectively control risks. Examiners are looking for a clear articulation by the board of directors of the institution's lending strategy, including defined risk parameters and the execution of appropriate risk-measurement and risk-mitigation initiatives. Examiners will evaluate the extent to which management controls reflect the risk associated with the institution's lending strategy.  As with the broader area of compliance-risk management, examiners will look closely at how the compliance culture established at the top of the organization filters down into the everyday responsibilities of business-line managers and how those managers are held accountable for compliance. Conclusion Because of the growing complexity of banking organizations, the Federal Reserve is currently considering whether more-tailored guidance in the area of enterprise-wide compliance-risk management is warranted. In the coming months, we will continue to engage with you to better understand your successful approaches to identifying, monitoring, and managing risk across your organizations. Thank you.

Timothy F Geithner: Implications of growth in credit derivatives for financial stability Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the New York University Stern School of Business Third Credit Risk Conference, New York City, 16 May 2006. *      *      * Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you today. We're in the midst of a period of rapid growth and innovation in the market for credit derivatives, and the developments in this market have important implications for broader financial market functioning and stability. A vital and efficient financial system such as ours is defined by its ability to identify new ways to allocate capital and share risk, but often the pace of innovation in the instruments themselves outstrips the pace of improvement in the risk management and control infrastructure. The credit derivatives market is no exception to this general observation. In my remarks today, I'll focus on some of the implications of these changes in the credit derivatives market for the stability of the overall financial system. As with any attempt to explore the broader implications of rapid growth in a new market, I'll say more about what we do not know than about what we do know. I'll also highlight the need for continued progress in addressing the challenges posed by the rapid growth in this market. Credit derivatives have contributed to dramatic changes in the process of credit intermediation, and the benefits of these changes seem compelling. They have made possible substantial improvements in the way credit risk is managed and facilitated a broad distribution of risk outside the banking system. By spreading risk more widely, by making it easier to purchase and sell protection against credit risk and to actively trade credit risk, and by facilitating the participation of a large and very diverse pool of non-bank financial institutions in the business of credit, these changes probably improve the overall efficiency and resiliency of financial markets. With the advent of credit derivatives, concentrations of credit risk are made easier to mitigate, and diversification made easier to achieve. Credit losses, whether from specific, individual defaults or the more widespread distress that accompanies economic recessions, will be diffused more broadly across institutions with different risk appetite and tolerance, and across geographic borders. Our experience since the introduction of these new instruments - a period that includes a major asset price shock and a global recession - seems to justify the essentially positive judgment we have about the likely benefits of ongoing growth in these markets. Despite the benefits to financial resilience, the changes in the credit markets that are the subject of your conference have also provoked some concerns and unease, even among those on the frontier of innovation and the most active participants in these markets. These concerns are based in part on uncertainty - a candid acknowledgment that there is a lot we do not yet know about how these instruments and the increased role of nonbank institutions in these markets will affect how the financial markets are likely to function in conditions of stress. Or to put it a bit differently: this concern comes from an awareness of the formidable complexity of measuring the scale of potential exposure in many of these instruments, and it comes from an awareness of the difficulty in anticipating how changes in credit market structure are likely to affect the behavior of financial market participants and market liquidity across a wide spectrum of financial and macroeconomic conditions. The velocity of change itself would not be particularly interesting if the scale of exposures involved were still small, but this is not the case today. Credit derivatives, although still only 7 percent of estimated total notional over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts, generate a significant fraction of total counterparty credit exposure. The direct counterparty credit exposure in OTC derivatives is quite large relative to the capital cushions of the major banks and investment banks, and relative to more traditional forms of credit exposure. Further, these exposures merit more attention because they may be harder to measure than those in the more mature interest rate and exchange rate derivatives. The underlying economic exposures involved are harder to assess in part because of the complexity of the instruments, the embedded leverage in many products and the difficulty of estimating correlations across different exposures. BIS Review 55/2006 1 
For these reasons, the risk individual dealers attribute to exposures involving some types of credit derivatives exhibit a very large variance, substantially larger than one would typically find in measurements of traditional credit exposures. That variance illustrates the magnitude of the uncertainty involved in capturing the direct exposure in these markets. But perhaps the more difficult challenge is to capture the broader risks the institution might confront in conditions of a general deterioration in confidence in credit and an erosion in liquidity in these markets. This task, which is the province of stress testing and analysis of very low probability but extreme scenarios, is, of course, fundamentally difficult. The analytical challenge is magnified by the inherent difficulty in predicting how behavior changes in crisis, that is, how investors and counterparties would react to actual losses and the fear of future losses. This challenge is substantially more difficult in markets where there have been dramatic changes in the instruments involved, in the nature of the participants and in the structure of the markets. We tend to look more closely at things we can measure than those we cannot. We are drawn to approaches that offer the comfort of precision and tend to look past the wide band of uncertainty that surrounds those estimates. Measuring these broader risks is harder today because the classic array of historical stress events drawn from the past 25 years of financial crises are probably even less valuable than they were as an illustration of how market dynamics might unfold today in response to similar changes in asset prices and credit losses. Those past crises would likely cause less damage today, if they were to recur, because of the many changes in the structure of our financial system - namely, the greater dispersion of credit and market risk, the improvements in risk management, the size of the capital cushions, and the improvements in many parts of the payment and settlement infrastructure. But most crises come from the unanticipated. Assessing a firm’s exposure to risk in the tail of the distribution requires, among other things, an evaluation of the impact of the failure of a major counterparty and the impact that failure might have on other counterparties and on market prices. It requires, for the largest institutions, an understanding of the constraints the firm may face in its ability to adjust positions or hedge against further losses without amplifying the shock. And it requires anticipating potentially adverse effects on market liquidity, as other market participants react to actual and anticipated losses. In the financial system we have today, with less risk concentrated in banks, the probability of systemic financial crises may be lower than in traditional bank-centered financial systems. And the increase in the diversity of nonbank financial institutions that hold risk may also serve as a stabilizing force in credit markets. But the greater relative importance of nonbank financial institutions also means that distress among these institutions has the potential to have a substantial impact on market behavior and liquidity. Understanding these relationships is an important part of the risk management challenge for banks, even in a world where derivatives have helped spread risk more broadly. The innovations that have taken place in the credit derivatives market were driven to a significant degree by the losses experienced in past crises, but most of the growth in this market has occurred in relatively favorable overall economic and financial conditions. This wave of innovation in credit markets has occurred in an environment in which: • the price of insurance against credit risk has fallen substantially as realized losses have declined and perceptions about corporate credit fundamentals have improved; • volatility has declined in many different types of asset prices, as have expectations of future volatility • the number of bank failures in the United States have fallen to levels not seen in a generation or more, and the price of protection against default by the largest financial institutions has fallen to levels that suggest a very low probability of failure; and • overall liquidity in markets has been high. Against the backdrop of an apparently healthy financial system, market participants report a substantial rise in transactions leverage, erosion in the use of loan covenants, more favorable financing terms for hedge fund counterparties, and especially a pressure to reduce initial margin against OTC derivatives exposure to hedge funds. But the concern is that this sustained period of very low credit losses and low volatility works to hold down measures of the underlying economic risk in these exposures. This combined with the range of factors I just discussed, raises the odds that market participants will be faced with negative surprises in the event of a more adverse macroeconomic 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
environment. And this could have more negative implications for market dynamics and liquidity as market participants react to those losses and attempt to reduce their exposure to future losses. These concerns are not particularly new, and my sense is that they are widely shared among the people and institutions that are closest to these markets. They do not, in my view, challenge the overall judgment that these changes in the credit markets on balance are likely to make the financial system more resilient rather than more fragile. But they do suggest the need for greater caution by financial institutions in several important areas. First, it is very important that the major dealers make the investments necessary to improve the operational infrastructure that underpins the credit derivatives and broader OTC derivatives market. Operational risk and infrastructure failures have played a prominent role in past financial crises, and the infrastructure weaknesses that have characterized the credit derivatives markets since their inception are an ongoing source of concern. The major market participants, both the dealers and the traditional and non-traditional investors, are in the process of improving the infrastructure that supports these markets. The changes underway to clean up the backlog of unconfirmed trades and to automate the entire post-trade-processing environment will help reduce operational risk in the derivatives market and reduce some sources of uncertainty that could exacerbate a market shock. The efforts underway to reach agreement on an approach for settlement in events of default are important for addressing the risks inherent in a market where the value of derivatives substantially exceeded the value of the underlying instruments. We are encouraged by the progress made to date, and will continue to encourage further improvements. Second, we believe that the major dealers, as well as the large commercial and investment banks, should take a cold, hard look at financing conditions and margin practice, particularly with respect to hedge fund counterparties and in OTC derivatives. The reports issued by the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Groups I and II both make the important observation that the financial system is likely to be more resilient under conditions of stress when counterparties set initial margins at levels that are likely to be sustainable in less benign conditions. When margin levels are set more conservatively, firms are likely to have more flexibility in responding to stress and are less likely to take action that might amplify the market shock and exacerbate the reduction in liquidity. When competitive pressure drives margins down, markets may be less resilient. Third, we believe the major financial institutions need to continue to improve their capacity to measure their exposure to risk in a less benign market and economic environment. The discipline of stress testing and scenario analysis that is designed to measure tail risk is at the frontier of this challenge. Senior management and boards of directors need to understand the limitations and uncertainty that pervade the tools we use to assess these risks, to try to better understand the potential scale of losses the firm may face, and to carefully examine how well risk exposures reflect the overall risk appetite of the firm, and the size of the capital and liquidity cushion maintained in relation to those exposures. Let me conclude by reiterating the fundamental view that the wave of innovation underway in credit derivatives offers substantial benefits to both the efficiency and stability of our financial system. The extent of these benefits will depend, in part, on the degree to which market participants can keep up with the pace of change in the market through continued investment in both risk management and in the processing infrastructure. We have been through a period of relatively favorable financial conditions, and the prospect for future stability will depend in part on the degree of care and conservatism market participants bring today to judgments about opportunity and risk management. Thank you. BIS Review 55/2006 3 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Extending the boundaries in the new financial landscape Speech by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the 10th Malaysian Banking, Finance & Insurance Summit: "Liberalisation and Consolidation of Malaysian Banking & Finance Sector: Enhancing Competitiveness & Resilience of Our Economy", Kuala Lumpur, 9 June 2006. *      *      * This decade has become one of the most dynamic periods in the development of our financial sector. We have seen the dramatic transformation of the financial structure to becoming increasingly more diversified, the industries becoming more consolidated and rationalized, and the system becoming more internationally integrated. We have also seen the financial system transition into a more competitive environment in which the institutional arrangements are more deregulated and liberalised. The financial infrastructure has also evolved with fundamental changes to support this transformation. Finally, the regulatory and supervisory approaches have also advanced to becoming more principled and risk-based to improve the functioning and stability of the financial system.  The financial transformation has taken place in an environment of economic stability. Malaysia 's economic performance has been characterized by sustained high quality growth and stable fundamentals. The underlying growth in the Malaysian economy has been solid. Malaysia has benefited from both the favourable external environment and the strong domestic demand. Malaysia has also benefited from the globalization of production with the geographical relocation of the production chain by an increasing number of both multi-national and local corporations across the Asian region. This trend has leveraged on the respective comparative advantages in countries of the region. Malaysia 's distinct capabilities in a wide number of areas has increased its participation in this process. In addition, increased economic integration following the rise of intra-regional trade and investment has brought mutually reinforcing benefits in terms of the expanding regional opportunities. The strengthened corporate sector has also led to increased direct investment abroad by Malaysian companies. Going forward, developments in the Malaysian economy will also benefit from the Ninth Malaysian Plan.  A major strength of the Malaysian economy has been its economic flexibility. Significant changes in the structure of the economy continues to take place. The manufacturing sector has continued to move up the value chain while the services sector has gained increasing prominence, with its share of GDP rising from 45% in 1995 to almost 60% today. The role of private consumption in the economy has also been enhanced, supported by steadily rising incomes, low unemployment, and access to the financial system. Of importance is the recovery of investment activity. In addition, the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increased their role in the domestic economy. New areas of growth are also emerging, ranging from the shared services and outsourcing industry to agro-business, biotechnology and Islamic finance. The flexibility of the economy to continually adjust to new areas of activity has been an important factor contributing to the dynamism of the economy.  About a year ago, Malaysia took the opportunity to transition into a more flexible exchange rate regime. This has been achieved in an orderly manner. Of importance was that the preconditions had been put in place to ensure this orderly transition. The banking sector had been strengthened, the bond market had been developed, and the capital account had been sequentially liberalised. These developments were reinforced by the further deregulation and liberalization of the domestic financial system, thus creating a more competitive financial environment. The successful transition to the new regime following these developments has seen a two-way movement in the exchange rate that reflects the underlying economy and the market conditions.  Monetary policy in this environment will continue to be conducted in a manner that will ensure that the long-term growth prospects of the economy is achieved with price stability. As a small, open economy, Malaysia is not insulated from the inflationary forces being felt globally. In this regard, decisions on monetary policy will be determined by the Bank's assessment of a broad range of indicators of the domestic economy. The Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) remains the signalling mechanism to achieve the policy objectives. Interest rates, therefore, is not an instrument to influence capital flows or the exchange rate.  The Bank continues to undertake initiatives to enhance communication to promote greater understanding of the objectives, processes and conduct of monetary policy. Extensive deliberations in BIS Review 55/2006 1 
assessing the latest domestic and global economic, monetary and financial developments are conducted at the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings, which are held eight times a year. The Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) remains the key monetary policy communication tool of the central bank to provide the rationale for monetary policy decisions.  Given the pronounced changes in the economy and the significant changes taking place in the financial sector, the industry would essentially need to respond to the new challenges arising from:  i. Greater linkages, integration and interdependence between nations. This trend is likely to intensify as more countries embark on initiatives to promote closer regional economic and financial integration, to enhance their level of economic performance.  ii. The challenge of intensified competitive pressures, arising not only from changes in the financial environment, the technological advancements and financial reforms but also the entry of new players, including the non-traditional competitors such as non-financial services.  iii. Consumers are increasingly confronted with a wide range of new and innovative products and services that are delivered via new and more efficient delivery channels. As consumers are becoming increasingly demanding and financially sophisticated, greater emphasis needs to be given to the provision of the variety and quality products and services at competitive prices through the most effective channels. Banking institutions need to anticipate and rapidly respond to these new demands and expectations.  iv. Policymakers are also confronted by the challenge of maintaining overall financial stability whilst at the same time, promoting efficiency in the financial system. Balancing the trade-offs arising from meeting these objectives will be necessary to determine the best course of action. This needs to be achieved while developing the financial infrastructure, in addition, to allowing for the entry of new players into the system.  v. The emergence of international players that possess the competitive advantage of being more technologically advanced with greater capability and capacity to offer more innovative products and services through new delivery channels will further intensify the competitive environment.  Despite its challenges, the changing economic and financial landscape also offers many opportunities;  i. New growth areas present new opportunities and financial institutions need to take advantage not only of the potential return but also the options for further diversifying the sources of income.  ii. Alternative sources of financing from the capital market, development financial institutions, as well as from non-bank sources such as venture capital funds, have increased significantly in recent years. Financial institutions need to develop new products and services that reinforce these developments and meet the new requirements of corporate consumers. This includes providing world-class financial advisory services and wealth management services.  iii. The emergence of new delivery channels such as the Internet and mobile phones have significantly altered the traditional banking-customer relationship. Business can be conducted seamlessly across borders. Technological developments have also transformed the payment systems industry, with the introduction of new payment instruments and entry of non-banks into payment services, facilitating the migration to e-payments. Market leaders can capitalise on these developments in providing products and services to customers and businesses.  The changing economic and financial landscape also brings about many opportunities for trade and investment. With the accelerating pace of regional integration, financial institutions are presented the opportunities to broaden beyond domestic borders to capture opportunities for the regional markets.  It has been more than 5 years since the Financial Sector Master Pan was launched. The strategic focus has allowed us to promptly emerge from the crisis management mode and moved full steam ahead towards developing the financial system, The initiatives undertaken have now laid a strong foundation for the development of a strong and diversified financial system. Significant progress has been achieved in building the capacity and capability of the financial sector and in putting in place the necessary financial infrastructure including the supporting legislation and the domestic financial markets.  2 BIS Review 55/2006 
The financial landscape and operating environment that is envisaged in Phase 2, where domestic banking institutions would have built greater capacity and capability to compete, is also progressing as planned. The level of competition in the financial system has increased significantly, fuelled by greater expectations from customers and facilitated by a more flexible regulatory framework and increased deregulation and liberalisation. This has resulted in improvements in the delivery of financial services and more efficient pricing and risk management, all of which contribute towards raising the level of economic performance.  The wide range of measures to improve efficiency and effectiveness of the financial institutions, include initiatives on improving risk management practices, further developing the human capital and building talents for the financial sector, as well as measures to elevate the level of consumer awareness. These efforts have further enhanced the ability of the financial system to respond to the changes that have occurred.  The banking sector recorded improvements on all fronts, enhancing the ability to compete effectively and strengthening the resilience to weather any potential adverse developments in particular, any external shocks to the system. The level of capitalisation remained consistently strong with the risk-weighted capital ratio of the banking system above 13% for the period concerned with quality of portfolio continuing to improve further amidst sustained economic performance.  The banking sector also continued to record strong profitability performance despite the increasingly competitive operating environment. In 2005, the banking system as a whole registered a pre-tax profit level of RM12.4 billion with a higher component of the revenue originating from service related activities such as the sale of wealth management products and remittance services, as well as from trading and investment activities. With this stronger performance and enhanced capability to manage risk exposures, several banking institutions have also taken the next step and moved forward to expand in the regional market to reach new sources of business opportunities. On the domestic front, there has been a narrowing of the gap as compared with the foreign banks.  Further initiatives undertaken include enhancing the operational aspects and delivery of services to banking consumers through the rationalisation of the configuration within respective banking groups. This has resulted in leaner and more effective entities where common functions and capabilities have been pooled leading to more cost-efficient entities as well as allowing for greater focus in the marketing and customer management. Following this rationalisation, the cost to income ratio of the domestic banks have improved from 55% in 2003 to 51% in the first quarter of this year.  On the aspect of improving customer interface and improving time taken to conduct banking transactions, branches have been redesigned with new business models. With this move, branch staff now have greater opportunity to provide value-added consultations and interface with clients. Increased investments have also been made to improve information systems - to be better positioned to understand customers' profiles and needs, as well as enhance overall risk management. Technologies such as data warehousing are now readily available to aid banking institutions to be more customer-centric and thus be more focused in their approach. As a result, more institutions have undertaken to offer greater product differentiation and value added services.  The robust growth in the Malaysian economy has also contributed to an increased demand for life insurance coverage. The growth in premium income has continued to outpace economic growth. Over the period 2000-2004, the market penetration rate increased from 31% in 2000 to 39% in 2005. The per capita spending on life insurance products also increased at an average annual rate of 10% over the same period. Notwithstanding this wider reach, life insurance coverage has remained relatively low compared with the more developed markets in the region such as the Republic of Korea, Singapore and Japan which reported penetration rates of more than 80%. Given the vast untapped market potential and the increased product innovation and new distribution channels, the life insurance penetration in Malaysia is expected to strengthen.  Demographic changes leading to a growing ageing population has been a growing concern in many countries. Given the trends in rising life expectancy and falling birth rates, responding to the increased challenges of retirement financing has been high on the nation's socio-economic development agenda. Going forward, there will be greater interest in private pension schemes representing an are of significant growth opportunities for life insurers.  The financial performance of the Malaysian insurance industry has also continued to be impressive during the 2000 and 2005 despite the challenging underwriting and investment conditions, with growth primarily driven by the life sector. Total insurance fund assets of the industry grew at an average BIS Review 55/2006 3 
annual rate of 13.8%. The insurance industry also increased in importance as a component of the economy and financial system. The ratio of total industry assets to nominal GNP rose from 16.1% in 2000 to 20.4% in 2005, while the ratio to total assets of the financial system continued on an upward trend from 4.0% in 2000 to 5.1% in 2005.  Moving forward, the Bank will step up its vigilance of the industry's state of readiness to cope with the changing environment. An orderly transition of the market-led adjustments is vital to ensure that the adjustments does not destabilize the market or undermine public confidence. To this end, efforts will continue to be directed towards building institutional capabilities and putting in place the necessary supporting financial infrastructure to provide a firm foundation for orderly change. Initiatives in the area of financial education for consumers will be intensified to further expand the coverage as well as to promote the fair treatment of consumers.  With a strong foundation in place to meet increased competition, further deregulatory and liberalisation measures will be introduced. This will include greater flexibility accorded to foreign insurers to establish branch offices, the progressive deregulation of pricing for tariff-rated insurance products, greater investment management flexibility and removal of limits on management expenses and continuing improvements in disclosure standards to promote greater market discipline in the more deregulated environment. On-going deregulatory measures will also further enhance the ability of insurers to respond more proactively and speedily to changes in consumer demands and market conditions. The prudential framework will also continue to be adjusted to establish principles of sound financial and business practices in the changing environment, with a significantly stronger emphasis on risk-based supervision and effective board and management oversight.  Further advancement towards greater international integration will be considered to provide Malaysian consumers with greater access to world-class products and services, while further catalysing the development of the domestic industry towards meeting international best practices and standards. This will include the issuance of new licences in specialized lines and greater opportunities for internationally-reputed insurers to acquire equity interests in, or forge strategic alliances with domestic players, both in the direct insurance as well as re-insurance sectors. The progression towards further deregulation and liberalisation will continue to be managed at an appropriate pace, taking into account the development of the supporting infrastructure and the level of substantive progress achieved by domestic institutions, in order to ensure market stability.  Next on the agenda in the development of the domestic financial system is the formation of investment banks. This is aimed at further enhancing the delivery of financial services to the wholesale and corporate sector. With this rationalisation, the business community will have a more streamlined access to banking services to fulfil their wider range of requirements. Comprehensive changes to the organisational structure of the development financial institutions have also been undertaken to provide a clearer scope and focus to service the needs of targeted sectors. At the same time, measures were also instituted to expand the role of the credit guarantee agency to further facilitate the development of the small and medium enterprises, a critical component of the nation's economy.  On the regulatory front, a series of enhancements to the risk management regulatory framework has been introduced with the aim of promoting a more robust and comprehensive risk management practices within banking institutions. In addition, significant effort has also been put in place to prepare the industry towards the implementation of Basel II, which is targeted for January 2008 for the standardised approach and January 2010 for the IRB approach. The industry has responded well - with various improvement measures that have been instituted, and investments made to enhance their systems and approaches to elevate their capability to manage risk exposures. This will contribute towards enhancing further overall financial stability, and towards the development of new products with better pricing of the financial services.  The Islamic banking and takaful industries have been among the most dynamic in the sector. In terms of assets, the annual growth rate of Islamic banking and takaful averaged 19 percent and 25 percent respectively. In 2005, profitability of Islamic banking surpassed the RM1 billion mark for the first time, while its assets breached the RM100 billion threshold. As of end-March, the Islamic banking assets accounted for almost 12% of the total assets of the entire banking system. The takaful industry's assets stood at about 6% of the industry total.  The Islamic banking industry has begun to maximise the competitive advantages of the Islamic banking concept of profit and risk sharing. We are seeing this concept more keenly being exploited in profit and risk sharing ventures, and Islamic fund and wealth management which are emerging as rewarding banking activities. Developing a pool of the required skills and talent, and putting in place of 4 BIS Review 55/2006 
proper risk management systems and good corporate governance practices becomes vital to sustain the growth momentum of the industry.  As we move towards the final phase of the Master Plan and into a more competitive landscape, we require robust financial institutions that are resilient, effective, efficient and well placed to serve the nation, and thus support sustainable economic growth and transformation. In the area of Islamic banking and finance, our aim is to be a leading international Islamic financial centre. To achieve this, we have to strengthen our position and focus our resources on achieving two broad aims. The first is to become an international leader in the origination, issuance as well as trading of Islamic capital market and treasury instruments, fund and wealth management services, offshore Islamic financial services, and takaful and re takaful . As a services sector, the robustness of the industry is a direct function of the calibre of the workforce in the industry. As such, our second goal is to position Malaysia as a centre of excellence for Islamic banking and finance education, training, consultancy and research. Not only will this provide a deep pool of highly trained and capable employees, it will also further promote the innovation of Islamic financial products and services.  In a dual financial environment, neutrality in treatment between Islamic and conventional financial products is important in order to create a level playing field. It also sets the stage for greater innovation to take place to support the development of the Islamic financial services industry going forward. With the strengthened and robust Islamic financial infrastructure firmly achieved in the first two phases of the FSMP, the Islamic financial services industry is poised to tap new growth opportunities and grow to its full potential. This will inevitably increase the breadth and depth of the Islamic financial market and, more importantly, strengthen Malaysia 's position as an attractive and dynamic international Islamic financial centre.  In preparing for the pressures of liberalisation and increased competition, continuous review of the regulatory framework and their implications on the efficiency and an environment conducive for innovation is taken into consideration. The cost and benefits of regulations are carefully weighed to ensure a well-balanced regulatory framework that meets prudential objectives yet remaining relevant and adaptable to the changing environment. Premised on this, the prudential framework is evolving towards a predominantly principle-based regulatory approach.  The underlying flexibility inherent in the principle-based approach would involve a regulatory framework that relies more on market discipline, where the market will be entrusted to allocate resources and risks, with greater reward for prudent practices. The emphasis is on self-regulation, where stronger corporate governance, integrity and transparency are critical for banking institutions to achieve investor confidence and public trust. Moving forward, as market discipline improves and both banking institutions and insurance companies are better positioned to undergo self-regulation, further deregulation can be expected. A differentiated regulatory approach will increasingly be adopted, where banking institutions and insurance companies that exhibit strong corporate governance and risk management practices will be given greater regulatory flexibility.  Whilst it is recognised that the regulatory framework should foster efficiency and competition, this has to be balanced with the objective of attaining soundness and preserving the stability of the financial system through the promotion of sound risk management practices. Commensurate with the diversity and complexity of products and services, the financial landscape of the future will require the continuous upgrade of the risk management practices with improvements in the governance standards and enhancing of information management systems. The rationalisation exercises aimed at maximising cost efficiency and reaping benefits of group synergies has led to the emergence of more complex group structures of more diversified financial conglomerates. In relation to this, a holistic and integrated regulatory approach is being adopted to ensure that the activities of these financial conglomerates do not introduce excessive risks to the financial system. Risk management standards are applied across the group and safeguards have been introduced to ensure risks are efficiently managed with necessary infrastructure for an overall view of the risk exposures within the group.  Fostering a customer-centric culture encompasses fair and equitable dealings with customers to engender greater trust and loyalty among customers and serving customers in good faith by extending products and services that are appropriate to their financial requirements and circumstances. Greater innovation must therefore be complemented by higher levels of service quality. Greater attention on excellence in customer service requires continuous investment in staff development, which will be a vital part of the process. Harnessing the technology to deliver distinctive customer experience that combines the right mix of convenience and value is also an essential part of the process. In addition, BIS Review 55/2006 5 
adequate emphasis and resources need to be accorded to protecting customers' privacy and safeguarding their interests.  In order to make a quantum leap forward, it is vital to continuously invest in human intellectual capital so as to create a pool of talent, skill and expertise that will drive the performance of the financial system. Skilled individuals are needed to be able to deliver high value-added products and services, adopt advanced business practices and have the necessary competence to build confidence in the financial market and trust of the consumer. Initiatives have been taken for putting in place specialised training organisations as part of the infrastructure for the development of highly skilled workforce for the financial sector. The International Centre for Leadership in Finance is now in its 3 rd year of operations and more recently the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance was established to meet the increased demands of Islamic finance professionals, both in the domestic and international markets. The programmes carried out by the Institut Bank-bank Malaysia and Malaysian Insurance Institute has also been reviewed to meet the demands of the financial sector.  Ladies and Gentlemen,  While Malaysia has approached liberalisation in a gradual manner, our track record has shown that the process is accelerated when it brings benefits to the country. Financial liberalisation has on several occasions been brought forward. In particular, liberalisation has been focused on the new areas of growth that is, in the insurance sector, in Islamic finance and in investment banking. New licences in Islamic banking to foreign financial institutions and larger foreign equity participation in both Islamic banking subsidiaries and takaful operators, and in investment banking of up to 49% is aimed at achieving a more internationally integrated financial system. While liberalisation in the traditional sector will continue, its already highly liberalised status and its higher level of capacity relative to the economy does not introduce urgency to the liberalisation compared to the new growth areas. These traditional sectors may lead to overcrowding. The focus of a more rapid liberalisation is where significant market development are likely to take place. Emphasis would be towards attracting foreign players who are recognised as specialist in a specific segment. This would also include new growth areas such as micro-financing or agricultural lending. The aim is to produce niche players delivering specialized value added products and services that will be able to cater towards specific segments of the market and over time, and thus develop a more comprehensive financial system that would contribute towards the development of a more diversified economy.  Given the background of emerging economies, the transition to a more liberalised environment would indeed demand appropriate sequencing of measures and careful management of the liberalisation process that are guided by broad principles that would ensure that there are benefits and opportunities brought about by the liberalisation process. The financial sector is an important and strategic sector that has a significant role in supporting the economic growth and transformation. Liberalisation needs to commensurate with the pace of economic development and strength of the regulatory structure to avoid destabilising effects on the stability of the financial sector and the overall economy.  Key considerations for the strategic opening up of the financial sector would be to steer the financial sector towards increased competition whilst ensuring domestic financial institutions are not marginalised by the liberalisation process. Liberalisation should instead serve as a catalyst for domestic banks to further improve their performance and enhance efficiency and capabilities in order to sharpen their competitive edge and elevate themselves to a level that is at par with the international players. Benefits of foreign direct investment are manifold ranging from efficiency gains brought about by new technologies to the introduction of innovative products and management techniques. Further, more advanced research and development facilities and adoption of best practices from more matured financial markets will contribute to the transfer of skills and knowledge, adoption of sound risk management culture, technology and ideas in the domestic financial system.  Another consideration in the liberalisation process is that of promoting financial inclusion, where all segments of society will have access to adequate financial services. The wide branch network of domestic banking institutions has ensured that non-urban areas have access to banking services, thereby eliminating the use of informal financial services. Domestic banking institutions with large presence in the non-urban areas, some as high as 20% of total branches, have succeeded in achieving sustainable performance while meeting this objective. Locally incorporated foreign banks are however located mainly in major cities and serve only certain segments of the banking public. A wider dispersion of branches of locally-incorporated foreign banks across the country would contribute towards achieving greater financial inclusion. For further expansion outside major cities to be a commercially viable proposition, it is recognised that the attainment of critical mass is essential. In this 6 BIS Review 55/2006 
regard, in addition to the flexibility accorded to establish up to four new branches, consideration will be given to allow for greater presence in the non-urban areas and to serve the segments of the economy which are currently underserved.  The banking sector is now in a prime position for the next step in evolution. The foundation for the development of a more efficient, effective and stable financial system has been laid. The task is now for the industry to move forward and undertake the necessary actions towards realising goals as envisaged in the FSMP. Nevertheless, this journey does not end in 2010. We should also look forward towards what lies beyond 2010. As an open economy, we should also be cognisant with the developments that take place around us. I believe that the Malaysian financial services industry is ready to take on this challenge to elevate the performance and standards of the sector. With this, I wish you a productive summit.

Panagiotis Thomopoulos: Banking regulation in Europe - a brief overview of current developments Speech by Mr Panagiotis Thomopoulos, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at an event organised by the European Bank Training Network and the Hellenic Bank Association, Athens, 4 May 2006.  *      *      * Good evening, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Allow me to begin by welcoming you to Athens and wishing you a pleasant stay. It is a great pleasure and honour for me to address such a distinguished audience. I would also like to seize this opportunity to thank the European Bank Training Network and the Hellenic Bank Association for organising this event and all of you for your participation. My objective here today is to provide you with a brief overview of the current developments in banking regulation that are taking shape in the European “arena”, and to outline the main challenges that European regulators and supervisors face, as the degree of integration in the European financial market increases. Before presenting you with some of my thoughts on this subject - a subject which, I am sure, all of you know well - I should like to say a few words about Greece, where I have a comparative advantage. Disciplined by the requirements of euro area candidacy and membership, Greece succeeded in lowering its inflation rate from over 16% in the fifteen years until almost the mid-1990s to just above 3% from 2000 onwards. At the same time, GDP growth rose from less than 1% in the first period to almost 4% over the last ten years. The Greek economic scene has also been transformed thanks to the advantages derived from euro area membership, including the stable macroeconomic environment and low interest rates. The Olympic Games hosted in Athens in 2004 contributed, in turn, to creating a favourable environment for growth. However, liberalisation and privatisations, as well as a reinvigorated private entrepreneurial spirit, have been the principal growth-driving forces. This spirit has manifested itself in Greece's re-orientation from an inward- to an outward-looking economy. We now see ourselves as a dynamic part of South-East Europe, where large Greek communities, numbering hundreds of thousands, after taking root in the distant past, continued over the centuries to play an important role in the economic and social life of their respective countries. The story of these communities goes back a long way, beginning in ancient Greece, followed by 5 centuries under the Roman Empire, then continuing for 1,000 years during Byzantium. Then came nearly 600 years of Ottoman rule and, more recently, the communist take-over of these countries, which resulted in an expulsion of all non-communist Greeks. After an interlude of some 50 years, the historic forces are back at work. More than 5,000 Greek companies now operate in the neighbouring Balkan countries and are among the main foreign investors in Bulgaria, Fyrom, Romania, Albania and, more recently, Serbia. This development has resulted in a delocalisation of Greek industry to our neighbouring countries and a steady inflow of migrant workers to Greece. The Greek banking sector has also undergone a radical transformation, evolving from the highly regulated sector it was 15 years ago, when the Bank of Greece set over 150 different levels of interest rates to become a free, competitive and dynamic sector and a key pillar in Greece’s successful economic performance. Despite their relatively small size by European standards, the Greek banks '  high profitability has enabled them to build sound foundations. Just like other sectors, the Greek banking sector has also expanded to South-East Europe. This offers Greek banks the opportunity to benefit from the growth potential of a rapidly developing region with low levels of financial intermediation, to increase their size and efficiency, and to continue to flourish in the very competitive international financial environment. The market penetration of Greek banks, based on their total assets in the neighbouring countries, ranges from 11% to over 30%. Moreover, the foreign claims of Greek commercial banks on the Balkan region countries have reached almost €11 billion, which represents 25% of Greek banks’ total foreign claims and 58% of their own funds. Unfortunately, the state of the Greek economy is far from rosy and many challenges still lie ahead. After euro area entry, fiscal discipline was relaxed and during the last five years the fiscal deficit has, in fact, worsened. Only this year has it been budgeted to fall below 3% of GDP, while continuous efforts will have to be maintained to reach a balanced position, as required by the EU. BIS Review 55/2006 1 
Moreover, the euphoria after euro area entry prompted a '' money illusion '' with labour unions demanding and obtaining high nominal wage increases, regardless of the impact on real incomes and unemployment, as a result of the the loss of external competitiveness. This makes it even more urgent and imperative to raise productivity growth further and develop high value- added activities. We, therefore, need to intensify our structural adjustment efforts in the labour and product markets, promote innovation and technology, and ease bureaucratic restrictions, as recommended in the Lisbon agenda. My personal opinion is that the morass of bureaucracy is the main impediment to a faster rate of growth. The Greek banking sector thus faces a double challenge: it has to apply all of the new regulations, control mechanisms and risk-based methods (Basel II), while expanding rapidly both in Greece and abroad, and, at the same time, from a risk management and internal control point of view, it has to rapidly integrate its subsidiaries and branches in South-East Europe, where the environment still differs from that of the average euro area country. Expansion toward potentially much larger markets - Turkey, Poland and Egypt today and Ukraine tomorrow - calls for even better internal risk exposure-monitoring systems. This is a parameter which the new capital adequacy framework, in combination with the recently established regulatory framework on internal control, deals with. The Bank of Greece, as the supervisory authority, has indeed been adapting its regulatory and supervision apparatus to deal with the new challenges, and has encouraged the banking sector to maintain a high Capital Adequacy Ratio (13% at the end of last year). This provides a more than adequate buffer against the fact that uncovered non-performing loans are still slightly higher in Greece than on average in the euro area and the fact that Greek banks are still benefiting from a favourable cyclical phase and, therefore, have not yet experienced the adverse effects of a slowdown. In parallel, given the specificities of Greece ' s banking system and economy, the Bank of Greece has imposed stricter measures on some banks (e.g. a CAR much higher than 8%). Likewise, given the rapid growth of lending to households (30% on average since 2001), the Bank of Greece has instructed banks that debt-servicing burdens on households should not exceed 30-40% of disposable household income. While adhering to the risk-based approach, which gives individual banks more freedom to estimate their possible losses and manage their own risks, the Bank of Greece considers that the supervisory authorities should always be alert (not to say, vigilant) and, when necessary, not only adjust the capital requirements of individual banks, but also periodically test the internal control mechanisms and risk management systems, in the context of Pillar III. Only as a last resort should other more direct measures be applied.  Current developments Now, getting back to the subject of today ' s conference: During most of the 1990s, efforts in the financial services sector were focused on achieving a smooth changeover to the single European currency. However, once the euro was successfully introduced, attention shifted to improving the functioning of the single European financial market. The late 1990s saw the launching of an ambitious plan - the Financial Services Action Plan - , which contained a series of legislative and other measures that would allow the European financial services sector to gradually realise its full potential. Since then, major changes have taken and are still taking place in the financial regulation landscape. The most outstanding of them, in the banking sector, is the forthcoming new capital requirements framework, which is one of the final measures of the EU Financial Services Action Plan.  The new capital requirements framework The new Directive - or CRD as it is called - will make the existing banking supervision framework more risk-sensitive and will promote enhanced risk management among financial institutions. This should improve the effectiveness of the framework in ensuring financial stability, maintaining confidence in financial institutions and supporting the macroeconomic environment in general. Improved risk-sensitivity in capital requirements should facilitate a more effective allocation of capital, thus contributing to boosting the competitiveness of the EU economy. There has, however, been some discordance of opinion about certain aspects of the CRD, which has fortunately been largely resolved. The new Directive is, in fact, a new supervisory framework of a rather revolutionary nature, adapted to the globalised world we live in. Apart from introducing new approaches for the calculation of capital requirements, the CRD provides for the establishment of intensive cooperation and information exchange mechanisms among supervisors, the option of delegating tasks among supervisors, information exchange requirements among banking supervisors, central banks and finance ministries 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
in emergency situations, and - a completely new element - disclosure requirements both for banks and for supervisors. Of the above-mentioned elements, one issue that has sparked much debate and, to some extent, controversy, is the allocation of supervisory tasks or responsibilities between the home and the host supervisor, i.e.: (i) the authority that supervises the parent bank (i.e. the consolidating supervisor) and the authority that supervises a ''significant'' subsidiary bank or (ii) the supervisor of the bank located in the country of origin and the supervisor located in the country where a ''systemically relevant'' branch is established. The main concern in this debate is finding the right balance, so as to enhance the efficiency of the supervisory arrangements, while ensuring their effectiveness and respecting the existing accountability arrangements at the national level. The Bank of Greece has a strong interest in the outcome of this debate, in which it actively participates, in the hope that an optimum balance will be reached. Needless to say, this interest also reflects the fact that the Bank of Greece is both the host supervisor for incoming EU banks and the home supervisor for outgoing Greek banks, which are expanding mostly to the neighbouring Balkan countries, some of which are preparing to implement the EU framework. In performing its roles, as mentioned above, the Bank of Greece consistently follows policies that encourage the European integration process and refrains from creating unnecessary administrative burdens or erecting other obstacles, without, of course, putting the effectiveness of its supervisory tasks at risk.  Other regulatory initiatives • In parallel with the preparation for the new supervisory framework ' s implementation, discussions are under way regarding the revision of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes and the Electronic Money Directive.  • Another major issue that has sparked considerable controversy concerns the so-called supervisory approval process. The debate was initially triggered by certain market participants, who fear it to be an obstacle to cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The Bank of Greece and the central banks of many other countries have repeatedly stated that isolated cases, in which a misuse of supervisory powers may have occurred, should not be generalised. In Greece, as it is the case in the EU as a whole, the supervisory authorities base their decisions regarding the merger or acquisition by a foreign institution of a domestic bank strictly on supervisory criteria.  The new decision-making structure for financial services Apart from the introduction of the new capital adequacy framework, another radical change that has been introduced involves the decision-making process at the EU level for the financial sector, also known as the Lamfalussy process. A new financial services committee architecture has been established. The Lamfalussy approach, which was originally elaborated for the securities sector, now extends to the banking and insurance sector, as well. Given the time constraint, an extensive presentation of the Lamfalussy framework would probably be inappropriate. However, there is reason to underline some of its main objectives, which are: • to develop regulation that can adapt quickly to new market developments and practices, support integration and enhance EU competitiveness, and  • to strengthen cross-border and cross-sector cooperation among supervisory authorities and the convergence of day-to-day supervisory practices and implementation.  It is worth mentioning that the new decision-making structure has not yet reached its full potential. On the one hand, there is a some concern about the potential proliferation of work among the various committees and working groups and the consequent risk of confusion and wasted resources. On the other hand, the process has started to yield significant benefits, especially in the field of supervisory convergence, which should overcompensate for few negative aspects.  BIS Review 55/2006 3 
The Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) The CEBS, as part of the Lamfalussy framework, is the institutional committee that brings together all the banking supervisors of the EU countries and the central banks, including the ECB, as observers. The CEBS has three main tasks: • to provide advice to the Commission; • to ensure the consistent implementation of Community legislation in the banking sector and the convergence of supervisory practices; and  • to promote supervisory cooperation and exchanges of information. The CEBS has an advisory role within the EU legislative procedure. The CEBS’s other focus is to promote a consistent approach to banking supervision through increased convergence of standards and practices and enhanced cooperation and information sharing. The ultimate goal is to build a common supervisory culture and a practical operational network of banking supervisors within the established EU legal framework. This is of particular importance for the efficient supervision of cross-border banking groups, as the appropriate dissemination of information relating to risks and the elimination (if possible) of work duplication are expected to reduce the administrative burden and costs for the supervised institutions, while reducing the strain on supervisory resources. This does not mean that there are no benefits for smaller institutions, with a predominantly domestic or even local focus, as convergence will imply the establishment of a level playing field across the EU.  Next steps Changes in the regulatory framework and the organisational structure of the decision-making process are necessary but not sufficient conditions for the realisation of the EU financial market ' s strong growth potential. This can be more easily achieved if financial integration is accelerated. This belief is the driving force behind the new EU financial services strategy for the next 5 years, which is currently under discussion among the EU institutions, while, at the same time, market participants are being consulted. Up to now, the elements that seem to be part of this strategy and are closely related to the banking sector are the completion of certain ongoing projects (i.e. mortgage credit, consumer credit, the New Legal Framework for Payments, etc.) and the undertaking of new legislative initiatives (i.e. investment funds, bank accounts, credit intermediaries). One of the legislative initiatives that requires special attention is the proposal for a Directive on payment services. The proposed Directive, which is part of the wider Single European Payments Area Project, aims to establish a modern and harmonised legal and operational framework necessary for the creation of an integrated retail payments market, which would enable payments to be made more quickly and easily throughout the EU. The proposal also aims to introduce more competition in payment systems and facilitate the realisation of economies of scale. This will improve efficiency and reduce the cost of payment systems for the economy as a whole, an issue of high importance to the Bank of Greece, as electronic payments systems are not very much in demand in Greece.  Future challenges Supervisory architecture within the EU Lately, several discussions have revolved around the issue of the EU supervisory architecture, one of the arguments being that the complexity of supervisory arrangements increases in parallel with the growth of a banking group ' s cross-border activity. Without dismissing these concerns, we do not share the view that the conduct of cross-border activities is connected with a significant supervisory burden. On the contrary, the most important obstacles to the expansion of cross-border activity in the banking sector are the differences in the tax treatment of banking products among different states, cultural differences and the lack of proximity (except in the case of branches). Different views on the supervisory architecture advocate alternative models of supervision, ranging from complete centralisation to total decentralisation. Each approach has its own merits, but also raises a number of complicated strategic and operational issues that need to be addressed. 4 BIS Review 55/2006 
I believe that in no way should extreme solutions be adopted and instead implement the Lamfalussy approach, which though is not a panacea, has the definite advantage of allowing for a lot of flexibility. First of all, it provides for a range of different degrees of centralisation in the regulatory process, which would entail a more or less harmonised set of rules depending on the issues that need to be addressed. In this way, it facilitates the swift adaptation of community legislation to new developments in the financial markets, which in many cases have cross-sectoral dimensions. Moreover, it boosts regulatory and supervisory convergence while at the same time allowing for the efficient handling of differences arising from the fact that the vast majority of the 8,000 credit institutions in the EU operate domestically and sometimes even locally, in markets with diverse characteristics and which can better be assessed by local supervisors, as the history of the last 50 years has taught us. In this context, I think that we can go a long way with the Lamfalussy framework. And I do not think we are anywhere near the stage where we can say that we have fully exploited all the possibilities it has to offer, at least in the banking sector. In addition, the Lamfalussy framework and the way it is applied will evolve over time in response to the evolution of markets.  The Eurosystem’s perspective I would like to conclude my speech with a specific reference to the Eurosystem's perspective of the above-mentioned regulatory developments. It is worth noting that the Eurosystem's primary relevant concern stems from the fact that it is responsible for monitoring financial stability in the euro area, and at the same time recognises that a smooth-functioning financial system is a vital transmission mechanism for ECB monetary policy. Within this context, the forthcoming implementation of the new capital requirements framework, as well as the strengthening of supervisory cooperation within the EU, are seen as particularly encouraging developments, as they considerably enhance the existing financial stability framework. Of course, as the financial market landscape changes and the degree of European financial integration increases, new concerns are likely to arise, regarding, for instance, the ability of the system as a whole to respond to a possible emergency situation in a timely and effective manner. The Bank of Greece, as a member of the Eurosystem, keeps a close eye on developments, while participating actively in the respective discussions within the EU institutions for the establishment of common arrangements.

Mark W Olson: Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  Testimony by Mr Mark W Olson, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington DC, 13 June 2006. *      *      * Chairman Bachus, Representative Sanders, and members of the subcommittee, I am pleased to be here to discuss the uses and significance of the home loan data that are collected, reported, and publicly disclosed under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The act, which I will refer to as HMDA, was enacted over thirty years ago. Since then, it has undergone major changes. Today, HMDA requires most home lenders, a substantial majority of the home loan market, to disclose selected information about the applications they receive and the loans they extend each year. This information can be used for at least three purposes: first, to help the public judge how well lenders are meeting the housing-credit needs of their communities; second, to facilitate efficient investment in housing and neighborhoods; and third, to enhance the enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination in lending. HMDA promotes these goals through disclosure rather than substantive mandates or restrictions. The act does not direct lenders to make loans to any particular areas or persons. Nor does it direct lenders to make particular kinds of loans or to refrain from any particular loan terms or practices. Instead, HMDA prescribes lender disclosures that, taken together, form a public data set about lending patterns. Every reportable application for a loan occupies a unique line in the data set. In 2005, there were approximately 31 million reported loan applications. The information disclosed about each application includes the race, ethnicity, and income of the applicant, the type and amount of the loan applied for, whether the loan was originated or the application was denied, and the census tract of the property to be financed. For the public’s convenience, summary reports of the data are published by metropolitan area and by institution - for almost 9,000 depository and nondepository institutions. These summary reports are compiled by the Federal Reserve Board on behalf of the agency members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The Board also processes and edits the transaction-level data, which the FFIEC makes available to members of the public, who may analyze and compile the data as they see fit. The information disclosed under HMDA constitutes a rich data set, but, of course, all data sets have their limitations. The HMDA data tell a great deal about lending patterns, but they do not tell the entire story. Nonetheless, by drawing attention to lending patterns, the data prompt discussion, investigation, analysis, and research that may deepen our understanding of why these patterns occur and allow us to increase fairness and efficiency in the home loan market. For example, in 1991, congressional amendments to HMDA resulted in the disclosure of data that, for the first time, revealed black and Hispanic applicants for mortgage loans were far more likely than non-Hispanic white applicants to have their applications denied. The publication of those data precipitated an important public discussion about the underlying causes - and about whether unlawful discrimination was one of the causes. That discussion helped bring about new initiatives for compliance and community development. Many lenders improved their lending policies and developed strong compliance and oversight programs. Lenders also expanded their outreach to underserved communities, often by strengthening ties with community-based organizations. The data also prompted supervisory and enforcement agencies to improve their fair lending oversight programs. In short, though denial disparities have persisted, HMDA’s disclosure of those disparities has helped to increase the fairness and efficiency of the home loan market. Last year we passed another HMDA milestone when the first loan-level information about mortgage loan prices was released. The public discussion that the release of these data has prompted is reminiscent of the discussion that took place after the initial release of loan-denial data fifteen years ago. Today, the focus of the discussion has shifted from which consumers get home loans to the terms on which consumers get home loans - but the essential concern about the possible role of illegal discrimination is the same. I believe that the current public discussion about the new data will ultimately further the goals of fairness and efficiency in the mortgage market by prompting additional research, enhanced compliance and enforcement efforts, and more-effective investment in community development and financial literacy. BIS Review 55/2006 1 
The Federal Reserve has responsibilities that relate to each of these areas. In my testimony today, I will discuss four roles of the Federal Reserve that relate to the HMDA data. First, the Federal Reserve Board was entrusted by Congress to write implementing rules for HMDA. Acting in that capacity, the Board required lenders to report loan-price data. Second, as a supervisor of financial institutions, the Federal Reserve uses HMDA data, including the price data, to facilitate its supervision of institutions for compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination in home lending. Third, as a research institution, the Federal Reserve conducts and publishes analyses of the price data, and it encourages research by other parties as well. Fourth, the Federal Reserve supports efforts by other organizations to use the HMDA data to identify financial education and community development needs. The Federal Reserve also supports their efforts to respond to those needs. The Board’s decision to collect price information As I have said, it is a Board regulation, adopted under authority of HMDA, that requires lenders to disclose loan-price data. I will now provide some background on the Board’s decision to amend that regulation to include price data. Advances in information processing technology have expanded access to credit and homeownership opportunities for consumers. In the past, individuals seeking credit to purchase a home, or seeking to borrow for some other reason, either did or did not meet the specific underwriting criteria for a particular loan product; if they did, everyone paid about the same price for that product. Today, in part because of advances in credit scoring and underwriting technology, lenders can price loans according to risk, charging different borrowers different prices on the basis of a borrower’s estimated creditworthiness. The enhanced ability of lenders to assess credit risk gave rise to a segment of the mortgage market often referred to as subprime lending. In the subprime market, higher-risk borrowers pay higher prices. Subprime lending has grown rapidly, from less than 5 percent of all mortgage lending in 1994 to an estimated 20 percent in 2005, or over $600 billion. The wider range of loan pricing available in the subprime market helped to expand consumers’ homeownership opportunities and to increase their access to home equity. But this same price variability has raised concerns about unequal treatment of borrowers. It also has raised concerns about whether certain loan terms and lending practices are appropriate, whether consumers have the ability and knowledge to shop for the most beneficial loan terms, and whether the subprime market is sufficiently competitive. The Board responded to these concerns by amending Regulation C, the regulation that implements HMDA, to expand the available data on higher-priced lending. The data released by the FFIEC in September 2005, which covered lending activity in 2004, contained the first loan-level information on loan pricing ever available to the general public. The data contain price information for loans whose prices exceeded thresholds set by the Board. The thresholds were selected to target segments of the home loan market that have raised the most concern, taking into consideration the cost and burden of reporting. The thresholds generally correspond to an unofficial line separating the prime and subprime markets. But that line of separation is not always clear, and its correspondence with the reporting thresholds is in any event imprecise. Therefore, we call loans whose prices exceed the reporting threshold "higher-priced loans" rather than "subprime loans." This is only the second year in which price data will be publicly available under the Board’s regulation. The Board continues to monitor the effects of the regulation in an effort to understand both its benefits and costs. The Federal Reserve’s use of HMDA data in fair lending supervision I have spoken of the Federal Reserve’s role as the agency charged with implementing HMDA through regulations. The Federal Reserve also has a role as a supervisor of bank holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. In that role, the Federal Reserve has long used HMDA data to help it supervise financial institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws. The new data on higher-priced loans are yet another "screen" to make our fair lending supervision more effective. The Federal Reserve also shared analyses of the 2004 price data with other supervisory and enforcement agencies to assist them with their oversight of the institutions they supervise. Before I discuss how the HMDA screen fits into the process of fair lending supervision, I want to describe that process more generally. Fair lending reviews are an integral part of the Federal 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
Reserve’s supervision for consumer compliance and are performed regularly within each examination cycle. In addition, examiners may conduct targeted fair lending reviews whenever circumstances warrant. Moreover, the Federal Reserve examines institutions’ compliance with fair lending laws regardless of whether they report price data under HMDA. Indeed, the Federal Reserve was examining for potential price discrimination well before it adopted the HMDA price-reporting requirement. Although price reporting under HMDA is limited to higher-priced loans, examiners look for unlawful price discrimination at any pricing level. Furthermore, examiners seek to detect other forms of discrimination, such as underwriting discrimination (for example, denying credit on the basis of the applicant’s race) or redlining (for example, denying credit on the basis of the racial characteristics of the applicant’s neighborhood). Federal Reserve examiners use an institution’s HMDA data, including its accept-deny data for loan applications and any price data it may have reported on originations, in conjunction with other information about the institution to determine the focus of the institution’s fair lending examination. The HMDA data are incorporated into statistical management systems that produce analyses of lending patterns that aid the examination process. Starting in 2005, these analyses incorporated loan-price data. Other information that examiners use includes consumer complaints, the likely risks of an institution’s different business lines, and the adequacy of the institution’s compliance-risk management system. To gauge the risk of price discrimination, examiners consider, among other types of information, the presence of broad employee or broker discretion in pricing and the relationship, if any, between pricing and the compensation of loan officers or brokers. When examiners determine that a fair lending examination should focus on pricing, they collect additional information from the institution to evaluate whether pricing disparities can be fully attributed to legitimate factors or whether they are due, even in part, to unlawful discrimination. If unlawful discrimination is found, the institution is referred to the Department of Justice or the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as required by law. Depending on the outcome of the referral and the nature of the violation, the Federal Reserve may also take other action to fully resolve the matter. For example, the Federal Reserve may direct the institution to provide remedies to harmed parties and improve its fair lending compliance controls and policies. As the Federal Reserve has stated repeatedly, using the price and other HMDA data effectively in the supervisory process depends on a full understanding of the inherent limitations of those data. The HMDA data include valuable information, such as applicant or borrower income, loan amount, and the location of the property to be financed, but the data do not include many factors that lenders routinely consider in loan underwriting and pricing. Some of the typical credit-risk factors not included in the HMDA data are credit scores and loan-to-value ratios. Because the HMDA data lack such information, we cannot conclude from the HMDA data alone that an observed racial or ethnic difference in the prices of loans is the result of unlawful discrimination. That is why Federal Reserve examiners consider additional information about a lender, including information about its loan products and lending practices and its borrowers’ creditworthiness, before drawing conclusions about the lender’s compliance record. In addition to improving fair lending supervision and enforcement by government agencies, the new pricing data have spurred institutions to improve their own compliance. Although examiners have long considered institutions’ mortgage pricing as part of the fair lending review process, public disclosure of this pricing data appears to have given additional impetus to institutions’ compliance efforts. Many institutions have reexamined their pricing policies and procedures to ensure that they do not permit, even inadvertently, pricing differences that violate the fair lending laws. Many institutions have also reevaluated their controls to ensure that proper policies are followed. This increased attention by institutions to their own fair lending compliance is one of the principal benefits of HMDA. Research by Federal Reserve staff and others Supervision for fair lending compliance deals with lending patterns at the institution level. But the HMDA data also reveal lending patterns at aggregate levels, across institutions. Disclosure of aggregate patterns can raise and focus attention on important policy questions concerning access to credit. To that end, researchers at the Federal Reserve have published numerous papers and articles. BIS Review 55/2006 3 
Most recently, staff published an article about patterns in the new loan-pricing data.1 I will review a few of their findings. First, most home lenders make few, if any, higher-priced loans. In 2004, only about 500 out of the 8,850 reporting institutions made 100 or more higher-priced loans; the ten lenders with the largest volume of higher-priced loans accounted for about 40 percent of all such loans. (The FFIEC has not finished reviewing, processing, and editing the 2005 data, which were submitted in March of this year.) The 2004 data also show that 16 percent of borrowers took out higher-priced loans that year in the nation as a whole. This proportion may have increased from 2004 to 2005. For most loans, the Board’s regulation uses long-term interest rates to set the thresholds for reporting loan-price data, but mortgage loan rates more closely track short-term rates. Thus, a narrowing of the difference between short-term and long-term rates, such as occurred from 2004 to 2005, may increase the proportion of loans reported as higher-priced loans.  The proportion of borrowers obtaining higher-priced loans is not geographically uniform but varies widely by region and by city. For example, in many of the metropolitan areas of the South and the Southwest, 30 percent to 40 percent of homebuyers taking out conventional loans in 2004 took out higher-priced loans. In other areas of the country, the proportion was much smaller. These differences may not be that surprising - other data show that credit scores tend to be lower on average in the South and the Southwest than elsewhere - but they may nonetheless warrant further analysis. Of course, public attention has focused on a notable variation in the incidence of higher-priced lending across racial and ethnic lines: blacks and Hispanics are much more likely than non-Hispanic whites to receive higher-priced loans. In 2004, 32 percent of black borrowers and 20 percent of Hispanic borrowers received higher-priced home purchase loans, but only 9 percent of non-Hispanic white borrowers did. In other words, black homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than three times as often as non-Hispanic white homebuyers, and Hispanic homebuyers received higher-priced loans more than twice as often as non-Hispanic whites. Certainly, differences of this magnitude are disturbing and raise important public policy questions. They also have led some to conclude that racial discrimination must play a role in the pricing of home loans. However, for the reasons I have explained above, we cannot use HMDA data alone to judge whether an institution has discriminated unlawfully or, therefore, whether unlawful discrimination is present in the market. Despite their limitations, the HMDA data supply a key insight into the aggregate disparities: they reflect in part a segmentation of the market by race and ethnicity. Black and Hispanic borrowers are more likely to obtain mortgage loans from institutions that tend to specialize in subprime lending. Now, at least part of this segmentation of the market by race and ethnicity may reflect objective differences in borrowers’ preferences or differences in credit-risk indicators, such as credit scores, that are not included in the HMDA data. Yet the segmentation may have more troubling causes, at least in part. Segmentation may stem from borrowers being steered to lenders that charge higher prices than what is warranted by the credit characteristics of these borrowers. Borrowers may also have different levels of financial literacy, or their knowledge of the mortgage lending process may be uneven - for example, they may not understand the importance of shopping and negotiating for the best loan terms. Additional research is needed to explore all of these, and perhaps other, hypotheses. The Board will continue to conduct and promote research that explores the racial and ethnic differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending. In June and July, the Board is conducting hearings on the home equity lending market. These hearings, which I am chairing, are intended to gather information about, among other things, how consumers select their lenders and loans. The Board’s 2007 biennial community development research conference will also provide a forum for research that may help explain differences in the incidence of higher-priced lending.                                                       1  Robert B. Avery, Glenn B. Canner, and Robert E. Cook (2005), "New Information Reported under HMDA and Its Application in Fair Lending Enforcement," Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 91 (Summer 2005), pp. 344-394.  4 BIS Review 55/2006 
The Federal Reserve’s promotion of community development and financial literacy I have discussed the Federal Reserve’s roles in regulation, supervision, and research. Now I will turn to its role in promoting community development and financial literacy. The Federal Reserve System uses HMDA data to help banks, community organizations, and other interested groups identify community development needs and opportunities. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston tabulates HMDA data for the New England region to help regional financial institutions, community organizations, and state and local governments access and use information about their area’s regional lending patterns. In addition, the Community Affairs Offices of the Federal Reserve System encourage and facilitate collaboration among financial institutions, governments, and community organizations to improve access to mortgage credit in traditionally underserved communities.  The Federal Reserve also promotes financial literacy. Board staff provide strategic advice on developing financial literacy policies, programs, partnerships, and marketing to national initiatives, such as the Jump$tart Coalition, Operation HOPE, and the DollarWi$e Campaign of the Conference of Mayors. In a parallel effort, the Federal Reserve Banks support similar regional initiatives. The Federal Reserve also collaborates with other groups on research to develop successful financial education programs and identify the most effective way to deliver these programs to intended audiences. By these and other means, the Federal Reserve seeks to address gaps in consumers’ understanding of not only home loan transactions but also financial management more broadly. These gaps in consumer understanding may be contributing to disparities in the availability and price of home loans. In closing, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the Federal Reserve’s regulation requiring lenders to disclose price and other data on home loans; how the Federal Reserve uses the data to improve fair lending supervision; and the Federal Reserve’s promotion of research, community development, and financial literacy.

Timothy F Geithner: Principles to guide the future evolution of financial supervision and regulation Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Bond Market Association's Annual Meeting 2006, New York, 19 May 2006. *      *      * Thanks for inviting me to speak to you today.  You are meeting at a time of significant confidence in the strength of the global economy and in the overall health of the financial system. On the available evidence, the core of the U.S. financial system is stronger than it has been in some time. Capital levels are higher and earnings stronger and more diversified.  This strength is the result of many factors. It is the result of the length and strength of the economic expansion in the United States and the associated improvements in credit fundamentals. It reflects increases in the scale and scope of the operations of the largest institutions. It is the result of the dramatic innovations in the technology of finance and in the opportunities that has created for managing risk more effectively. And it reflects the increased integration of national financial institutions and the resulting competitive pressure and opportunities for diversification.  We have seen substantial improvements in risk management practice and in internal controls over the past decade. These improvements are the product of large investments in people and technology, as well as changes to the internal architecture around control and compliance. These investments were, of course, driven by a series of important changes in law and regulation, but they also reflect a rational response by the institutions themselves to the financial and reputational damage associated with some of the earlier weaknesses.  The progress achieved in internal control regimes has of course come with some costs. Many of these costs can be measured in dollars, but others, such as management attention and the uncertainty induced by greater vulnerability to enforcement action and litigation, are more difficult to measure. Despite the difficulty of adding up all these costs, it is hard to challenge the widespread view that they have been quite substantial. But the relevant metric is not merely their magnitude, but how they compare to the magnitude of the resulting gains.  There is no straightforward way to make this assessment, but today I want to offer some perspectives on our continued efforts to balance critical financial stability objectives with the need to foster and encourage the innovation and dynamism that is such a central part of the U.S. financial system.  I’ll begin with the observation that profitability measures suggest that the business of financial intermediation is reasonably healthy, despite the costs induced by changes in the regulatory environment. Part of this reflects the reduction in credit costs and increased macroeconomic stability of the past several years. The financial performance of the well-run U.S. financial institutions seems to compare favorably to that of their peers in other markets.  The pace of innovation in U.S. financial markets has continued to be robust. The explosive growth in the volume and type of credit derivatives is only one example of the overall creativity and dynamism of U.S. financial markets in recent years. This suggests that the incentives and opportunities for innovation in our markets remain powerful despite concerns about the impact of changes in the overall regulatory environment.  And confidence in the integrity of U.S. financial markets seems to be strong today - integrity in the sense of reduced vulnerability to illicit activity and improvements in the reliability of public disclosure. We can see evidence of this confidence in the apparent willingness of the world’s savers to invest in the United States and in the scale of capital formation in our markets.  The apparent robustness of market activity and innovation in the face of fairly substantial changes in the legal, supervisory and enforcement environment is encouraging. But the cumulate effects may take years to manifest themselves fully. Therefore, the official community has to be very attentive to the risk that we have the balance wrong.  BIS Review 54/2006 1 
I thought I might outline some broad principles that should guide the official community as we apply the existing body of regulation and supervisory guidance, as we refine current proposals, and as we design future changes.  It is imperative that we get it right. The efficiency, dynamism and resilience of the financial system are strategic assets for U.S. economy. The relatively favorable performance of the U.S. financial system is the result both of the wisdom of past choices made to foster a very open and competitive financial system, but also is the result of good fortune and some of the special advantages that have come from the unique role of the United States and the dollar in the world economy and financial system.  Some of these relative advantages are likely to decline over time with the maturation and deregulation of other financial markets around the world. And this healthy evolution prompts us to be even more attentive to the potential risk that the costs we impose on financial institutions in our markets and on companies that want to raise capital in our markets become prohibitively high.  Here are a few considerations or principles that I believe should guide us in the official community as we strive to improve the regulatory framework going forward. I want to emphasize that these principles, as in the case of many principles, are easier to state than to achieve. Let me start by acknowledging there are aspects of the exacting standards we have sought to impose on our financial system that have turned out to be expensive in relation to the return against our public policy objective. And provisions that seem optimally designed at any given time are likely to need to evolve as conditions change. That this should occur is a natural aspect of a dynamic financial environment. There are areas where we are likely to have erred in being too prescriptive and others where we left too much room for discretion and judgment. It would be good if we could find a way to build into the initial design of guidance and regulation the capacity for quicker and continuous evolution as we learn more.  Second, we need to continue to adapt our approach to the imperatives of a much more integrated global financial system. Global integration, of course, gives us all a greater stake in the quality of supervision outside our borders. This pragmatic interest will lead us to spend progressively more resources and attention on the international dimension of our work. This recognition informed the efforts that led to the Basel Capital Accord, the Lamfalussy Standards for payment and settlement systems and many other international cooperative efforts. But the imperative is much stronger today because of the much greater extent of financial integration, and it is only likely to grow.  It is also important that the design of regulatory initiatives in the United States be informed by a careful assessment of their relative impact on U.S. institutions and markets. Effective solutions to many of the concerns we face in our national financial systems will require multilateral approaches. Rather than starting with a presumption that we will act in the United States and then hope to induce the world to follow, there are some areas where the more effective approach will be to start with the borderless solution by which I mean one designed to apply to a class of institutions and financial instruments, independent of geography and currency. Where this does not prove possible on terms or in a time frame we like, we of course preserve the option to move alone.  Third, we live in a financial system in which nonbank financial institutions play a much larger role than they did in the past, a system in which the differences between the activities of the bank-centered financial institutions and nonbanks has diminished, and in which the largest commercial banks and investment banks compete with each other and with other nonbank institutions in both the United States and abroad.  These changes in market structure have many positive implications for financial efficiency and stability, but they also mean that differences in the size and nature of the incentives faced by institutions with different supervisory and regulatory regimes can have larger competitive effects. The resulting opportunities for regulatory arbitrage have the potential to reduce the impact of provisions that apply only to regulated or supervised institutions. The risk that regulating the core of the system simply pushes financial activity to the periphery can raise the risk that distress among nonbanks can cause greater damage to the financial system. This means that we have to look for ways to cooperate more closely with other supervisors across the functional lines of supervision in our system in such as way as to impact the incentives of a broader range of market participants.  Fourth, we need to find ways to accelerate the pace at which the regulatory framework evolves to meet new challenges. The increase in the pace of change in financial innovation and in market structure requires greater agility among supervisors and regulators. Without this agility we risk lagging too far behind changes in the frontier of risk. This does not mean that each innovation needs to be met 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
with a regulatory response. That would be an unfortunate and surely counterproductive impulse to encourage in regulation. But when a problem in the existing framework has significant implications for financial stability or efficiency, we need the flexibility and expertise required to act more quickly than we have been able to in some areas in the past.  Fifth, we need to be creative in identifying areas where market-led initiatives, rather than new laws, regulations or formal supervisory guidance, are likely to be successful and possibly more efficient in achieving certain policy objectives. Where collective action problems limit the incentive or the ability of individual institutions to make the necessary investments in infrastructure, the official sector can facilitate or motivate cooperative effort among market participants to solve the problem. At times, we may be more effective by helping to convene a group of market participants to reach consensus on best practices or a common solution than we would be defining or imposing a solution ourselves. Of course, not all problems are amenable to a solution by public support of private initiative, but we should be open to these types of approaches when they are likely to be successful in achieving our objectives.  And sixth, we have to be careful that the necessary and constructive attention that has been devoted over the past several years to meeting control and compliance challenges does not detract from the classic safety and soundness requirements of risk management. These should not be competing priorities. The financial costs and reputational damage associated with compliance and control failure can be very large. And the investments in the internal control infrastructure—in audit and corporate governance changes and in controls over financial reporting—are crucial parts of the foundation for a credible risk management framework. But we need to make sure that the demanding and ever evolving challenges of managing credit and market risk receive a degree of attention by senior management and boards that is commensurate with the risks. And this balance needs to be reflected in where we focus our supervisory efforts, as well. These classic prudential issues, those that make a critical difference in reducing the vulnerability of markets to systemic risk, need to be a principal focus of supervisory attention.  This is a time where I believe it is important to encourage more care and conservatism in the discipline of risk management. There are three areas at the top of our hierarchy of concerns.  First, it is very important that the major dealers make the investments necessary to improve the operational infrastructure that underpins the credit derivatives and broader over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. Operational risk and infrastructure failures have played a prominent role in past financial crises, and the infrastructure weaknesses that have characterized the credit derivatives markets since their inception are another credible source of concern.  The major market participants, both the dealers and the traditional and nontraditional investors, are in the process of improving the infrastructure that supports these markets. The changes underway to clean up the backlog of unconfirmed trades, to automate the entire post-trade-processing environment, and to improve the settlement process in events of default will help reduce operational risk in the derivatives market and reduce some sources of uncertainty that could exacerbate a market shock. We are encouraged by the progress made to date and will continue to encourage further improvements.  Second, we believe that the major dealers, as well as the large commercial and investment banks, should take a cold, hard look at financing conditions and margin practice, particularly with respect to hedge fund counterparties and in OTC derivatives. The reports issued by the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Groups I and II both make the important observation that the financial system is likely to be more resilient under conditions of stress when counterparties set initial margins at levels that are likely to be sustainable in less benign conditions. When margin levels are set more conservatively, firms are likely to have more flexibility in responding to stress and are less likely to take action that might amplify the market shock and exacerbate the reduction in liquidity. When competitive pressure drives margins down, markets may be less resilient.  Third, we believe the major financial institutions need to continue to improve their capacity to measure their exposure to risk in a less benign market and economic environment than we have experienced in recent years. The discipline of stress testing and scenario analysis that is designed to measure tail risk is at the frontier of this challenge. Senior management and the boards of directors need to understand the limitations of the tools we use to assess these risks, to try to better understand the potential scale of losses the firm may face, and to carefully examine how well risk exposures reflect the overall risk appetite of the firm, and the size of the capital and liquidity cushion maintained in relation to those exposures.  BIS Review 54/2006 3 
I want to conclude with the observation that the requirements of effective risk management and control regimes are likely to become more rather than less demanding over time. Those charged with managing the major financial institutions need to continue to make the investments necessary to stay abreast of change and to get as close to the frontier as possible. This reality makes it even more important that we in the supervisory community continue to look for ways to address aspects of the existing supervisory regime that impose unnecessary costs and burdens or that pull resources and attention away from potential sources of risk to the financial system.  Thank you. 4 BIS Review 54/2006 
Zhou Xiaochuan: Remarks on China’s trade balance and exchange rate Summary of remarks by Mr Zhou Xiaochuan, Governor of the People’s Bank of China, on issues related to China’s trade balance and exchange rate, at the China Development Forum sponsored by the Development Research Center of the State Council, Beijing, 20 March 2006. *      *      * Analysis of China’s trade surplus  1. The process of globalization, cross-border outsourcing and restructuring of supply chains has been accelerating in recent years, supported by IT revolutionary progress and the improvement of infrastructures. It now becomes possible to outsource those activities which would be difficult to outsource to foreign countries in the past.  2. There is a time lag in changing the layout of competitive advantages. Some labor-intensive production activities and services are usually outsourced to developing nations like China and India, while it will take a certain period of time before the developed countries (where the production cost is high) could create new jobs and develop new export advantages. Trade imbalance could expand during such a period of time lag. 3. FDI (particularly, of MNCs) has been playing a dominant role in cross-border outsourcing into China and in changing the landscape of trade balance. China has grown into a re-export processing center mainly by foreign-funded enterprises, with the supply chains increasingly expanded and value-added steadily enlarged. Exchange rate elasticity of such production and trade is fairly small. 4. From 1998 to 2004, China’s foreign trade was relatively kept in balance, with the annual trade surplus averaged between US$20 billion and US$30 billion. However, trade surplus suddenly escalated to US$100 billion in 2005, which could be mainly attributed to the slower growth of import in contrast to the steady growth of export (in 2005, export registered a growth of 28.4 percent while import increased by 17.6 percent). The slower growth of import was mainly caused by the declining import growth of equipments, a factor related to the structural adjustment of the Chinese economy. 5. FDI (particularly, of the MNCs) has drastically increased their production and sales in China, substituting China’s imports. There are numerous foreign branded or foreign-designed products sold in the Chinese market, but a large part of these products have actually been produced by the FDI companies in China. China’s exchange rate regime reform 6. China conducted a successful reform of the RMB exchange rate regime on July 21, 2005, which has won objective and positive responses from the international community. 7. The policy analysis and forecasts conducted before the reform has produced different views about the reform impact, therefore, we need some time to observe and collect data to assess and confirm the impact of the exchange rate reform on the domestic economy and employment etc. 8. Six months after the reform, most of the Chinese enterprises have adapted smoothly to the reform after undertaking painful restructuring, however a few sectors suffered severely from the exchange rate adjustment. On such a count, we may conclude that the market force could be allowed gradually to play a greater role in the floating exchange rate. 9. Over the past eight months, great efforts have been made by China to cultivate and develop foreign exchange markets. Trading products were enriched in the market, risk hedging instruments like forward and swap were developed, market makers and OTC transactions were introduced in the inter-bank foreign exchange market. The Chinese enterprises and financial institutions need some time to learn and adapt to the changes in foreign exchange market, so that they could be in a better position to keep in line with the flotation of exchange rate. 10. Over the past eight months, China has decontrolled some unnecessary foreign exchange restrictions. Actions taken in this respect included relaxation of controls imposed on foreign exchange retained and use of foreign exchange under capital account by the enterprises, facilitation of foreign BIS Review 54/2006 1 
exchange use by individuals under current account, and the exercise of applying comprehensive management of foreign exchange positions held by the banks. Through these efforts, the foreign exchange market will more objectively reflect the relationship between supply and demand of foreign exchange. Gradualist approach or shock therapy?  11. Due to the accelerating development of globalization, cross-border outsourcing and adjustment of supply chains as mentioned before, it is likely that it will take several years before the global trade could reach a new equilibrium. China as a large developing economy with heavy employment pressures and a still fragile financial system, could only adopt a gradualist approach to adjust its economy in a controllable manner. 12. The IMF has recently held a conference to discuss the global imbalances, and most of the participants believed that it was appropriate to pursue a gradual adjustment, and radical measures could result in unanticipated consequences. Besides, some participants suggested that the US has been too slow in making an internal adjustment. 13. Some advisors have prescribed the “shock therapy” to Russia and Eastern European countries, but later on this was described as “shock with no therapy”. We should be cautious to offer the same prescription again, so as not to have credibility jeopardized. China will only consider to take the gradualist reform approach that wins the trust of the masses of the Chinese people, rather than a “shock”, not to mention that the US has not taken the lead to use “shock” to adjust its imbalances. Global imbalances and the role of exchange rate  14. The Chinese government has already started to apply a mix of policy measures, including expanding domestic demand, lowering down saving rate, opening up the market, floating the exchange rate and increasing import, so as to improve the balance of payments. With the implementation of these policy measures, the PBC anticipates that it needs a time span of 2-3 years to achieve an approximate trade balance. However, what is worrisome is that, according to the analysis by the Chinese economists, even China basically realized a global trade balance, the United States might still incur large trade deficits and it would still be very difficult to achieve a bilateral trade balance between China and the US. So the ball would be actually not in China’s court. 15. The US and China should make joint efforts to address the trade imbalance between the two countries. When the Chinese government has been making an efforts as mentioned above trying to relieve the problem, complaints are also heard that the US has been slow in taking concrete measures to reduce its twin deficits and improve saving rate. 16. Some US economists assume that the exchange rate is the key to fixing the trade imbalance, while on the Chinese side there are economists from different schools and some also tend to believe in this assumption. However, such assumption failed in statistical test by using the trade data and real effective exchange rate recorded in China over the years. Besides, empirical knowledge about many other countries also does not support such a judgment. Therefore, we should be cautious to rely solely and excessively on exchange rate function to realize current account balance. 17. According to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, “member countries shall have the right to choose exchange rate regime, either free floating, managed floating or fixed exchange rate, at their own discretion”. In this sense, there exists no such an exchange rate regime that can be labeled as “manipulating exchange rate”. China’s gradual shift from a relatively fixed arrangement to an exchange rate regime with greater flexibility in line with the needs of economic reform and opening up has won extensive support from the world community, and those criticisms wrongly accused this action as “manipulating exchange rate” will not be widely accepted. 18. China’s trade balance should be assessed within a time framework of a number of years, not of a single year. And relevant statistics do not support the view that China gains trade advantages from the exchange rate. Japan has recorded large trade surplus continuously for many years, and yet the notion that Yen exchange rate has been manipulated is not accepted. 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
The duality between savings gap and trade imbalances 19. Savings gap equals to the difference between savings and investment, and trade imbalance equals to the difference between export and import. Macroeconomics describes the duality relationship between them. Excess savings will result in trade surplus, and vice versa. Therefore, it is important to view the problem of trade imbalance from the perspective of savings. 20. There are many different reasons behind the high saving rate in China. Some of them are related to the economic transition process while others are more associated with the social, cultural and traditional characteristics. Besides, the crowding out effect of FDI on domestic investment is likely to further increase excess savings in China. 21. The Chinese government now works on a broader perspective as well as more policy initiatives and strategies consistent with the national condition to expand internal demand, particularly the consumption demand. It also needs a certain period of time to realize such an adjustment. 22. The high saving rate and large stock of foreign reserves in Asia are related to the Asian financial crisis. Many Asians complained some hedge funds from the US during the crisis, and were also disappointed with the insufficient role and slow policy responses of the IMF to the crisis. These factors have made countries and households in Asia to rely more on their own to prevent risks. 23. Saving rate in the US has gone to the other extreme. Both the US and China need to make efforts to level their domestic demand and saving rate, otherwise, it would be difficult to resolve the trade imbalance. We are of the view that a certain priority should be given to orchestrated structural adjustments, and the function of exchange rate should not be too much expected. Foreign exchange reserves 24. After the exchange rate regime reform on July 21, 2005, there will be a time lag before the reform could have an expected impact on the development of current account balance and FDI in China, and the speculative factors are also unlikely to leave right away. Under the managed floating exchange rate regime, the PBC will gradually reduce its managing role in the foreign exchange market in line with the situation, which will lead to a slower growth of the foreign reserves. 25. After the Asian financial crisis, there emerged some new views and discussions with regard to setting a higher level as the rational foreign exchange reserve holding. These developments are also related to the severe shocks experienced and lessons learned by the crisis hit countries. 26. If two comparable countries have different sizes of external debts and different stocks of FDI, their foreign reserves should not be held at the same level. External debts need to be repaid, and FDI entails dividend remittances and they may even withdraw. Besides, some speculative hot money, if existed, could also seize the opportunity to exit at any time. All these factors bear some influences on the quantitative level of foreign reserve holding. If measured by per capita level, China’s foreign reserves are not high. WTO rules  27. The WTO mechanism has established game rules on a multilateral basis that enable all members to win; it is also a win-win game for China and the US. Although members may dispute regarding some imbalances, it at least gives a room for the differences to be resolved through negotiations. If anybody designs a lose-lose game for US and China, it hurts both countries, and designer himself will be in a dilemma whether the game should go on or not. Thus we have to choose and play a win-win game of free trade and anti-protectionism.  BIS Review 54/2006 3 
Baboo R Gujadhur: Preparations for implementation of Basel II Introductory remarks by Mr Baboo R Gujadhur, First Deputy Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, at the Seminar on Basel II, organised by KPMG, Mauritius, Port Louis, 25 – 26 May 2006. *      *      * Mr. Wilfrid Koon, Senior Partner Colleagues from KPMG Mauritius & South Africa Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen Good Morning. This is just a short speech to get you started on the 2-Day Seminar on Basel II organized by KPMG, Mauritius. I must say at the outset that I am very pleased with KPMG’s initiative to host this Seminar, which comes as no surprise being given that the firm is closely associated with the banking sector as auditors of banks. But the firm also needs to be commended for being the first among the auditing firms to organize a Seminar on Basel II for our local banking industry and for the audit profession. First, a few words to set out the reasons for Basel II. The Capital Accord of 1988, now referred to as Basel I, was a major step forward in so far as it embodied the principle that regulatory capital requirements should be based on risks being taken by each individual bank. Important as it was in this regard, Basel I with its rather crude method of assigning fixed risk weights to particular assets, failed to capture the responsiveness of capital requirements to risk. In a world that became increasingly prone to a serious risk of systemic failure, as illustrated by the East Asian crisis and other subsequent events including the LTCM crisis, a more risk-sensitive and comprehensive framework for assessing bank capital adequacy was called for, especially for large internationally active banks involved in complex transactions. After many years of discussion and several rounds of consultation, including with non G-10 countries, the Basel Committee came up with a new framework of principles for supervising the largest and most complex banking institutions. This has become known as Basel II. The core objective of Basel II is to promote the stability of the financial system by setting out the parameters on which to base the safe and sound operation of banks. By definition, financial intermediaries are here to take different levels of risk which they manage differently from each other. Banks remain at the heart of this system of financial intermediation, whether at the individual country or international level. As such, their safety and soundness has implications for financial stability, for consumers of financial services, for banks across the board, for regulators and for entire economies. In very simple language, Basel II sets out therefore a rigorous framework tying the amount of capital which a bank is required to maintain with its specific risk measurement and risk management capabilities in as much as capital is seen as the last line of defence a bank has recourse to in the event of unexpected loss from risk-taking. Even though Basel II was intended originally to provide a capital adequacy framework for internationally active banks, it was clear that, for diverse reasons, a number of countries and banks of various sizes and importance, would eventually embrace its principles for determination of capital adequacy. Several options – the Simple Standardized, the Standardized, Foundation and Advanced approaches – have accordingly been formulated in the menu of options available to accommodate a progressive adoption of Basel II. One of the direct impacts of Basel II adoption will be the wide scale use of quality information, data warehousing and credit risk modelling with a view to improving risk management by banks. Whichever approach is adopted, the regulator and the external auditor as well as Board and Management of banks, all have a duty to exercise oversignt over the processes of capital determination and, hence the precise risks being taken necessitating specific capital charges. In this context, a system of consistent regulatory practices has to be aligned with the way banks are run and managed and, in this sense, Basel II creates the scope for regulators to adapt over time to innovations taking place in the banks and the markets. Unless they apprehend fully concepts underlying processes for the estimation of Probability of Default (PD), Loss given Default (LGD), Exposure at Default (EAD) and the parameters employed to calculate risk of loss based on these concepts, inadequacies will surface up since the supervisory validation process will not be up to the mark in such a case. BIS Review 54/2006 1 
Conscious of this factor, we have been earnestly raising at the Bank of Mauritius regulatory capabilities to meet this challenge. I would like to say in this context that we have a fully motivated and competent professional team of regulators at the Bank who have been receiving for the last year and a half the necessary training to deliver effectively on this assignment. The key role that regulators have to play under Pillar 2 and the importance of public disclosure and accountability under Pillar 3 have generally not received the attention they deserve in the Basel II context. It is absolutely necessary to re-emphasize the critical importance of these two pillars in the Basel II implementation process. We are conscious that a whole process of prudential re-adaptation is called for in this respect by both banks and regulators. I may add that we are well on course, fully aware that Basel II is more than a simple framework for fixing an amount of capital consistent with the specific risks taken by a bank. In fact, Basel II is expected to create a whole range of positive spinoffs. Among others, it will help put in place a wider framework for supervision and regulation to be conducted on a consolidated basis. Supervision will become increasingly more risk focused and that, not with respect to Basel II implementation alone, but along with a re-focussing of other prudential rules as set out in the Basel Core Principles. Moreover, a system is expected to evolve out of Basel II that will enable intervention on the markets much before a crisis sets in because the whole framework is intended to avoid having to take action before any wide scale financial distress is at the doorstep. Care will also be taken to ensure that costs of regulation and supervision do not weigh down on the benefits of efficient private market operation in the implementation of the associated regulatory rules. All these will add value and, hopefully, lighten the overall burden of financial regulation while promoting overall financial stability at the same time. We have therefore to look into a framework of benefits and market efficiencies to be gained beyond ordinary Basel II considerations. Those benefits will emerge after Basel II becomes part of the reality and gives rise to a new thinking about what may be called a more even level playing field than what prevails cur rently at the national and international levels . It is for these reasons and to be really effective that the Bank of Mauritius has adopted, together with banks, a consultative and participative approach for Basel II implementation. The target date for implementation has tentatively been set for beginning 2008. Much work has been done already at the level of the Basel II Implementation Committee. Proposal drafts on work done have been circulated for views and comments from the industry as a prelude to progressive Basel II implementation in the form of guidelines issued to the industry. It is not intended to impose any specific Basel II approach but banks are being encouraged from the start to go for an approach – such as the Internal Ratings Based Approach – by which they will effectively add value now and in the longer term to the inherent capabilities of their institutions. All this is being done without losing sight of the investments banks are making or have already made to progress towards that goal by first adopting the simpler approaches of Basel II. I hope I have given you a broad background in these introductory remarks to set the stage for the Seminar. I am confident that close cooperation by various stakeholders and specialized resource persons including creditors, regulators, risk management strategists, financial analysts and credit risk modelers, will go a long way to make for the efficient and productive implementation of Basel II in Mauritius. To that end, this Seminar represents an important contribution and I take the opportunity to praise KPMG once again for taking the initiative. I thank you for your attention. 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
Christian Noyer: Recent developments and policy challenges affecting large-value and retail payment systems in Europe Speech by Mr Christian Noyer, Governor of the Bank of France, at the high-level international conference on “Central Banks in the 21st Century”, hosted by the Bank of Spain, Madrid, 8-9 June 2006.  *   *   * It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Madrid to share with you some thoughts about recent developments and policy challenges affecting payment systems in Europe.  Indeed structural changes are underway in Europe that should have a significant and positive bearing on the efficiency and safety of the payment infrastructures, notably in the wake of the implementation of the TARGET2 and the SEPA projects. Both projects are part of the overall process of the Lisbon agenda which aims at making the European Union “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-driven economy by 2010”. However, for Europe to reach that objective in the field of payment systems, a number of collective challenges have to be addressed, both by private actors and public authorities. Those challenges range from the redefinition by private actors of the boundaries between cooperation and competition, to the adjustment by public authorities of the legal and regulatory environment in which payment systems operate. In that context, the Eurosystem’s central banks have a key role to play, given their statutory task of promoting the smooth functioning of payment systems in euro. I will first review the key issues we are facing in Europe in the field of payment infrastructures. Then, I will discuss the current and possible future roles that the Eurosystem’s central banks can play in that field. 1. Key issues in the field of payment infrastructures today The three main issues I see as regards payment infrastructures today in Europe could be summarised as follows : (1) which role for payment infrastructures to support the European financial integration? (2) Which place to give to technological progress in the field of payment systems? (3) How to ensure business continuity of payment systems? 1.1.  Supporting the European financial integration The share of payment systems in money transfers between financial intermediaries is nearly 80%, versus 20% for the traditional correspondent banking arrangements. So, payment systems are essential for the financial sector as a whole and, therefore, can be considered as a key enabler in the process of the European financial integration. Such contribution of payment systems to the financial integration is embodied in the TARGET2 and SEPA projects. Both projects aim at the harmonisation and consolidation of the European “network” of payment infrastructures. While large-value payment systems have already attained a high level of integration and will further progress with the launch of TARGET2, retail payment systems are still very fragmented. In the segment of large-value payment systems, the degree of integration has increased very quickly. The rationale for setting up the two European-wide payment systems that currently exist, i.e. TARGET and EURO 1, was clearly to face the challenge of the EMU. TARGET2, which is due to go live at the end of 2007, will further improve the degree of integration of wholesale payment infrastructures and will represent a major step forward in their consolidation. It will provide to its users fully harmonised settlement services and prices across Europe, supported by a single shared platform. An important issue which is now under consideration is how TARGET2, as “backbone” of the euro market infrastructure of the euro, can best contribute to the integration and consolidation of the securities settlement systems with which it is going to interact. Should TARGET2, as announced by the Eurosystem and implemented in the system’s specifications, support a wide range of interaction BIS Review 53/2006 1 
modes in order to foster competition between systems and let market forces select the most efficient one (i.e. the so-called no prohibition no compulsion principle) ? Or should TARGET2 influence that selection process by limiting the interaction modes to only one in a long-term perspective? It goes without saying that in the latter case the Eurosystem, given its statutory responsibilities, can only select the most efficient interaction model, namely a model of settlement of cash and securities, which is in real time as it is the case in the US for instance, and which is integrated in a single platform. In the segment of retail payment systems, the situation is quite different. Retail infrastructures are still separated by national borders and characterized by a high degree of diversity. A number of local payment systems concentrate the clearing and settlement of all retail national transactions. In addition, the execution of cross-border payments go through several dedicated arrangements such as international card schemes, banking “clubs” or the EBA’s STEP 2 system. The SEPA project aims to put an end to such fragmentation by introducing, as from 2008, European payment instruments which are going to replace national ones by end-2010. The vision is that by end-2010 all retail payments in euro are carried out as easily, efficiently and safely across Europe as within national borders. For this vision to become a reality, a key enabler is that retail payment infrastructures become interoperable and consolidate. The outcome of theses changes on retail payment systems is uncertain. It may lead to various structures, ranging from a natural monopoly exercised by one infrastructure that would encompass most national and cross-border payment flows, to the competition between several systems. However, whatever the structure, the challenge will be to find the right balance between two objectives: (1) reaping economies of scale and scope and (2) fostering competitive market conditions and behaviours. 1.2. Keeping pace with technological progress The second issue for payment infrastructures consists in keeping pace with technological progress. Payment systems are made up of IT networks, hardware and software. As a consequence, technological progress is a key driver for enhancing the way payment systems are designed, operated and used. I will highlight a few significant examples of recent technological developments. The first half of the nineties experienced a major transformation in the design of large-value payment systems with the widespread introduction of real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. In a second step, further advances in information technologies have made possible new designs like the so called “hybrid systems”, i.e. systems that settle in real-time but, at the same time, minimise liquidity needs thanks to highly sophisticated optimisation mechanisms. In short, advances in information technology allowed large-value payment systems to settle faster, with a lower amount of liquidity and at a lower cost. On the retail payments side, technological progress should also allow safety and efficiency gains beyond those which have resulted, for instance, from the implementation of cheque truncation or those that are expected from introduction of the EMV (Europay Mastercard Visa) technology for card payments. Innovation has definitely an important role to play in order to keep the SEPA project future-oriented and promote the use of new delivery channels for retail payments like the internet and mobile devices, or new types of services like electronic invoicing. However, this flow of innovations come together with the entry in the payments market of new actors which do not always offer the same level of security as the traditional suppliers of those services, namely credit institutions. There is obviously a trade-off between, on the one hand, encouraging innovation by facilitating access to the payments market and, on the other hand, ensuring the safety of payments provided by setting prudential requirements on their suppliers. This challenge is at the heart of the current discussions on the “proposal for a directive on payment services in the internal market”. 1.3. Ensuring business continuity The third key issue I see is related to business continuity. Business continuity can be defined as a set of measures aimed at ensuring the continuity of service in various incident scenarios such as the failure of an infrastructure component, or the unavailability of the staff in charge of operating systems. Business continuity has progressively emerged as a key issue to be considered for the design of payment infrastructures. In addition, several factors have recently led to overhaul our approach of 2 BIS Review 53/2006 
operational risk: the spreading of real-time processing within payment systems, the growing complexity of technologies, the increasing interdependence between payment systems and the materialisation of risks such as terrorism or power breakdowns. All stakeholders - public authorities in charge of regulation and oversight, operators and users of infrastructures – have identified weaknesses as regards current practices. For example, incident scenarios impacting wide geographic areas have been overlooked. In Europe, there is a broad consensus on the need to strengthen business continuity requirements. The ultimate objective is clear: business continuity should contribute to enhance the soundness of the financial system as a whole. But it is not obvious to renew business continuity procedures. Among the challenges to be taken up, I see two major ones: (1) how far to go without putting at stake the cost efficiency of the systems? (2) How to ensure the necessary coherence of the efforts undertaken by stakeholders of different importance, submitted to different types of regulations, across the different financial centres that compose the financial system of the euro? 2. What roles for the Eurosystem The Eurosystem has been quite active in the field of payment systems and is likely to develop further its involvement under its three roles of: (1) service provider, (2) facilitator of market and regulatory evolution, and (3) overseer. 2.1. Providing payment services As a service provider, the Eurosystem has put priority on enhancing the efficiency and safety of its TARGET system, with the launch of the TARGET2 project. TARGET2 will provide harmonised services and prices, efficient liquidity management and settlement mechanisms, while setting a new benchmark in terms of business continuity. The Eurosystems objective is to promote the use of real-time settlement services in central bank money, given their expected social benefits in terms of risk reduction in the payment process. In the field of retail payments, the degree of the Eurosystem’s central banks’ operational involvement varies across countries. Most central banks provide payment services to public institutions. Some central banks also offer processing facilities to commercial banks by participating in private retail payment systems and/or operating an own retail payment system. The completion of the SEPA project calls for a specific effort of those central banks that are significantly involved in retail payment operations. They should lead by example, notably by supplying the new European payment instruments to their clients and by ensuring that the retail payment system they operate complies with the interoperability principle enshrined in the SEPA project. 2.2.  Acting as a facilitator of market and regulatory evolutions Turning to the involvement of the Eurosystem in payment systems issues as a facilitator of market and regulatory evolutions, it is fair to say that this mode of action has been mainly used in the field of retail payments to support the SEPA project. The SEPA project was launched in 2002 by the European banking community under the aegis of the Eurosystem and the European Commission. The banking industry has taken on the responsibility of delivering the SEPA products, in particular the specifications of the new European instruments. The European Commission, which grants a great importance to the SEPA project in so far as the latter contributes to the achievement of the common market and the completion of the Lisbon agenda, has elaborated a legal framework for payment services in the European Union. It made public, in December 2005, a directive proposal that should be adopted at the European level before being transposed in national laws by 2008. Since 1999, the Eurosystem’s central banks have been actively promoting, at European and national levels, the establishment of a SEPA. They proposed a vision which is now shared by all stakeholders, contributed to a constructive review of the banking community’s deliverables and cooperated with the European Commission to address legal and regulatory impediments. While the design phase of the SEPA project is almost completed, the next challenge is to ensure that migration towards the SEPA is well-organised and delivered. Because the starting point in each BIS Review 53/2006 3 
country is different, migration plans to the SEPA will primarily have to be organised locally. This should naturally lead to a further involvement of the Eurosystem’s central banks at national level, at least to help co-ordinating the efforts of the wide range of stakeholders. For example, the Banque de France and the French banking federation have created a national committee dedicated to the implementation of the SEPA. This committee gathers representatives of banks, different categories of users – public administration, corporates, retail business and citizens – as well as members of the French Parliament. It is in charge of coordinating works relating to the migration towards the SEPA. Having held its first meeting in April 2006, the committee foresees to adopt the French migration plan by October. 2.3.  Overseeing payment systems As overseers, the central banks of the Eurosystem have also contributed to the objectives of European financial integration, technological progress and higher resilience of the financial system. So far, this contribution has consisted in developing and applying an oversight framework for retail payment systems, which contributes to establish safety and efficiency guidelines for the expected integration and consolidation of retail payment systems in the context of the SEPA project. The need that the payment systems’ regulatory framework keeps pace with the structural changes underway in Europe is likely to lead the Eurosystem’s central banks to develop further their involvement as overseers, at least in two directions. The first direction is the updating of the existing oversight requirements to new market realities. Work has already started in that respect. For instance, the Eurosystem is currently revising the oversight standard for systemically important payment systems relating to operational risk. This is because discussions and initiatives in order to strengthen business continuity management have taken place mostly at national level and have not systematically considered that the financial system of the euro operates as a euro area-wide network of interrelated markets, market infrastructures and participants. Therefore, the Eurosystem is preparing a revised version of its business continuity expectations for systemically important payment systems that should be integrated soon into its oversight policy framework. The transformation of the payment infrastructures landscape in Europe should also logically lead to an updating of the oversight framework for retail payment systems. In particular, retail payment systems are about to become interoperable and face a consolidation process, which is likely to lead to the establishment of links between systems. Such links may potentially imply a spill over of risks from one system to another. Central banks will have to make their oversight function evolve accordingly. Oversight standards will certainly have to include the links between systems, as it is already the case for securities settlement systems. The second direction for an evolution of the oversight activities of the Eurosystem is the extension of the scope of its oversight framework to the European payment instruments currently in the making and their associated clearing and settlement systems. Investigations are currently underway to elaborate an oversight framework for card payments. Concluding remarks Payment systems, which are significant contributors to the broader effectiveness and stability of the financial system, are currently exposed in Europe to specific structural changes notably as a result of pressures and progress towards financial integration in the euro area. Integration and consolidation of payment systems have made progress, while remaining in line with expectations in terms of safety. However, further progress need to be made, notably in the field of retail payment services and infrastructures. In that perspective, the Eurosystem’s central banks will continue to significantly contribute to these evolutions, but I believe that market forces should be and are likely to be the primary engine for such progress.  4 BIS Review 53/2006 
Toshihiko Fukui: Recent economic and financial developments and the conduct of monetary policy  Summary of a speech by Mr Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan National Press Club, Tokyo, 20 June 2006.  *      *      * Introduction Japan's economy continues to grow, with domestic and external demand and also the corporate and household sectors well in balance. The economy is likely to achieve sustainable growth under price stability. Today, I will explain the background of the economic outlook and assess several risk factors influencing the outlook. Moreover, based on the review, I will talk about how the Bank will conduct monetary policy with a view to achieving sustainable growth under price stability. I. Outlook for economic activity and prices I will first summarize the outlook for economic activity and prices. The Bank presented the projection of economic activity and prices for two years ahead through fiscal 2007 in its Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report) released on April 28, 2006: Japan's economy is likely to experience a sustained period of expansion, with domestic and external demand and also the corporate and household sectors well in balance, and the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI; excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) is likely to rise gradually. The Outlook Report pointed to the following four factors as the mechanism behind the projection. First, exports are likely to continue to increase reflecting global economic expansion. Second, corporate performance is likely to continue to be strong. Third, the positive influence of corporate sector strength on the household sector is likely to become stronger. And fourth, financial conditions are likely to remain extremely accommodative. Examining data available after the publication of the Outlook Report, developments in economic activity and prices so far seem to be in line with the projection in the Outlook Report. As for economic activity in fiscal 2005, which is the basis of the projection for fiscal 2006 and 2007, it was confirmed that the economy had continued to grow with balanced external demand and domestic demand particularly in the private sector. Real GDP registered an annualized growth rate of 3.1 percent for the January-March quarter of 2006 and 3.2 percent for fiscal 2005. Corporate performance continued to be strong, as is evident from increases in profits both in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors at the book closing for fiscal 2005, following the large gains in the previous fiscal year. In this situation, business fixed investment both in the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors showed robust growth during the January-March quarter of 2006, as shown in the quarterly Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry. As for future developments in economic activity, the corporate sector is likely to remain strong. Major firms are expected to enjoy continued profit growth in fiscal 2006, which in the manufacturing sector is likely to be particularly strong in the processing industries, such as electrical machinery, general machinery, and automobiles, and in the nonmanufacturing sector in industries related to private consumption, such as retailing and services. Various surveys indicate that firms' business fixed investment plans are also relatively strong. We expect that the strength in the corporate sector will continue, but the growth in business fixed investment will gradually slow. I will elaborate on this later. The positive influence of the strength in the corporate sector on the household sector is becoming more evident. As for employment and wages, labor market conditions have been improving on the whole. The unemployment rate has recently declined to around 4 percent from the 5-6 percent level in 2003, and the ratio of job offers to applicants has been exceeding 1.00 for the first time since 1992. In addition to the increase in the number of part-time workers, the number of full-time workers has been increasing recently due to the shortage of labor felt among firms. As for wages, regular payments have started to rise in addition to the increases in overtime and bonus payments. Although the pace of increase in wages is moderate partly due to firms' efforts to restrain labor costs, the increase is likely BIS Review 59/2006 1 
to continue. With the increase not only in temporary income but also in the more permanent part of income, private consumption is likely to remain strong. Turning to prices, domestic corporate goods prices are rising, due to the surge in the prices of international commodities such as crude oil and nonferrous metals. Recently released statistics show that the year-on-year rate of increase in domestic corporate goods prices was 3.3 percent in May, faster than the 2.5 percent increase in April. It is likely to remain high for the time being. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI was 0.5 percent in April and continued to be on an uptrend. Looking at individual prices for items in the CPI basket, the number of items showing price rises is gradually increasing, and the trend toward price increases is becoming more robust. For example, prices for services, such as those for package tours, golf fees, and educational costs, have been revised upward with the start of the new fiscal year. Services prices are important indicators to confirm the general trend in prices, because their movements are largely influenced by changes in wages. Prices of items other than services, such as personal effects and clothing, are also increasing gradually. II.  Developments in overseas economies As I explained, Japan's economy is likely to achieve sustainable growth under price stability. Domestic private demand seems to be standing on a firm foundation given that structural adjustment pressures in the corporate sector and the financial system have dissipated. This directs our attention to developments in overseas economies as one major risk factor determining the outlook for Japan's economy. In the U.S. economy, business fixed investment and production have been increasing steadily, but signs of deceleration in housing construction have finally been observed and the pace of increase in household spending and employment has been slowing. This trend suggests that interest rate raises by the Federal Reserve to date have been gradually taking effect. The increase in the core CPI has been accelerating slightly, reflecting the rise in utilization of labor and production capacity in addition to high crude oil prices. In this situation, inflationary concerns seem to be mounting. As for developments in the near future, important issues are whether economic deceleration in the United States will result in a soft landing, and whether inflationary concerns will be contained. In Europe, the momentum for economic recovery has been increasing gradually, as is evident from increases in exports and production and the recovery in household spending. Under these circumstances, the European Central Bank has been carefully raising its policy interest rate since 2005 in order to stave off the upward pressure on general prices from high crude oil prices and to sustain the economic expansion. The Chinese economy has continued to show extremely high growth. Monetary policy has been tightened recently so as to deal with the expansion in the money stock and bank lending as well as high growth in business fixed investment. Whether overheating of economic activity can be contained through appropriate policy conduct is an important factor when monitoring developments not only in the Chinese economy but also the world economy, and global price developments including developments in international commodity prices. In 2005, the world economy grew by nearly 5 percent. This expansion has been supported by the fact that a stable financial environment has been maintained by containing upward pressure on prices. A key factor in maintaining a stable financial environment is whether global inflationary concerns continue to be contained in the future. III. Developments in financial markets I would next like to briefly touch on recent developments in global financial markets. Stock prices have been declining in emerging economies as well as in major industrial countries. Financial markets in many emerging economies have been weak, as is evident from the falls in bond prices and foreign exchange rates in addition to stock prices. Prices of some international commodities, including those of nonferrous metals, have declined recently, after exhibiting large increases. Market participants point to various factors behind these developments. One is the adjustment of stock and commodity prices, which had risen substantially in the prolonged accommodative financial environment around the world, in response to changes in the degree of this financial accommodation. 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
Another factor is uncertainty as to whether inflationary risks will be contained, and whether a considerable deceleration of economic activity will be staved off even when inflationary risks are contained. The fundamentals of economies worldwide, including Japan's, do not seem to have changed significantly so far. Under the current economic circumstances, financial markets are evolving in pursuit of a new equilibrium by digesting new information while interacting with each other. Financial market developments continue to warrant careful monitoring, since they influence economic activity through their impact on business and household sentiment. IV. Developments in inventory investment As I mentioned earlier, domestic private demand is standing on a firm foundation, but in the corporate sector, it is necessary to pay attention to the possibility of a stock adjustment. Such adjustment involves both downside and upside risks to the outlook for economic activity in the short term: inventory adjustment, for example in IT-related sectors, is a downside risk while a further acceleration of business fixed investment is an upside risk. Given that the output gap has already closed, a further acceleration of business fixed investment should be regarded not only as an upside risk in the short term but also a factor leading to larger economic swings in the longer term as a result of a subsequent downturn. Looking first at inventory investment, levels of inventories are still relatively low. The inventory cycle in the manufacturing sector as a whole suggests that the growth in shipments and inventories is more or less in balance. Focusing on individual industries, excess inventories, particularly of general-purpose products, had built up in the iron and steel, and chemical industries, but recently, adjustments in these industries have been coming to an end. In IT-related sectors, the level of inventories has been somewhat high, but this is basically in line with the increase in shipments, and thus unintended and excessive inventories have not been built up at the moment. There are some factors, however, that may trigger inventory adjustments. For example, although the demand for IT-related goods is expected to continue increasing, there is a possibility of inventory adjustments for such goods occurring depending on developments in demand. This is because the supply of these goods is increasing at a rapid pace, including in the high-value-added products sector where Japanese firms have a competitive edge. V. Developments in business fixed investment As mentioned earlier, a further acceleration in business fixed investment, as another possible avenue of stock adjustments, entails not only an upside risk in the short term but also a factor leading to larger economic swings in the longer term as a result of a subsequent downturn.  From a business-cycle point of view, the economic recovery appears to be reaching the mature stage and growth is projected to gradually decelerate to the potential growth rate. Although corporate performance is likely to remain strong, the growth in business fixed investment is expected to slow as the level of capital stock becomes higher with the accumulation of past investment. As a result, the driving force of economic activity will shift gradually from the corporate sector to the household sector. The deceleration in business fixed investment is expected to stave off a build-up of capital stock and contribute to achieving a sustained period of growth. Especially given that the output gap has closed, excessive investment and stronger economic growth are likely to increase the risk of an eventual swingback. So far, no signs of excessive investment have been observed. In the face of intense global competition, firms seem to be selective in allocating their business resources. It is true, however, that the financial environment is extremely accommodative and gives incentives to firms to accelerate business fixed investment. Real short-term interest rates in Japan are currently negative and extremely low compared with real GDP growth currently exceeding 3 percent and an estimated growth rate of the potential output ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 percent. Moreover, the functioning of the financial system has been enhanced and private financial institutions have been maintaining a proactive lending posture. The year-on-year growth in lending by private banks turned positive in the summer of 2005 and has been on a gradual upward trend since. BIS Review 59/2006 3 
VI. Conduct of monetary policy in a low-inflation environment Turning to a slightly theoretical issue, until recently, the main difficulty in conducting monetary policy in a low-inflation environment has been focused on how to deal with the risk of a deflationary spiral. In a low-inflation environment, nominal interest rates are typically low and are thus more probable to be constrained by the zero bound. Because nominal interest rates cannot be lowered below zero, real interest rates are likely to become higher than the optimal level for the economy when prices fall. That increases the risk of the economy falling into a vicious cycle of declining prices and deteriorating economic activity. In Japan, such a risk has been a matter of strong concern since the end of the 1990s. At present, this risk has become low, since the Japanese financial system has restored its stability and firms have now resolved excesses in production capacity, employment, and debt. On the other hand, when economic activity is picking up as a result of an unprecedented monetary easing against severe economic conditions with low inflation, a central bank is required to carry out monetary policy adroitly to adjust monetary accommodation by assessing upside risks. For example, since the inflation rate tends to exhibit strong inertia, even if the supply-demand conditions in the economy become tighter, the observed rate of inflation and inflation expectations are likely to remain anchored at a low level. In such a situation, maintaining an excessively accommodative monetary condition entails a risk of causing temporary overheating of the economy and a subsequent downturn, thereby resulting in larger swings in economic activity. The sensitivity of the rate of inflation to changes in the output gap has tended to become weaker not only in Japan but also abroad in recent years, reflecting structural changes such as deregulation, advances in information and telecommunication technology, and the deepening of economic globalization. Since prices are becoming less sensitive in the short term, central banks are required to take appropriate measures by examining medium- to long-term risks to the economy. This suggests the need to take a forward-looking approach in the conduct of monetary policy. VII. A stable economic and price environment A stable economic and price environment, once achieved by the appropriate conduct of monetary policy with a view to medium- to long-term risks, allows firms and households to make decisions more smoothly. As a result, the allocation of resources in the economy as a whole will be more efficient, and not only will short-term economic fluctuations be reduced but also the medium- to long-term growth path will be pushed up. Looking back at real GDP trends in Japan and the United States over the past 25 years or so, we see that economies often achieve higher growth when they move in a less volatile manner. As a result of smooth economic adjustments in the early 1980s after the Second Oil Crisis, Japan's economy followed a higher trend growth path than the U.S. economy while it moved in a less volatile manner thereafter. This situation, however, was reversed after the bursting of the asset price bubble in the early 1990s, and Japan's economy experienced a decline in the trend growth path while moving in a volatile manner. Japan's economy is now emerging from the prolonged stagnation that was an aftermath of the bursting of the asset price bubble, and is heading toward a sustainable growth path under price stability. In order to ensure this development, it is important, through the appropriate conduct of monetary policy, to minimize the volatility of business cycles and maintain a stable economic environment. VIII. Conduct of monetary policy Before concluding my speech today, I will talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy based on the assessment of economic activity and prices mentioned so far. The Bank has been reducing the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank by paying due attention to the stability of the money market under the guideline for money market operations that encourages the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent. Through this process, the uncollateralized overnight call rate has been stable at around zero percent, despite small temporary increases. In the call market, interest rates have shown some fluctuations reflecting market conditions and the volume of transactions has been gradually increasing. Under these circumstances, 4 BIS Review 59/2006 
the Bank no longer finds it difficult to control the uncollateralized overnight call rate in its day-to-day operations. In this sense, the reduction of the outstanding balance of current accounts has virtually been completed. With regard to the future course of monetary policy, the Bank will conduct monetary policy in line with the thinking described in the Outlook Report as long as developments in economic activity and prices follow the Bank's projection presented also in the Outlook Report. In other words, it seems probable that the accommodative financial conditions ensuing from very low interest rates will be maintained for some time following a period in which the uncollateralized overnight call rate is at effectively zero percent. Through and beyond this stage, the Bank will adjust the level of interest rates gradually in the light of developments in economic activity and prices. The timing of a policy change depends on developments in economic activity and prices from this time on, and there is no predetermined view regarding the future path of monetary policy at this point. The projection in the Outlook Report, which appears to be the desirable course of the economy, that is, sustainable growth under price stability, is based on the assumption that market participants and firms have been factoring in future policy changes to some extent when making their decisions. If the economy develops in line with the projection, changing the policy interest rate in the light of developments in economic activity and prices will stave off an excess of economic activity, minimize the volatility of business cycles, and lead the economy onto a sustainable growth path. The projection suggests that economic activity is likely to slow and prices are expected to follow a moderate uptrend. Consequently, the Bank will not have to drastically adjust the policy interest rate, but, as mentioned earlier, will be able to adjust interest rates "gradually." Of course, there is the time lag before a monetary policy action influences economic activity and prices, and it is therefore necessary to not only take the current economic and price situation into account but also look ahead to future developments. In addition, in assessing developments in economic activity and prices, it is important to pay close attention to a variety of indicators and other relevant information in order to carefully judge overall conditions of economic activity and prices rather than concentrate on just one particular indicator, such as the CPI during the period of quantitative easing. Conclusion In sum, Japan's economy continues to grow, with domestic and external demand and also the corporate and household sectors well in balance. The Bank is determined to contribute to leading Japan's economy to sustainable growth under price stability, through the appropriate conduct of monetary policy. BIS Review 59/2006 5 
Nicholas C Garganas: Regional financial stability around the Eurozone Presentation by Mr Nicholas C Garganas, Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the conference on Regional Financial Stability Around the Eurozone, organised by the Euro 50 Group, Istanbul, 1 June 2006. *      *      * I am delighted to have been asked to participate in this conference on “Regional Financial Stability Around the Eurozone”. This topic has gained importance as the economies - and particularly the financial systems - of South-Eastern European (SEE) countries have increasingly developed linkages both within their region and with the Eurozone. In recent years, SEE countries have generally experienced high rates of economic growth, improvements in macroeconomic fundamentals, and a significant transformation and growth of their financial systems. For sustainable future growth and development in the region, the maintenance of financial stability is an essential precondition. In turn, the existence of an effective legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector and the conduct of financial supervision in accordance with international best practices plays an important role in promoting financial stability. To this end, considerable efforts have already been made to strengthen the legal and regulatory frameworks of the financial sector in SEE countries and to improve supervisory practice. In what follows, I will briefly discuss the various channels through which external assistance towards regulatory and supervisory reform in South-Eastern Europe has been provided, identify some areas where further reform and expertise appears necessary, and suggest some co-operative arrangements that could contribute to this objective.  Over the past fifteen years or so, technical assistance to improve the legal and regulatory framework of the financial sectors of SEE countries and the implementation and enforcement capabilities of the competent national authorities has been provided in various forms by international organisations such as the IMF, the World Bank,  and the BIS. Although a comprehensive discussion of all these projects is not realistic in my short presentation, it may be worthwhile to at least mention a few of them. Supervisory personnel from SEE countries have participated in training seminars offered by the Financial Stability Institute of the BIS and by the Joint Vienna Institute. Under the joint IMF-World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program, international teams of experts have assessed the financial sectors of SEE countries and the degree of compliance with Basel Core Principles and have identified weaknesses and proposed corrective measures, many of which have since been implemented by the countries concerned. In coordination with international institutions, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has supported projects in many SEE countries to improve the regulatory framework for the financial sector and the conduct of supervision. As SEE countries aspire to eventual EU membership, the European Commission has been particularly active in the region both in providing technical assistance and in monitoring progress in financial sector reform. As regards technical assistance, the European Commission’s main instrument is the Twinning Programs financed by the PHARE and CARDS facilities. Twinning Programs are particularly useful since each beneficiary country determines its specific needs and is subsequently able to choose the one that best meets its requirements among the proposals submitted. Twinning Programs also help to establish close working relationships between the authorities of recipient countries and those of the EU countries which provide technical assistance. The ECB has also provided technical assistance to SEE countries through various channels such as short-term missions, conferences and internships. ECB assistance was given in the fields of money and banking statistics, payment and settlement systems and financial stability as well as in other fields which fall outside the scope of my presentation. Moreover, the ECB, acting as co-ordinator of Eurosystem projects, is currently working on a number of projects in the region, including the finalisation of plans for a 6-month CARDS funded project to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Apart from these Commission and ECB initiatives, technical assistance has been provided to SEE countries on a bilateral basis by the financial sector authorities of individual EU countries, usually through less formal ad hoc arrangements focusing on specific areas where particular SEE countries require expertise. Finally, the Memoranda of Understanding concluded between the banking supervisory authorities of EU countries and those of the SEE countries provide for regular meetings to discuss supervisory principles and practices and, in some cases, include specific provisions for co-operation in staff training. In most SEE countries, the basic legal and regulatory framework for the financial sector is now in place and largely conforms with international standards. Nevertheless, there are differences between SEE countries as regards the state of development of financial sector regulation and supervision. Generally, there is a positive relationship between progress in these areas and how far each country BIS Review 59/2006 1 
has moved along the path leading to EU membership. As Bulgaria and Romania are acceding countries and Turkey, Croatia and FYROM are EU-candidate countries, they have generally made greater progress in adopting the acquis Communautaire in the financial sector compared to the remaining SEE countries, which are in various stages of the Stabilisation and Association Process. As a rule, in SEE countries the legal and regulatory framework and the implementation and enforcement capabilities of the supervisory authorities are more developed in the banking sector compared to other segments of the financial system. This is due to the fact that the capital markets are still underdeveloped in SEE countries, with the banking sector dominating the financial system in these countries. Accordingly, both the national authorities and the foreign providers of technical assistance place more emphasis on regulatory and supervisory reform in the banking sector. [Bulgaria and Romania have nevertheless made progress toward harmonization with EU regulations on capital markets.] Meanwhile, in all SEE countries except Turkey, foreign banks, mainly from EU countries, have acquired, through their subsidiaries and branch networks, a dominant position in local banking systems. This development has increased competition, facilitated the transfer of expertise especially in credit assessment and risk management and enhanced the ability of local banking systems to operate under more demanding supervisory standards. In contrast with the banking sector, the insurance sector in SEE countries is still underdeveloped and tends to be characterized by weak governance and regulation, despite improvements in recent years, mainly in Bulgaria and Romania in connection with these countries’  preparation for EU accession.  Furthermore,  reflecting the persisting problems in governance and regulation, the insurance sector in SEE countries tends to be undercapitalized. In the banking sectors of SEE counties, it appears that the degree of progress towards achieving international best standards has not been the same in all areas of regulatory and supervisory interest, particularly as regards the implementation and enforcement capabilities of the competent authorities. In a number of countries, assessments on behalf of the European Commission and the IMF have revealed remaining weaknesses in such fields as anti-money laundering, consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates, implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), integrated assessment of risk management systems and the extent of co-operation with foreign supervisors. [As regards the IFRS, it is worth noting that Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Serbia have already implemented these standards for companies and banks, while Turkey and Albania envisage their implementation by 2008.] Moreover, SEE countries face important medium-term challenges relating to the effective application of the principles of good corporate governance across the financial sector, the implementation of the Basel II capital adequacy framework and the development of a comprehensive methodology for financial stability assessment, including the design of a macro stress-testing framework, especially for credit risk. Although central banks in some SEE countries have already made progress in financial stability assessment, more work needs to be done and such assessments need to increasingly take into account potential repercussions from regional and wider European developments. The above considerations indicate areas where further assistance may be required by particular countries. Apart from programs supported by international organisations, continuing recourse to bilateral co-operation arrangements between authorities of EU countries and those of SEE countries would be particularly useful. In this respect, the experience of the authorities of EU countries that have relatively recently completed the reform of their financial sector in accordance with international standards would be a valuable input to the authorities of SEE countries that currently face similar challenges. Also, peer group reviews by financial sector supervisors from other countries could play a useful role in periodically assessing the effectiveness of financial sector regulation and supervision in each SEE country and in offering advice on needed improvements. Finally, national Banking Federations of SEE countries can help to bring the operation of local banks up to EU standards through multilateral co-operation in the areas of staff training and convergence in the implementation of sound operating and risk management systems. To this end, the national Banking Federations participating in the Interbalkan Banking Forum have recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding. It is important to recognize that, as the financial systems of SEE countries are liberalized and their economies become more open, the task of maintaining financial stability becomes more challenging. In meeting this challenge, I believe that arrangements for supervisory co-operation and the provision of technical assistance can continue to play a useful role in supporting national efforts for further regulatory and supervisory reform aimed at strengthening the resilience of the financial sector of SEE countries and achieving conformity with EU standards. 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
Let me conclude by stressing the importance of the financial system for economic growth. Why is the financial system so crucial? The answer is that the financial system can be thought of as a coordinating mechanism that allocates capital to building factories, houses and roads. If capital is misallocated, the economy will operate inefficiently and economic growth will be low (Mishkin, 2005)1. Effectively, just as a high level of human capital increases the productivity of labour, so an efficient financial system increases the productivity of all factor inputs. For this reason, a financial system can be thought of as the central nervous system of an economy. If it is stable and efficient, it coordinates the economy’s activities, helping to improve the living standards of its citizens  Thank you for your attention.                                                       1  Mishkin, S.

Marion Williams: Opportunities in the Caribbean Speech by Dr Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of Barbados, at the 6th Euromoney/Latinfinance Caribbean Investment Forum, Bridgetown, 10 May 2006. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, Minister of Tourism and International Transport, Mr. Noel Lynch, Members of the Diplomatic Corps, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen. As we observed yesterday, this conference serves as a useful forum for the exchange of ideas on the way forward for the Caribbean. This morning I will add a few ideas about how Corporate Caribbean can position itself, so as to distinguish itself from the pack in this the first decade of the 21st Century, as we cope with the myriad changes occurring all around us. My presentation will deal with internationalization generally; but it will have a special emphasis on services and on the financial sector in particular. One thing is clear; it is important for the regional corporate sector to integrate itself into the international environment. Corporations sometimes balk at the idea of foreign ownership which they see as the main vehicle for internationalization. However, this is only one form of integration into the international environment.  Because so many of our companies are small in a global sense, it will be important for them to be more nimble and innovative in constructing new relationships, building smart partnerships with companies in other jurisdictions and seeking ways to obtain synergies from their operations jointly with those of others are options. Use of common services where this is feasible and shared platforms where possible are other possibilities. We must also be able to respond to change rapidly. This means restructuring where necessary, taking decisions to revamp our operations to international standards, using the technology available more effectively, and commercializing our official development assistance institutions.  The active involvement of financial service providers, both in the private sector and the public sector will be important; for when corporate change at the individual company level takes place in the context of supportive changes in the general business environment then it is more likely to gain momentum.  Globalization and balance of payments stability Inevitably, financial liberalization, taken to its logical conclusion, will require that capital mobility be accelerated, though, at a pace consistent with manageable levels of financial volatility and consistent with domestic monetary stability. The macroeconomic and monetary environment have therefore to be as supportive as possible also, but most importantly, that environment must be as stable as possible. Liberalization must therefore be balanced against stability. The latter being the more important.  Many Caribbean economies have identified services as a key sector which offers faster prospects of internationalization. Caribbean economies have realized that they can accelerate development of their services sector even before the manufacturing sector matures. This is certainly the case with some international financial centres (usually termed “offshore centres”) whose manufacturing sectors had not yet reached the levels of sophistication of many developed countries, but whose services sectors have grown exponentially. Barbados, Bahamas, Bermuda and Cayman are well-known examples.  Support services are very critical to the development of the services sector in the Caribbean. Business services, telecommunications, information technology and computer based services influence the ability of many service economies to deliver cross border services and are critical to the building of a vibrant international services sector. We are happy to say that the Caribbean is beginning to benefit from the liberalization of the telecommunications sector and the results are already obvious in terms of lower operational costs of business. We have also observed that in the current global environment, there is a clear shift away from physical product-based wealth accumulation to knowledge-based wealth accumulation. Professionals with the flexibility to adapt to the changing environment can provide the catalyst needed to propel the Caribbean to higher sustainable growth paths. At the same time, growth of our services sector has the potential for greater employment because of the labour-intensive nature of service activities and offers BIS Review 59/2006 1 
the possibility for small-scale operations to expand rapidly by drawing on the potential linkages with the other sectors of the economy and with the rest of the world. Electronic commerce is also providing opportunities for Caribbean companies, since it does not recognize size as a constraint. It allows service providers in the region to offer services in foreign jurisdictions with greater ease, though admittedly, it also permits foreign professionals to offer services in the region as well. This means that local providers have to step up their game, since technology has already outpaced the ability to protect domestic service providers and is forcing the internationalization of service markets. In fact, services are becoming the most traded item on the Internet. This mode of service delivery while giving developing countries like the Caribbean an advantage, will not be a give away since it does not take the competition away.  Because of the traditional perception that developed countries do it better, the quality of services provided by the Caribbean will need to be superior to that provided by develop country operators. This will require a massive investment in education and training by our universities, colleges and corporations, since many professional services allow for provision without a presence there are possibilities for expansion in overseas markets at low costs. No longer can the financial service provider consider himself competent if he is not maximizing the use of the modern technologies and techniques. Clients have computerized their systems, many will be using the Internet to conduct commerce, and others will be utilizing electronic transmission, more sophisticated methods and other forms not yet invented. Already the traditional approach to understanding the clients’ business, validating it, advising on it, recommending changes to control systems and system improvements, will require that the financial service provider has a sound understanding of these technologies, which, in most cases must be superior to that of his client. The financial service provider in the Caribbean must keep himself and his firm in the forefront of technological development irrespective of his location. In the globalized world, financial service providers will be required to deal with new owners, with different cultural norms, different organizational structures, differing levels of efficiency, speed, productivity, and standards of transparency. Flexibility will therefore be important. Identifying and evaluating a wider range of risks in a globalized environment Greater internationalization will also mean greater attention to risk management and the need for a keen appreciation of different types of risk including: including principally country risk, interest rate risk, exchange rate risks and systems risk and, increasingly, operational risk. This applies not only because domestic companies are forming alliances with foreign companies, but also because domestic companies themselves are conducting significantly more business in other currencies and in other countries. There will be increasing need for the profession to track the international financial markets, to monitor potential changes in those factors which can impact on corporate effectiveness, profitability and survival. They must be equipped to evaluate the risks which lie behind complex financial instruments and be able to use them effectively. There are clear signs that this is beginning to happen in Barbados. Greater in-depth knowledge of tax systems of other domiciles Increased cross-border activity will also require greater and more in depth knowledge of tax systems in other domiciles, and tax experts are likely to become highly sought after professionals both by companies as well as high net worth individuals. If the professionals are located in the Caribbean, then there is greater likelihood that such businesses will be attracted to the region. Tax and legal guidelines on conducting trade in cyberspace What is clear is that internationalization is moving us toward global rules and global systems and financial compliance rules are becoming international. The signs are that it will be a continuing and accelerating process, and adjustment times will need to become increasingly shorter if we are to stay in the game. The divide between financial type activities is already becoming less distinct and non-banks are encroaching on the areas traditionally provided only by banks. These changes can achieve synergies 2 BIS Review 59/2006 
and can make the new institutions potentially more cost efficient. They can also help to afford a wider global reach and generate a greater flow of information that may benefit financial markets as a whole, but it will be important that we develop an orderly and level playing field for such expansion so as to avoid regulatory arbitrage and the possibility of some categories of companies being treated differently from others. Productivity Emphasis on productivity is vital in the current global economic landscape. High levels of productivity cannot by themselves solve problems of competitiveness but they certainly increase all countries’ ability to cope with some of the challenges. Inroads being made into the viability of small service-producing countries can be partly counterbalanced by higher levels of efficiency and productivity which enhance their competitiveness and by quality improvements in service delivery so that we do not have to rely as heavily on tax concessions since there have been subject to challenges.  Transparency will be essential for international transactions to thrive. It has the potential to create a greater degree of certainty in the market, making it more likely for investors to commit themselves to continued investment, particular in distance and unfamiliar locations.  Disclosure can be too excessive There will be occasions however, when it is necessary to withhold some information on policy initiatives. Where markets learn ahead of time of planned initiatives, they can, by their actions, undermine the intended outcomes. The general tendency towards disclosure should however be encouraged, though the use of discretion will still be required from time to time.  New Basel Accord and new measurement of risks International regulators have identified a need to upgrade the regulatory framework governing commercial banks and have produced new guidelines referred to as Basel II. This will place additional pressure on Caribbean banks to enhance their skill sets and to put new systems in place. The new provisions will be one more challenge for the region, but because many of us are home to international banks, we will be propelled into adapting Basel II sooner rather than later. Again, despite assurances that we don’t need to comply, we will be forced to prove that we are in the game or we will most certainly be treated like second cousins. Globalization and rating agencies and risk assessment The role of rating agencies will be given a fillip as a result of the new guidelines. Ratings give greater knowledge and confidence to investors, particularly to investors unfamiliar with the jurisdiction or with companies in the jurisdiction and it should facilitate the internationalization of financial transactions. In many instances institutions that are not currently rated will need, due to their relatively small size, to seek to have themselves rated. Though this is an added cost of integration into the international financial landscape, the Caribbean must position itself to remain relevant in this new environment and will have little option or we run the risk of losing investment or of having to raise funds at higher costs if unrated. Our new regional credit rating agency is well-positioned to provide some of these services. Globalized payment systems Electronic payment systems, the increasing size of transactions, and the fragility of some corporates, have prompted payment systems to enhance their methods of operation with a view to improving security of large-value transactions. Banks in the Caribbean are a part of such enhancements as they seek to participate on competitive terms in large transactions involving transnational corporations.  BIS Review 59/2006 3 
Securities At the same time, emphasis is being placed on the development of paperless cross-border trading systems and on systems which enhance the security and finality of transactions. In addition, greater efforts are being made to ensure compatibility of systems in order to more efficiently facilitate cross-trading of securities on a regional basis. Prospects for growth in the international financial services sector of developing countries A quick evaluation of the future of the international financial sector, more familiarly termed the offshore sector, shows that, as high net worth companies and individuals grow in wealth and seek vehicles for tax planning to reduce their tax liabilities, the international financial services sector worldwide will grow despite efforts to prevent it. The power of large corporations will almost certainly ensure that these services continue.  As long as the skills development which is taking place in the international financial services sector continues, this sector will flourish. There is already an increase in the number of fund managers who can engage in securities management at a sophisticated level. Professional organizations in the Caribbean are therefore encouraged to continue to bring these skills on board. Employment prospects in the international financial sector Instant information on account updates, intra-day positioning by banks and multi-currency portfolio packages are now possible through the use of specially developed software and hardware. This has redefined the types of skills which are needed in banks and other financial institutions. The restructuring of the sector in the last few years has tended to emphasize the importance of skills renewal. Familiarity with multi-currency funds management, and skills in managing a wider range of instruments will be increasingly necessary and greater predictive capability about movements in overseas markets will be required. These are some of the challenges and opportunities I see facing the services sector and especially the financial corporate sector as it attempts to grow. This first decade of the 21st century promises therefore to be an exciting one for the Caribbean provided if we are willing to grasp the many opportunities presented and provided we are not side tracked from our goal of keeping up with the front runners. We cannot afford to fall behind. I trust that over the rest of this conference our deliberations will help to confirm our resolve. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 59/2006 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Paris Club Speech by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Paris Club, Paris, 14 June 2006. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to be here in Paris on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Paris Club. This is not only because the Paris Club is an important forum that has made a major contribution in the area of orderly debt restructuring, but also because I have of course a lot of personal memories of the long time – from 1982 until 1993 – that I spent actively participating in its activities, together with a lot of close friends from all over the world. The Paris Club, which is responsible for the rescheduling of official bilateral credits to developing and emerging market economies, has played a remarkable role as a forum for crisis management and resolution. Embedded in the international financial system, the Paris Club has responded to the changing international financial landscape and the various financial crises over the last few decades by systematically adapting its modus operandi to the varying needs of the different groups of indebted countries. In particular, once it was recognised that traditional mechanisms were not sufficient to attain sustainable external debt levels, the Paris Club introduced increasingly concessional debt restructuring terms and, as of the late 1980s, debt reduction mechanisms as well to address the rising debt burdens of certain countries. During that time, the Paris Club reached its peak level of activity. More recently, the number of countries rescheduling with Paris Club creditors has been declining, reflecting enhanced access by middle-income countries to market financing and more comprehensive debt stock treatment of low income countries. Since its first debt rescheduling meeting in 1956, the Paris Club has been highly effective and has reached some 400 agreements with 81 debtor countries, covering a total of USD 523 billion in nominal value. The success of the Paris Club is understandable and, considering that these accomplishments were attained by what we could term a “non-institution” (there was no international treaty or written charter to set up the Paris Club), may therefore appear to be a paradox at first sight.  The operations of the Paris Club over the last five decades reflect both the way in which developing and emerging market economies have benefited from economic and financial globalisation and the challenges that they have been faced with during this process. Let me be more specific on the substantial benefits of economic and financial globalisation and the inevitable challenges that this poses to policy-makers and market participants. Among the benefits of globalisation, I would mention one which appears particularly relevant for the activities of the Paris Club. Emerging countries are becoming more and more integrated into the world economy. They are increasingly involved in the exchange of goods and capital, and can benefit from the transfer of know-how and technologies. The scrutiny by international investors enhances the quality of their economic policy, thus contributing to better fundamentals. In most recent years, several emerging countries have been providing the rest of the world with net resources in the form of current account surpluses – a trend that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago in the midst of the Asian crisis. Given these developments, an increasing number of emerging countries have significantly decreased their external debt or have even turned into net creditors vis-à-vis the rest of the world. That said, economic success does not come without risks. Globalisation and capital mobility have made the international system more vulnerable to changes in investor sentiment. We all remember the severe financial crises that have occurred over the last 25 years, including the debt crises during the 1980s, starting with Poland and Mexico and spreading to Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union; the Mexican crisis in 1994; the Asian crisis starting in 1997; the Russian crisis in 1998; and the Argentinian crisis in 2001-02. All these events, irrespective of their origin or magnitude, posed major threats to the international financial system. While the international community has always managed to resolve such crises, they highlighted the potential vulnerabilities of the global economy, the resilience of which cannot be taken for granted. This is true even in a period characterised by high growth, low inflation and stability of financial markets such as the one we have been experiencing since 2003. Past financial crises or, in a more benign way, recent increases in risk awareness as reflected in higher asset price volatility, remind us of the relentless need to improve the functioning of mechanisms that deal with the prevention and resolution of such events.  BIS Review 57/2006 1 
I will focus on two issues today. First, I would like to take this opportunity to review the important contribution of the Paris Club to orderly sovereign debt restructuring over the last 50 years. Second, I will make some observations on recent international developments related to crisis prevention and resolution.  History and achievements of the Paris Club The fact that the Paris Club has enjoyed the trust of the international financial community for half a century now is due to its efficient way of dealing with sovereign debt restructuring by combining pragmatism with a strict set of principles to be implemented when working out agreements on debt restructuring. First, making decisions on a case-by-case basis allows Paris Club creditors to tailor their actions to the individual situation in each debtor country. Such an approach reflects a spirit of permanent adaptation to new financial problems and difficulties faced by rescheduling countries. Second, Paris Club treatments are agreed by consensus by all participating creditor countries. Third, creditor countries apply the principle of conditionality, whereby debt treatments are granted to countries only if they need debt relief and implement appropriate reforms to resolve their payment difficulties in the context of an IMF programme. Fourth, the principle of solidarity commits every Paris Club creditor, in its conclusion of individual bilateral agreements, to respect the terms agreed upon in the joint negotiation. Last but not least, the Paris Club attaches great value to comparability of treatment of all creditors. By insisting that a debtor country should not accept less favourable terms from another creditor than those agreed by consensus within the Paris Club, it is ensured that its taxpayers’ claims are not subordinated to those of other creditors and that their financial interests are preserved. Moreover, applying such a clause provides a guarantee that the agreed debt treatment reaches its intended goal of putting debtor countries’ debt burdens on a sustainable footing.  Keeping these principles in mind, what have been the main concrete achievements of the Paris Club? The first Paris Club restructuring took place, as mentioned, in 1956, when Argentina and its official creditors agreed to reschedule payments due on officially supported credits. At that time, the Club had no formal rules or procedures and was only intended to provide pragmatic responses to specific problems. Until 1980, Paris Club creditors on average signed no more than four agreements per year, applying the standard “classic terms”, whereby credits were rescheduled at the appropriate market rate. During these early years of the Paris Club, negotiations and agreements were more and more standardised, preparing this forum for the busy times that were to come.  I remember well those years of intense negotiations and the overall activities of the Club. I remember well the members of the Club at the time and I see some of them here in this room. To you I would like to express all my friendship and gratitude. We had intense discussions but it was always possible to find solutions because the members of the Club had an extraordinary level of both professionalism and mutual confidence.  I remember well the officials and members of governments of the debtor countries, officials from Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Poland, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco, the Soviet Union and Russia, and so many more. Among all those officials let me mention Angel Gurría, the present Secretary General of the OECD, who was the first negotiator I encountered, defending the interests of Mexico with remarkable professionalism and lucidity. I remember well the major partners of the Club in the period from 1982-1993 in both the public and private sectors. I would like to mention the names of Jacques de Larosière and Michel Camdessus in the IMF, Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan and Bill McDonnough from the Federal Reserve, Bill Rhodes as regards the private sector rescheduling. Without all those remarkable people, without their lucidity and tireless activity the world would not have been able to surmount difficulties of an enormous global magnitude. The Paris Club felt the fall-out from this crisis as its workload increased exponentially: the number of agreements concluded rose to well above ten per annum and reached an all-time high of 24 in 1989. Many countries negotiated multiple debt agreements with the Paris Club. They were coming from all over the globe, the bulk from sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, but also from Asia (the Philippines), the Middle East (Egypt and Jordan) and central and eastern Europe (Poland, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria).  2 BIS Review 57/2006 
While the Paris Club confined its mandate solely to debt rescheduling up to 1988, it changed radically its modus operandi in the late 1980s, given the severe impact of debt crises on the poorest and most highly indebted countries. The Paris Club adopted a completely new approach to the treatment of debt of those countries whose debt burdens remained unsustainable. It agreed to reduce the net present value of eligible debt, thus moving to increasingly concessional rescheduling terms, which have in fact included a reduction of up to a third since 1988 under the Toronto terms, a half since 1991 under the London terms, and two-thirds since 1995 under the Naples terms. On the latter occasion, the Paris Club agreed for the first time to also consider implementing stock treatment – and not only flow relief, as had been done until that time – to facilitate an exit from repeated reschedulings. Finally, middle-income countries benefited from the introduction of the more favourable Houston terms in 1990.  When it became clear that even the more concessional debt rescheduling and reduction mechanisms were still not sufficient to attain sustainable external debt levels, particularly in a number of African low-income countries, another key policy initiative was launched in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank: the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). Under this initiative, the entire international community, including some multilateral institutions, decided to take coordinated action to reduce the debt burdens of eligible countries to sustainable levels. In this context, Paris Club creditors agreed to increase the reduction in the net present value of eligible debt up to 80% under the Lyon terms and, in 2000, up to 90% or even more under the Cologne terms. The financial implications of these decisions were substantial: around 36% of the initiative’s total cost, amounting to USD 38 billion thus far, has been borne by Paris Club creditors. Finally, the HIPC initiative has been supplemented in 2005 by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, which allows for 100% debt relief by multilateral institutions for countries completing the HIPC process. This marked a major break with the principle of preferred creditor status of international financial institutions. Looking at the most recent past of the Paris Club, another development worth noting is that the number of countries rescheduling with Paris Club creditors has been declining significantly. Besides the more general macroeconomic developments I recalled at the beginning of this talk, this desirable trend is also due to two more specific developments: first, the more comprehensive debt stock treatment of low income countries; and second, a graduation from rescheduling of most middle-income countries as a result of the implementation of economic reforms that have increased their access to market financing and thus private creditors. Indeed, while official flows to emerging markets were dominant in the 1980s, reaching on average over 60% of total flows, the 1990s saw a dramatic increase in private flows, which on average accounted for around 85% in the period from 1990 until 2003. Accordingly, the Paris Club has been paying increasing attention to coordination with private sector creditors. In particular, early discussions can be scheduled when the proportion of private external debt is deemed significant and when comparability of treatment is an issue. Also, interaction between Paris Club creditors and private sector representatives can be initiated if private creditors indicate their willingness to help restore debt sustainability in good faith and if a comprehensive debt treatment is envisaged. As a result of the enhanced access by middle-income countries to market financing, the Paris Club has already concluded an increasing number of prepayment agreements with debtor countries. Recent such agreements include Poland, the Russian Federation, Peru and Brazil. In passing, let me mention that the IMF is making a similar experience as it has been facing a considerable decline in demand for its resources during recent years.  Let me conclude this part of my talk by responding to those who claim that the Paris Club lacks transparency and predictability. I would argue that, quite to the contrary, the rules applied by the Paris Club are clear, transparent and well-tailored to address different country groupings. In particular, while the Club’s classic terms are standard treatment, the Houston terms, the Naples terms and the Cologne terms are applied respectively to highly-indebted lower-middle-income countries, highly-indebted poor countries, and countries eligible for the HIPC initiative. Moreover, being embedded in the international financial system, the Paris Club works closely not only with creditor and debtor countries, but also with the IMF and market participants. Crisis prevention and resolution In my reflections, I have presented the Paris Club as an important forum for negotiations, both between the creditor countries and individual debtor countries and among the creditors themselves. I now wish to take a wider perspective and share with you some thoughts on where the international community stands in the area of crisis prevention and resolution. BIS Review 57/2006 3 
Starting with crisis prevention, I would like to underline the growing number of initiatives undertaken by policy-makers and market participants to improve transparency and promote best practices. One of the weaknesses identified during the financial crises of the 1990s was that there had been considerable information asymmetries between local authorities, market participants, and the international financial institutions. Transparency is a key precondition for well-functioning markets since it facilitates better risk management and leads to strengthened market discipline. It is therefore welcome that significant changes have been introduced in a number of fields. For example, the IMF started to disclose information on its policies and to encourage increased transparency by its membership. A large number of international standards and codes of good practice have been agreed upon, covering such different fields as transparency in fiscal policy or monetary and financial policies, banking supervision, corporate governance, accounting and auditing. The Paris Club has in turn also taken steps to increase the transparency of its procedures, for instance by convening meetings with private sector representatives and by providing comprehensive information on its website.  Turning to crisis management and resolution, I would argue that important lessons have been learnt from past experiences. Discussions have continued on the appropriate involvement of the private sector in solving debt crises. This is not only important because the availability of official funds is limited, but also because there are moral hazard concerns associated with large financial assistance provided by the official sector. Since every single crisis is different, the challenge arises again and again to strike the right balance between the debtor country’s domestic adjustment, private sector involvement and official support. As regards the role of the official sector in the area of crisis management, work continues at the IMF on a number of issues in the context of the strategic review of its activities. First, an open issue is the lack of clear guidelines for involvement of the IMF in the process of sovereign debt restructuring in the event a country faces an unsustainable debt situation. The case of Argentina is an example of a very difficult debt restructuring process. It is crucial that authorities cooperate closely with their creditors, while the IMF remains closely involved in the process and takes an active role in providing information. In that context, further discussions will be needed on how the Fund should financially support a country that is in the process of renegotiating its debt with private creditors, i.e. the lending-into-arrears policy. Second, discussions continue on the framework for large financial assistance programmes – the so-called exceptional access policy – that sets guidelines in order to make Fund lending more predictable. Finally, proposals are being examined for a possible new instrument to provide high access contingent financing. All in all, what is important in these different discussions in my view is to increase predictability and clarity on the part of the official sector so as to set the right incentives for all the actors involved. While there are several issues that still need to be addressed in the context of crisis resolution, substantial progress has been achieved on two fronts, both aimed to improve debtor-creditor relations and define ex ante the best conditions to address possible financial crises leading to debt restructuring. By doing so, these two initiatives are eventually also beneficial in terms of crisis prevention. First, following the pioneering issuance by Mexico of bonds with collective action clauses (CACs) in February 2003, the adoption of CACs in international sovereign bonds has become much more widespread. Practically all international sovereign bonds issued since mid-2005 contain CACs, which, while not yet being tested, have by now become the market standard. As is confirmed by market participants, the inclusion of CACs has not affected the pricing of international sovereign bonds, as was initially feared. The share of outstanding bonds including CACs increased, as a result, to 60% at the end of February 2006. This means that we are gradually moving towards a time when the entire stock of outstanding debt will include CACs. I deem this development remarkable, in particular in view of the rather sceptical attitude that many countries and private sector representatives had taken in the past vis-à-vis the recommendations of the Rey report published after the 1994 Mexican crisis. Second, I am pleased to note that the Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets, which were endorsed by the G20 in November 2004, are gaining more and more international support. The aim of these market-based and voluntary Principles is to provide guidelines for the behaviour of sovereign issuers and their private creditors regarding information sharing, dialogue, and close cooperation in times of financial distress. From the outset, I have been personally involved in the launch of the Principles since I promoted the idea that such guidelines carry the potential to help prevent liquidity problems from turning into a deep financial crisis with serious repercussions for all parties involved. The Principles are also likely to improve the handling of possible future private sector debt restructurings.  4 BIS Review 57/2006 
Conclusion In my view, seen over a long-term horizon, the concept of the Paris Club seems to have been in many respects a precursor signalling some of the main features that later proved appropriate to handle the very stimulating but complex globalised economy and finance of the world today. First the Paris club was global from the start. It is remarkable that as early as 1956 in the case of Argentina it appeared necessary to embark on a single concept for public credits restructuring and not on a series of bilateral agreements. In the same way, as soon as some creditors from the emerging world expressed the desire to participate in the activities of the group of creditors they were accepted. Brazil was a creditor of Poland, for example.  Second, the Paris Club was and is open and transparent. It was a bold initiative at the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s to invite all international institutions, in particular the IMF, the World Bank and the Regional Development Banks, together with the United Nations UNDP and the OECD to participate in the discussions and/or observe the rescheduling negotiations. This unseen level of transparency would compare with the very discrete bilateral negotiations that were the norm before the setting-up of the Club. Third, the Paris Club was and is based on a set of principles that are applied by all parties concerned in a purely voluntary fashion. There was no setting-up of a new institution, no new official piece of legislation or regulation. Globalisation and global ownership, transaparency and voluntary implementation of principles are, in my view, three of the major avenues that have proved not only necessary but also very successful in the world today. I would particularly stress the systemic importance of the codes of good conduct and good practices, reflected now in the “Principles”, that are agreed upon by a very large degree of global consensus, are voluntary and incorporate enhanced transparency. This is a key to better understanding today's global trends in international economics and finance. I feel proud, along with all those in this room I am sure, that the Paris Club may be among the first to invent and try out what was and is so promising. I thank you for your attention.

Seong-Tae Lee: Monetary policy in an environment of low inflation Opening address by Mr Seong-Tae Lee, Governor and Chairman of The Bank of Korea, at The Bank of Korea International Conference 2006, Seoul, 16 June 2006. *      *      * Greetings Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here to express my warm welcome to all of you attending "The Bank of Korea International Conference 2006". I would like to extend particular gratitude to our keynote speaker, Professor Frederic Mishkin of Columbia University; to our luncheon speaker, President Un-Chan Jung of Seoul National University; to President William Poole of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; and to our other chairpersons, speakers and discussants, for taking time out from their busy schedules to be with us today. This year's conference, marking the 56th anniversary of the Bank of Korea's establishment, deals with the theme of "Monetary Policy in an Environment of Low Inflation". Many central banks including the Bank of Korea are currently facing difficulties conducting monetary policy in the new environment characterized by low inflation. In this regard, I believe that today's conference is very meaningful and most timely. Conducting monetary policy under low inflation As we are all aware, inflation throughout the world has declined since the mid-1990s. This is mainly attributable to the emergence on the global stage of vast low-wage economies such as China and India; to productivity gains made possible by information technology (IT) development; and to intensified competition in both domestic and global markets. In addition to all of these factors, the increased credibility of central banks is also believed to have contributed to low inflation. Over the years, central banks around the world have been resolute in their pursuit of price stability, while working hard to enhance their capabilities in the conduct of monetary policy. Together with the continuing price stability, this has helped lower the inflation expectations of economic agents. The case is much the same in Korea. Both consumer price and core inflation rates are running at levels some two percentage points lower than those we saw here prior to the currency crisis. Particularly, the rate of core inflation nowadays is moving substantially below the lower bound of the Bank of Korea's target range. In the last few months, upward price movements have been observed in several countries. However, rising prices on a scale similar to those of the past are no longer expected to reappear for the time being, as firms continue their efforts to improve productivity with the accelerating integration of the world economy. Although there is concern that the run-up in oil prices may serve as a factor causing price instability, oil has much less effect on inflation now than in the past. This is mainly due to declining oil-dependency in line with improved energy efficiency, to the stabilization of inflation expectations, and so on. This emergence of global low inflation is of course a welcome phenomenon for central banks, for whom price stability is the top priority. At the same time, however, it imposes upon them a new set of tasks. Above all, if monetary policy is conducted solely with an eye focused on price stability, factors representing threats to the stability of the whole economy could be overlooked. From early 2001, thanks to an environment of continued price stability, central banks around the world were able to combat economic slowdowns through substantial reductions of their policy rates. The continuance of low interest rate stances over a significant length of time, however, led to over-abundant supplies of liquidity with accompanying side effects including a sharp rise in asset prices. As we saw in the case of the Japanese asset bubble in the late 1980s, low inflation does not always guarantee financial and macroeconomic stability. BIS Review 57/2006 1 
How best to deal with such economic imbalances is a common problem that many central banks nowadays face. Particularly for those countries that have selected inflation targeting regimes, this challenge is even more serious. In the case of Korea, during the protracted period of low interest rates, real estate prices rose sharply with the large increase in household sector borrowings from financial institutions. This now imposes a burden on the Bank of Korea in its conduct of monetary policy. Another challenge confronting central banks in the current era of low inflation is the possibility of their policy response ability becoming blunted. If nominal interest rates are low, in line with a stabilization of inflation expectations, there is little room for central banks to act against a business recession. In particular, when nominal interest rates fall close to the zero bound due to deflation and other factors, there is likelihood of a loss of monetary policy effectiveness. Besides this, the response of the real economy to interest rates may change, and the sensitivity to inflationary pressures may lessen in an environment in which prices have remained low and stable over an extended period of time. We need to keep a careful eye on these phenomena. Closing remarks Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to a thorough and constructive debate on the various challenges facing central banks. I am sure that today's words of wisdom from many eminent professors and senior central bankers assembled here will be of great help to policy-makers at the Bank of Korea and other central banks as well. In closing, let me once again voice my deep gratitude to all of you taking part here, for sparing your precious time to be with us. Thank you very much. 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
Krzysztof Rybiński: Globalisation and its implications for monetary policy Address by Mr Krzysztof Rybiński, Deputy President of the National Bank of Poland, at a series of seminars by the Centre for European Regional and Local Studies and the UNESCO Chair, Warsaw University, Warsaw, 6 April 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, Globalisation is a term used frequently in the economic debate nowadays, and it would be difficult to find an area of economic research that is “globalisation-free”. However, its meaning is so broad, that when globalisation is referred to in a discussion, various people understand various things. For this very reason, a discussion on globalisation and the monetary policy should commence with an attempt to define the term. One of the definitions of globalisation is provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)1, where it is construed as “the growing interdependence (integration) of national economies, in particular as a result of the growing international trade and financial flows”. Moreover, an element of globalisation that is worth mentioning is the fast flow of information and knowledge, which is the driving force behind globalisation processes. One should keep in mind that globalisation is not a completely new phenomenon2. In view of the existence of political barriers to international trade, the flow of capital and goods was equally as possible one hundred years ago as it is today. It goes without saying, however, that as a result of the rapid development of technology, especially in the ICT area, which drastically lowered the cost of the said exchange, the international integration of trade, investment, financial and other services is now more advanced than it has ever been before. The Economic Policy Committee of the European Union3 points out four factors that have lead to the rapid development of globalisation over the past years:  • multilateral trade liberalisation; the average customs duty has been lowered by ca. 30% • successful economic reforms in many developing countries, especially in China and India • the technological advancement, especially in the ICT sector and transportation, which has significantly lowered the cost of trade. To give you and example, fees for sea, land and air transportation, telephone calls and satellite calls went down by 21%, 30%, 95% and 88%, respectively. • the technological advancement has blurred the borderline between what can and what cannot become subject to international trade. Globalisation may create new macroeconomic interdependences to replace the traditional ones that we know from the books on economics. The majority of economists, politicians and investors may still not quite keep at pace with the “seismic changes” that take place in the economy4. However, if we really are witnesses to “seismic changes” in the economy, it may be worthwhile to have a closer look and think about their meaning. Globalisation and its impact on the economy may be viewed from different perspectives. Today I would like us to look at globalisation from the perspective of a central bank, taking into consideration the objective of the central bank, its ability to contribute to the shape of the economy and the instruments that a central bank has at its disposal. To start with, let us consider what channels there are through which globalisation may impact the monetary policy and the central bank.                                                       1  “Economic globalization is a historical process, the result of human innovation and technological progress. It refers to the increasing integration of economies around the world, particularly through trade and financial flows. The term sometimes also refers to the movement of people (labor) and knowledge (technology) across international borders.” According to: “Globalization: Threat or Opportunity?” IMF Staff, April 12, 2000 (Corrected January 2002). 2  See e.g. Mussa M. “Factors Driving Global Economic Integration” presented in Jackson Hole, Wyoming at a symposium on “Global Opportunities and Challenges,” August 25, 2000. 3  Economic Policy Committee “Responding to the Challenges of Globalisation”, November 2005. 4  Roach S. “The New Macro of Globalization”, Morgan Stanley Global Economic Forum, 6 June 2005. BIS Review 57/2006 1 
Firstly, globalisation - through shaping real economic processes abroad, its influence on the global business cycle and commodity prices on global markets - influences the external environment of the national economy, which is monitored by the central bank and in which the central bank operates. Today, a central bank in a small open market economy, which would wish to turn a blind eye on the developments in the external environment and focus solely on the developments in the national economy, is doomed to failure. Secondly, globalisation changes the wage and price setting mechanisms in the national economy, which have an impact on the domestic inflation. Globalisation (the growing openness of economies) - through the growing share of countries with low manufacturing costs in the global output - increases the margin and wage pressures, in consequence lowering the inflation. At the same time, globalisation drives up  commodity prices, and thus contributes to - at least temporarily - increased inflation. Thirdly, increased international migration of workforce changes the situation on local labour markets. Where the workforce outflows, the wage pressures increase; in the case of  an inflow of workforce, the wage pressures go down.  Fourthly, globalisation changes the functioning of financial markets and increases the uncertainty as to the impact of decisions made by the central bank on these markets and on macroeconomic variables. Fifthly, globalisation has an impact on the central bank’s perception of the economic environment and the monetary policy strategy it applies. A fast transfer of the economic know-how (flow of the economic knowledge and analytical methods) changes the methods of economic analysis by central bank economists, as well as the way decisions regarding the monetary policy are made. Sixthly, globalisation increases the risk of speculative bubbles on the assets market. Let us have a step-by-step look at these channels of influence of globalisation on the monetary policy. Re 1) The growing share of international trade in the global output as well as the increasing international capital flows cause a situation, where the growth rate of a national economy depends increasingly on the developments of the global economy. To illustrate the impact of globalisation on the economic prospects, attention should be drawn to the hot topic in the macroeconomic policy, namely the problem of global imbalances.  To give you some facts, the US current account deficit had been growing gradually over the past years to exceed USD 800 billion, i.e. 6.5% of the U.S. GDP, last year. This deficit, which represents import of savings from the rest of the world to the USA, is financed by the Asian central banks, for example the Peoples Bank of China, and by oil-exporting countries. The available forecasts show that the deficit will continue to grow. An animated debate is currently underway to determine whether this is a steady situation that simply reflects the new principles in the global economy5, or whether this trend is bound to stop and reverse sooner or later, which may entail a significant increase in the US long-term interest rates, a strong depreciation of the US dollar and a serious slowdown in the global economic growth. The majority of empirical and theoretical studies indicates a growing probability of the latter scenario, especially if no due steps are taken in many countries. These steps include the necessity to accelerate the potential GDP growth in the European Union and Japan through reforms of the labour market and the product market, increasing savings in the US by curbing the budget deficit, and reforms of the financial sector in China and subsequent gradual floating of the renminbi exchange rate.  The central bank must consider possible scenarios of developments in the global economy and possible adjustments of global imbalances, as they significantly impact the perspectives of a national economy, and so the monetary policy pursued. Moreover, the central bank, as an institution that manages foreign exchange reserves, must monitor changes on the global financial market, as these changes and investment decisions made by the central bank influence the return on foreign exchange reserves.                                                       5  This thesis was advanced, among others, in the frequently quoted work: M.Dooley, D.Folkerts-Landau, P.Garber “An Essay on the Revived Bretton Woods System“, NBER Working Paper 9971, September 2003. 2 BIS Review 57/2006 
Re 2) Globalisation changes the wage and price setting mechanisms in a domestic economy. This ensues from the increased international competition and the growing role of outsourcing and offshoring. Offshoring consists in transferring of manufacturing, services or orders abroad, where such transfer may be made within a single company or to another company. Outsourcing consists in renouncing manufacturing or services in a given company and obtaining such goods or services from another company that may be located in the same or another country. In the past, the major part of the chain of manufacturing and services used to be located in a given country, which meant that, from the monetary policy perspective, the domestic demand was of great importance, and in particular - the size of output in relation to its potential level i.e. the so-called output gap. The impact of the global economy, on the other hand, was observed mainly due to changes in the terms-of-trade i.e. the ratio of export to import prices, which in turn was affected by, among others, commodity prices and changes in external demand. Nowadays, inter alia as a result of globalisation of production and services, the role of the domestic output gap in explaining inflation has decreased significantly, as shown by the BIS research6. As in the case of the model applied by the NBP in forecasting inflation, the role of the output gap as a factor that determines inflation is much smaller than it used to be.  In old books on macroeconomics inflation is treated largely as a local development, i.e. dependent in a great measure on domestic factors (such as the domestic output gap and inflation expectations). Today, inflation is becoming increasingly less local, and in turn, becomes more and more dependent on global factors, i.e. the relationship between global demand to global supply. Research that analysed the course of inflation in 22 OECD countries between 1960 and 2003 has shown that 70% of inflation volatility may be explained by a common factor7. This global, common factor explains not only the change in the inflation trend (the increasing inflation between 1960 and 1980 and its subsequent decrease), but also inflation fluctuation over a business cycle. The research has also shown that, where domestic inflation deviates from the “global” inflation, it exhibits a “global-inflation-reverting” tendency. As a consequence, modelling and forecasting of domestic inflation may be improved significantly by taking into account the “global inflation”. The fast-progressing globalisation is closely related to offshoring and outsourcing, whose scope is also growing. Unfortunately there is not much hard data that would allow for assessment of the scale of the phenomenon. Offshoring analysis is available only for selected countries and covers only selected industries. However, the growing scale of the phenomenon is reflected by data on global trade in goods and services and on foreign direct investment. Over the past 15 years, the shares of individual regions in the global trade have changed significantly, whereby the decreasing share of the EU is accompanied by increasing shares of the developing countries, including the Asian countries. Globally, foreign trade expressed as percentage of the GDP increased from the average 19% of the GDP between 1980 and 1989 up to 25% between 2000 and 2004. Table 1. Shares of individual regions in global trade % Total 1990 1995 2002 Developed countries 72 67 63 US 12 12 11 UE15 44 39 38 Developing countries 28 33 37 Asia 13 19 20 Source: IMF Direction of Trade Statistics                                                       6  BIS 75th Annual Report, 2005. 7  Ciccarelli, Mojon “Global Inflation”, Central Bank of Chile Working Papers No 357, December 2005. BIS Review 57/2006 3 
Global capital flows keep growing even more dynamically, whereby the share of the global FDI in the global GDP increased from 8% in 1989 to 22.1% in 2003, and foreign assets expressed as percentage of the GDP increased from 62.6% of the GDP to 186.1% of the GDP, respectively.  As evidenced, the role of trade and financial links between enterprises in various countries has become more important over recent years. Previously, in response to growing fuel prices or costs of living, trade unions demanded wage increases, which triggered the so-called second-round effects and central banks had to increase interest rates to mitigate inflation. Nowadays, trade unions must take into account the fact that in the case of wage increases, production and services may be transferred to countries with lower manufacturing costs.  In EU Member States, between 2002 and November 2005, 202 cases of the restructuring of companies related to offshoring were publicly announced, which resulted in the transfer of nearly one hundred thousand jobs. Over that period, offshoring stood behind nearly six per cent of all cases of publicly announced restructurings of companies in the EU. So far, the scale of the phenomenon has not been large. However, offshoring as a strategy of increasing competitiveness is becoming more and more common and includes not only the manufacturing of products but also - increasingly - services.  Table 2. Offshoring in EU member states Countries to which job transfer took place  Number of jobs liquidated in the EU between 2002 and 2003 due to transfer of jobs Number of jobs liquidated in the EU between January and November 2005 due to transfer of jobs China 3361 3077 India 9458 5470 Asian countries 3786 3271 Czech Republic 780 3890 Hungary 1110 772 Poland 120 2676  33151 31942 Source: European Restructuring Monitor8, own calculations Numerous analyses show that the process of offshoring is bound to grow and increasingly affect services9. For example, between 1980 and 2002 the trade in goods and services grew at 6.9%. According to forecasts by McKinsey Global Institute, off-shoring of services to countries with low manufacturing costs in the years 2003 – 2008 is going to grow at a rate of 30% annually. In 2003, the global trade in services was ca. USD 1.7 trillion, of which a mere 3% resulted from offshoring to low cost countries. It is expected that in 2008 the global trade in services will amount to ca. USD 2.4 trillion, of which 10% will represent offshoring of business and ICT processes to low cost countries. To compare, the travel industry represents 30% of trade in services in the OECD data, whereby transportation - 20%. Based upon an analysis of eight representative sectors, McKinsey Global Institute estimated that in 2003, 18.3 million jobs in services could have been transferred to other locations (this applies mainly to sectors such as IT - 2.8 million, banking - 3.3 million, insurance - 2.3 million, healthcare - 4.6 million and retail sales - 4.3 million). Extrapolating the results for the global economy, it may be estimated that in 2008 ca. 160 million jobs in services, i.e. 11% of the global employment in services estimated at 1.46 billion, may theoretically be performed at a distance from the customer.                                                        8  European Restructuring Monitor is the European Commission service.

From the monetary policy perspective, it is important to properly understand the impact of offshoring on the functioning of local labour markets, which - as a result of ever greater opening of the economies - have merged into one global labour market. Before the fall of socialism in European countries, the then global market amounted to ca. one billion people. Nowadays, i.e. after China and India have joined the global economy, the market comprises ca. four billion people. This brings about a situation where jobs are being transferred to new, more attractive locations and people increasingly move in search for better-paid jobs. The largest migration known as “the great migration” is taking place in China10. According to estimates, over the next 10 years ca. 200 million Chinese will migrate from villages to cities and find employment in industry - to a large extent in export-oriented industry sectors - and in services. This means that over the next 10 years, every month one to two million Chinese on average will give up their low-paid, low-productivity jobs in agriculture and take up better-paid and more productive work in other sectors. The monetary policy must take into account the impact that this process is going to have on the Chinese economy and on economies of other countries.  As opposed to trade and capital, the flow of people within EU Member States was stable. The annual net migration to EU-15 remained at a level of less than 5 people per 1000 inhabitants over the past 40 years. Approximately 9% of EU population was born in other countries, whilst in the USA this figure was 12% and ca. 20% in Canada and Australia. However, following the EU enlargement, where 10 new members joined the structures, our part of the world has also seen an increase in migration, which is shown in Table 3 below. In some cases, a significant part of the domestic work force took up employment in other countries. The estimates show that, for example, ca. 5% of Lithuanians took up employment in countries that opened their labour markets for the new EU Member States following 1 May 2004. A conclusion may be drawn that opening of the low cost economies, especially of the Chinese economy, and the increasing international competition on the market of goods and services related thereto, changes the methods of setting prices by enterprises and determining wages on the labour market. Enterprises are increasingly becoming price-takers, and thus even in a situation of rising costs of manufacturing, they are unable to lift prices and shift the growing costs onto the customer. Similar is true for wages, whose level is determined on the increasingly global labour market. Research on the manufacturing sector in EU Members States (for the years 1988 - 2000) has shown that the increase in the openness of that sector (growing import) caused a fall of prices by 2.3%, a growth in productivity by 11% and a drop in margins by 1.6%. Altogether, it may explain the inflation fall by 0.14% in annual terms over that period11. When looking at the price processes from the microeconomic perspective, vital structural changes can be observed, which bring about lower inflation.  Table 3.

Analysts also point out that the dynamically growing Chinese economy, which uses more and more commodities, contributes to a significant increase in their prices, and may potentially drive up inflation. However, considering the increased competitive pressure, the possibility of shifting higher cost of commodities (e.g. oil) onto the final prices is limited12. In addition, in view of fierce competition on the labour market and the changes referred to above, the risk of growing wage demands is limited, and so are the so-called second-round effects.  Re 3) Over the past three decades, the financial sector has become highly international. Financial services, provided under strictly regulated, separate, domestic financial systems in the past, are now provided under ever more open, competitive and global system. One of the measures of globalisation in the financial services sector is the growing volume of cross-border capital flows. Cross-border transactions in the bonds and shares segment are now exceeding 90 trillion (thousand billion) US dollars per annum, which translates into USD 250 billion daily13. Moreover, the size of financial markets and their meaning to the global economy becomes ever greater. According to McKinsey Global Institute14, the total value of global financial assets is now USD 118 trillion, whilst as far back as in 1980 they were only 12 trillion. The increase in the volume of financial assets is progressing at a higher rate than that of output, and has now reached a threefold of the global GDP, whilst back in 1980 it was approximately equal to the world output. Additionally, the fastest growing segment of the financial market is the segment of private debt securities. What is more, international issues of these securities grow at a higher rate than domestic issues, which means that companies increasingly finance their activities from funds raised abroad. Additionally, an important feature of development of the financial market is the gradual fall in significance of intermediation of the banking sector with a simultaneous increase of significance of the market intermediation15. As a consequence, the central bank’s channels of influence on the economy are changing. In the past the bank loan channel was deemed more important; it is now loosing its significance in relative terms. Until recently, the investment rate in the economy was to a large extent dependent on the domestic savings rate, which by the way was contradictory to one of the fundamental assumptions of some economic models of the full integration of capital markets. The economy was featured by the so-called home bias i.e. greater inclination of domestic investors to invest in domestic assets rather than in foreign assets16. The latest research17 suggests that home bias over the past years could have dropped significantly, at least in the OECD countries. The decrease may be attributed to the very growth of cross-border capital flows. What does that mean to the monetary policy? If domestic and foreign financial assets are treated more and more as perfect substitutes, domestic interest rates, especially mid- an long-term ones, are determined on the global market, and thus the influence of particular central banks on their level is weakened. This phenomenon is already observed in the USA.                                                       12  Melick W., Galati G. “The Evolving Inflation Process: an Overview”, BIS Working Paper No 196, 2006. 13  Hannoun H. “Internationalisation of financial services: implications and challenges for central banks”, Conference of the SEACEN Governors Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam, 4 March 2006. 14  McKinsey Global Institute, $118 Trillion and Counting: Taking Stock of the World’s Capital Markets, February 2005. 15  In 1980 bank deposits accounted for 45% of total financial assets, currently their share dropped to 30% (McKinsey Global Institute 2005 – ibidem). 16  It is called the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle, after the two economists, who were the first to empirically prove its existence (Feldstein, 2005). 17  Feldstein M. Monetary Policy in a Changing International Environment: The Role of Capital Flows, NBER Working Paper 11856, 2005. 6 BIS Review 57/2006 
Although the key interest rate of the central bank has been raised from 1.00% in 2004 to 4.75% at present (i.e. by 3.75 percentage points), long-term interest rates, which are more important from the aggregate demand perspective, have remained roughly unchanged18. As a result, the effect of tightening the monetary policy on the aggregate demand has been significantly contained due to lack of response from long-term interest rates. In the world of global financial markets nobody seems to be surprised by the fact that during the session of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC19) of the American Federal Reserve, the eyes of the entire financial market are fixed on its Chairman. Why is that? Decisions made by the FOMC in Washington are equally as important for investors in New York as those in London, Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro, Shanghai or even Warsaw. Not only do the FOMC decisions influence US economy, but also - via the financial markets channel - the entire global economy. An unexpected increase in interest rates in the USA may bring about a sudden outflow of capital from the emerging markets, and thus weaken the currencies of those countries and increase their bond yields. Some economists20 make the point that an important aspect of the growing internationalisation of financial markets is increased discipline, which is extorted by investors on governments and central banks in individual countries. According to this hypothesis, the financial markets, through their continuous valuation of securities, duly reward good and punish bad economic policies. However, the empirical results do not provide hard evidence to support the thesis on fiscal policy discipline. It may be stated, on the other hand, that financial globalisation may have contributed to the discipline of central banks and to “forcing” them to conduct a monetary policy focused on low and stable inflation21. At the same time, a significant risk related to the financial markets integration is the possibility to shift economic problems of one country upon other countries, which is greater than before (the contagion effect). Between 1997 and 1998, countries of South-East Asia experienced this effect, when all of a sudden capital flew out, bringing about financial crisis in economy after economy, which could not be prevented by either the monetary or exchange rate policy. Re 4) One of the vital dimensions of globalisation is the fast spreading of knowledge, technology and know-how. The flow of know-how also applies to the public sector, including the central bank. One of the features of modern central banking is gradual homogenisation of the strategies applied to the monetary policy. Since 1990, when for the first time the central bank of New Zealand started to implement the strategy of direct inflation targeting (DIT), over 20 central banks followed and adopted that strategy. As a result, the DIT strategy (applied since 1998 by the NBP) is now the dominating strategy of the monetary policy, applied by the majority of central banks in developed countries22, and more and more, by central banks of the developing countries (such as Turkey, the Philippines, Ghana, Romania and Armenia). A bloom of the DIT strategy endorses the observation that central banks adopt the “technology” of low and stable inflation from one another. The dissemination of the DIT strategy was accompanied by a decrease in the average inflation level, especially in the developing countries that lowered inflation from a high level. This may prove that the dissemination of the DIT strategy was one of the factors that have contributed to disinflation. Admittedly, the impact of the DIT strategy on lowering inflation is a subject matter of discussion23; however, empirical evidence exists that implementation of the DIT strategy improves macroeconomic                                                       18  This is even called the Greenspan’s conundrum, after the name of the former Chairman of the US Federal Reserve. 19  FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee): the decision-making authority on interest rates in the Management  Board of the US Federal Reserve. 20  Hannoun H. – ibidem. 21  Tytell I., Wei S-J. “Does Financial Globalization Induce Better Macroeconomic Policies?”, IMF Working Paper 04/84, May 2004. 22  The DIT strategy is applied in most developed countries outside the euro area and the USA. However, in the case of the euro area, one may talk of the de facto DIT strategy, and in the case of the USA – the current Chairman, Fed Ben Bernanke, is a zealous DIT enthusiast, so its implementation in the USA soon is not out of question. 23  See e.g. “Does Inflation Targeting Matter?” Ball L., Sheridan N. in: ”The Inflation-Targeting Debate” Bernanke B.S., Woodford M. (2005). BIS Review 57/2006 7 
outcomes (lower costs of stabilising inflation, decreased influence of price shocks and output shocks on inflation, thereby - decreased effect of past inflation on the current inflation, which reduces inflation persistence)24. Empirical research also suggests that the DIT strategy facilitates stabilisation of long-term inflation expectations25. An additional result of dissemination of the DIT strategy is elaboration of standards of communication in conducting the monetary policy (announcements of decision-making authorities, inflation reports and published inflation projections), which facilitate contacts of the central bank with the external environment (the financial market and the general public). It may be speculated that these standards make the interpretation of the decisions made by the central bank easier for foreign investors, which should, under the huge cross-border capital flows, increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy in stabilising inflation. Re 6) As mentioned before, the process of globalisation is a serious challenge for central banks. Following the increase in human workforce relatively to the capital resource, the pay of the workforce has gone down, and so did the costs of manufacturing of many goods and services. Setting fuel prices apart, whose increase is also brought about by globalisation, inflation in many countries remains very low, whereas a strong increase in the global labour supply mitigates the possibility of occurrence of the second-round effects i.e. wage increases in response to a rise in current inflation. On the other hand, the global surplus of savings over investments causes the capital to chase the high yield opportunities, thus increasing asset prices in many countries. An exemplary case may be increases in stock exchange indices, bond prices or real property prices in Anglo-Saxon countries and e.g. in Spain. As a logical consequence, a question arises about how the monetary policy should be conducted in these circumstances, and in particular, whether it should respond to the increase in asset prices despite the fact that inflation of consumer goods and services remains low or very low. Another vital question arises about the appropriate level of central bank interest rates when long-term interest rates remain low, possibly as a result of globalisation. A hot debate accompanies the issue, both among the central bankers26 and among academics.27  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, in his address28 last month, presented possible diagnoses regarding the sources of low interest rates on the bond market despite as many as fourteen increases in the central bank references rates. There are at least two explanations of such situation. If the long-term interest rates remain unchanged and the short-term ones increase, this means that either the markets pessimistically assess the perspectives of economic growth or the risk premium related to forward rates decreases; here this may be the inflation risk premium or real interest rates volatility risk premium. Another explanation may be the very effect of global imbalances, i.e. the result of large purchases of sovereign bonds by Asian central banks and oil- exporting countries. Depending on which hypothesis is true, the implications for the monetary policy are different. If the long-term rates go down as a result of poor growth prospects, the current short-term interest rates should be lowered respectively so as to prevent possible deflation. If, however, specific factors related to globalisation or decrease in the risk premium are the cause of persisting low long-term interest rates, the short-term interest rate should be higher in order to achieve appropriate restrictiveness of the monetary policy                                                       24  See Corbo V., Landerretche O., Schmidt-Hebbel K. “Does Inflation Targeting Make a Difference” in: N.

Soto (red.) “Inflation Targeting: Design, Performance, Challenges” (Central Bank of Chile: Santiago 2002). 25  Gürkaynak R.S., Levin A.T., Marder A.N., Swanson E.T. “Inflation Targeting and the Anchoring of Inflation Expectations in the Western Hemisphere”, forthcoming in Mishkin, Frederic and Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel (red.), Series on Central Banking, Analysis and Economic Policies X: Monetary Policy under Inflation Targeting (Santiago, Chile: Banco Central de Chile), 2006 and Gürkaynak R.S., Levin A.T.

Evidence from Long-Term Bond Yields in the U.S., U.K., and Sweden”, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Working Paper 2006-09, March 2006. 26  For example a question whether monetary policy should burst asset bubbles was hotly debated during the large European Central Bank conference on 16 to17 March 2006. 27  The examples are the following articles: N. Roubini “Why Central Banks Should Burst Bubbles”, mimeo, Stern School of Business and Roubini Global Economics, January 2006, and A.

Bernanke Before the Economic Club of New York, 20 March 2006. 8 BIS Review 57/2006 
resulting from the entire yield curve. While it is difficult to assess which hypothesis is correct, central banks, as sailors did in the old days, should apply two iron rules: firstly, frequently determine their position, secondly, use as many waypoints as possible. This means that, especially where new phenomena emerge or there are structural transformations, the monetary policy must not be described using just a few simple indicators, as e.g. inflation and output gap in the Taylor rule. Monetary policy decisions should rather be a product of a complex analysis of a number of indicators and data and cross-checked with qualitative information. In turn, another Federal Reserve governor, Donald Kohn29, devoted his recent address to the analysis of when and on what conditions the central banks should respond to rapid changes of asset prices. In Kohn’s opinion, there are two possible approaches. According to one of them, described as the conventional monetary policy, the central bank focuses on stabilising the inflation, treats changes in asset prices as an exogenous process and does not attempt to influence asset prices whatsoever. The other option, described by Kohn as the “extra action policy”, allows for a deviation of current inflation from a level determined as stable in return for improvement of the perspectives of achieving price stability in the future. However, the extra action policy does not mean piercing the speculative bubbles by central banks, and means rather “taking out” of additional insurance against possible negative shocks, which may happen in the future. In Kohn’s opinion, the extra action policy may be run very rarely and only where the three conditions are met: • the central bank must be able to identify asset bubbles in a timely manner and high certainty as to the correctness of analysis conclusions; • there must be a high probability that a slight tightening of the monetary policy will be able to stand against the speculative activity on a given assets market; • the expected improvement of the future economic situation resulting from a smaller speculative bubble must be significant and higher than the costs incurred by the economy in the aftermath of running the extra action policy. To recapitulate this train of thought, Kohn was very sceptical whether the three above-mentioned conditions can be sufficiently met; however, he did not preclude that in the future, the understanding of economic processes will improve as much as to enable running the extra action policy where reasonable. Numerous statements following the presentation have indicated that the proper supervision is much better a response to the asset bubbles and many people have stressed that this is why the financial markets supervision should be independent of politicians, as it may be necessary to take actions aimed to restrict the speed of the speculative bubbles build-up , when this does not suit certain politicians due to the elections cycle. The majority of lectures which are delivered over the series of seminars by the Centre for European Regional and Local Studies and the UNESCO Chair at Warsaw University apply to the issues vital for local communities. The title of today’s seminar might suggest that we have discussed problems vital for the global economy and not for a local community, a city, a region or a university/higher education institution. This is not the case, however, as in the years to come the globalisation of manufacturing, services, investments, finances, the labour market and knowledge will progress, irrespective of the scale of national protectionism. The globalisation results will be thus felt by all: countries, regions, local communities and individuals. If we want to succeed, both as a country and as each and every one of us, we must be well prepared for globalisation. Thank you very much for your attention.                                                       29  D.

Susan Schmidt Bies: A supervisor's perspective on mortgage markets and mortgage lending practices  Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Mortgage Bankers Association Presidents Conference, Half Moon Bay, California, 14 June 2006. *      *      * Good morning. It is a pleasure to be here today, and I thank you for the invitation. It almost goes without saying that over the past several years, residential housing markets have been attracting considerable attention, and they have been a strong contributor to the overall growth of the U.S. economy. Today I would like to offer some thoughts on the current state of both residential and commercial mortgage markets and then discuss some ways in which U.S. bank supervisors are trying to ensure that bank lending in those markets is safe and sound.  Conditions in real estate markets Residential real estate markets Activity in U.S. housing markets is slowing. Incoming data point to a decided, but so far moderate, cooling. Starts of single-family houses fell appreciably in March and April. Because construction had been spurred in the preceding months by unusually mild weather, some slowing in the spring was natural. However, the level of housing starts lately has fallen below not just the elevated winter pace but also the pace of last fall. Indeed, construction permit issuance for single-family homes, which is less affected by the weather, has been declining since September. Sales of new and existing homes have dropped noticeably from their highs of last year. In addition, inventories of unsold homes have increased, and your own MBA index of loan applications for home purchases has trended lower in recent months. Although a slowdown in housing activity is apparent in a wide range of indicators, it seems to be occurring in a gradual way. Notwithstanding their recent slip, both home construction and home sales are still at relatively high levels. The underlying fundamentals of housing demand also remain favorable. Real disposable income is growing at a solid pace. In the aggregate, household balance sheets appear to be in a good position, even though risks clearly exist for some households. Long-term mortgage rates, although up substantially from last summer's level, remain low relative to their historical experience. The latest data on house prices from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight suggest that house-price appreciation has moderated but that prices in the aggregate continue to move up. Between the first quarter of 2005 and the first quarter of this year, the price index for existing homes sold in repeat transactions increased 10 percent - a solid gain but down a bit from the record pace for the period mid-2004 to mid-2005. Focusing on the first quarter of 2006 alone, prices increased at an annual rate of 7.3 percent. However, quarterly figures should be treated with a good degree of caution given the volatility of this data series. Given the slowing conditions in the housing market, spending for the construction of new housing is unlikely to be an important direct source of overall GDP growth this year, after having contributed close to ½ percentage point last year. In addition, the slackening of house-price appreciation could hold back growth in consumption spending through the so-called wealth effect, or the effect that lower overall housing wealth has on consumption. Estimates from various econometric models of consumer spending suggest that each dollar of change in wealth is associated with a change in consumption of approximately 3½ cents, with roughly half of the effect occurring within a year. Of course, these consumption estimates are just that - estimates. Beyond the usual issues of measurement and interpretation associated with any statistical estimate, one can easily point to some specific risks in estimating how housing wealth affects spending. First, econometric modeling has had difficulty distinguishing between the effects of movements in housing wealth and movements in other components of household balance sheets, even though housing may be a unique asset in a number of ways. Thus, the estimate of change in consumption that I cited is based on the historical relationship BIS Review 57/2006 1 
between spending and changes in overall wealth. Changes in housing wealth may have a somewhat different effect. Second, the linkages between housing wealth and consumption may change over time. For example, these linkages may be stronger now than in the past because financial innovation has made it easier and less costly for households to tap their accumulated housing equity. Third, a pronounced deceleration in house prices could have an outsized effect on consumer confidence, and such a decline in confidence could be an additional damping force on consumption. Another housing-related issue that bears watching is mortgage debt accumulation. Since the end of 2002, home mortgage debt outstanding has risen about 50 percent. The increase has substantially pushed up homeowners' mortgage payments in relation to their income, in spite of historically low mortgage rates, the growing use of interest-only mortgages, and the lengthening of average loan maturities over the past few years. That said, homeowners appear to be able to manage these higher payments: we have seen only a little deterioration in mortgage credit quality as yet, and overall delinquency rates remain low. Going forward, I expect aggregate homeowner mortgage payments to continue to rise, especially as adjustable-rate mortgages reach their initial reset dates. However, these reset adjustments are expected to be gradual, and only a modest number of outstanding mortgages are expected to reset during 2006 and 2007. To date, consumers appear to be managing changes in their mortgage payments quite well.  One area of potential concern relates to the portion of home sales accounted for by investors, as opposed to owner-occupants. Historically, only around 5 percent of U.S. homes were purchased each year by investors; in 2005, it appears that figure was considerably higher. In many cases, investors purchased homes because they believed prices were going to rise further, not necessarily because they wanted to retain the property over time for rental income. As prices level off or even decline, it will be important to see whether this investor activity subsides significantly, and if so, the impact on mortgage markets more broadly. Commercial real estate markets In addition to monitoring residential markets, the Federal Reserve keeps a close watch on developments in commercial real estate markets. Overall, conditions in this sector appear to be improving. Demand for commercial space has been growing moderately, while the construction of new space has generally remained tame, restrained in part by steep land prices and high construction costs. The result has been a widespread decline in vacancy rates over the past few years. Reflecting this improved balance between demand and supply, rents on commercial properties have been increasing after a prolonged period of softness. Although the level of commercial construction remains well below its peak in 2000, the latest data indicate what may be the beginning of a pickup. Census Bureau data on nonresidential construction put in place suggest that real spending rose in April for the sixth consecutive month. Leading indicators of commercial construction spending, such as billings by architectural firms for design work, point to further increases in activity in coming months. An upturn in commercial construction could offset part of what is anticipated to be a waning contribution to GDP growth from the housing sector. The performance of commercial real estate loans has generally been very good, due in large part to the low interest rates of recent years and the substantial appreciation of property values that has resulted in sizable equity positions for building owners. Delinquency rates on loans held by commercial banks and life insurance companies remain low by historical standards, and delinquencies on commercial mortgage-backed securities have reversed the modest increase that occurred from 2000 to 2003. The latest information on property prices hints at some moderation in price increases in the first quarter from the rapid price appreciation of last year. But, as in the housing market, commercial real estate prices are continuing to rise in the aggregate.  Recent supervisory guidance relating to real estate lending The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments in the residential and commercial real estate markets very closely. In addition to scrutinizing the effect of these developments on the economy, we are also, in our role as bank supervisors, monitoring banks' mortgage lending practices. Last year, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued draft guidance on both residential and commercial mortgage lending. The agencies have received many comments on the proposed guidance, including comments from your association, which we will consider as we discuss what steps to take next. I will address the guidance on residential mortgage lending first.  2 BIS Review 57/2006 
Nontraditional mortgage products Over the past few years, the agencies have observed an increase in the number of residential mortgage loans that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal and, sometimes, interest. These loans, often referred to as nontraditional mortgage loans, include interest-only (IO) mortgage loans, for which the borrower pays no loan principal for the first few years of the loan, and payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), for which the borrower has flexible payment options - and which could result in negative amortization. IOs and option ARMs are estimated to have accounted for almost one-third of all U.S. mortgage originations in 2005, compared with fewer than 10 percent in 2003. Despite their recent growth, however, it is estimated that these products still account for less than 20 percent of aggregate domestic mortgages outstanding of nearly $9 trillion. Although the credit quality of residential mortgages generally remains strong, the Federal Reserve and the other banking supervisors are concerned that banks' current risk-management techniques may not fully address the level of risk inherent in nontraditional mortgages, a risk that would be heightened by a downturn in the housing market.  Mortgages with some of the characteristics of nontraditional mortgage products have been available for many years; however, they have historically been offered to higher-income borrowers. More recently, nontraditional mortgages have been offered to a wider spectrum of consumers, including subprime borrowers, who may be less suited for these types of mortgages and may not fully recognize their embedded risks. These borrowers are more likely to experience an unmanageable payment shock during the life of the loan, meaning that they may be more likely to default on the loan. Further, nontraditional mortgage loans are becoming more prevalent in the subprime market at the same time risk tolerances in the capital markets have increased. Banks need to be prepared for the resulting impact on liquidity and pricing if and when risk spreads return to more "normal" levels and competition in the mortgage banking industry intensifies. Supervisors have also observed that lenders are increasingly combining nontraditional mortgage loans with weaker mitigating controls on credit exposures - for example, by accepting less documentation in evaluating an applicant's creditworthiness and not evaluating the borrower's ability to meet increasing monthly payments when amortization begins or when interest rates rise. These "risk layering" practices have become more and more prevalent in mortgage originations. Thus, although some banks may have used some elements of nontraditional mortgage products successfully in the past, the recent easing of traditional underwriting controls and the sale of nontraditional products to subprime borrowers may contribute to losses on these products. Supervisors are concerned that banks may not be fully aware of the potential risks of using risk-layering practices with nontraditional mortgage products. These practices may have become more widespread over the past couple of years as competition for borrowers and declining profit margins may have forced lenders to loosen their credit standards to maintain their loan volume. In the Federal Reserve Board's most recent Senior Loan Officer Survey, conducted this past April, more than 10 percent of the surveyed institutions reported having eased their underwriting standards for residential mortgage loans. Only one of the surveyed lenders reported having tightened standards. Additionally, information from other sources seems to show continued growth in the number of borrowers purchasing real estate with no equity using simultaneous second liens. Naturally, we are watching for any signs that defaults may be on the rise. Some industry evidence indicates that delinquencies may be on the uptick; delinquency rates for loans issued in 2005 are, in most cases, higher than those for comparable loans issued in earlier years. Some industry observers believe that the increase in delinquencies for loans issued in 2005 is directly related to the continued easing of underwriting standards and the increased use of risk-layering practices. The industry trends I have just described, taken together, were the justification for the issuance of draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products by the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies. The proposed guidance emphasizes that an institution's risk-management processes should allow it to adequately identify, measure, monitor, and control the risk associated with these products. It reminds lenders of the importance of assessing a borrower's ability to repay the loan, both now and when amortization begins and interest rates rise. Nontraditional mortgage products warrant a bank having strong risk-management standards as well as appropriate capital and loan-loss reserves. Further, bankers should consider the impact of prepayment penalties for ARMs. Lenders should provide enough information so that borrowers clearly understand, before choosing a product or payment option, the terms of and risks associated with these loans, particularly the extent to which BIS Review 57/2006 3 
monthly payments may rise and negative amortization may increase the amount owed above the amount originally borrowed. Lenders should recognize that certain nontraditional mortgage loans are untested in a stressed environment; for instance, nontraditional mortgage loans to investors that rely on collateral values could be particularly affected by a housing-price decline. As noted, investors have represented an unusually large share of recent home purchases. Past loan performance has indicated that investors are more likely than owner-occupants to default on a loan when housing prices decline.  When credit standards are eased and risks are layered, institutions should compensate for the increased risk with mitigating factors that support the underwriting decision. Among other credit enhancements, these factors generally include requiring borrowers to have higher credit scores, lower loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, and significant liquidity and net worth. Finally, lenders should establish appropriate allowances for estimated credit losses in their nontraditional mortgage portfolios and hold capital commensurate with the risk characteristics inherent in these products. One final subject that is not addressed explicitly in our draft guidance, but that I believe is still important to supervisors and bankers, is mortgage fraud. There appears to have been a substantial upswing in suspected fraud related to residential mortgages in the past decade. Types of fraud include falsification of loan applications, identity theft, misuse of loan proceeds, and inflated appraisals. According to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, there were more than 18,000 reports of suspected mortgage fraud in 2004 (the latest year for which we have complete data), compared with fewer than 2,000 reports in 1997. And in the first six months of 2005 alone, there were more than 11,000 reports of suspected mortgage fraud. The increase may be attributable in part to an increase in the number of originators required to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs). Notably, the more widespread use of nontraditional loan products may present greater opportunity for fraud, as these products sometimes lack some of the quality checks typical of more-traditional mortgages. In general, we consider mortgage fraud to be a serious issue and one that bankers and supervisors must continue to confront. Of course, supervisors want to hear the industry's perspective on fraud in mortgage lending.  Commercial real estate The U.S. banking agencies recently issued proposed guidance on commercial real estate (CRE) lending. A major portion of that guidance focuses on CRE concentrations.  Before I discuss the importance of managing CRE concentrations, I want to emphasize that the proposed CRE guidance relates to "true" CRE loans. It is not directed at commercial loans for which a bank looks to a business's cash flow as the source of repayment and accepts real estate collateral as a secondary source of repayment. The proposed guidance addresses bank loans for commercial real estate projects for which repayment depends on third-party rental income or on the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The latter are "true" commercial real estate loans, in that repayment depends on the condition and performance of the real estate market. I also want to mention up front that the proposed guidance is not intended to cap or restrict banks' participation in the CRE sector but rather to remind institutions that proper risk management and appropriate capital are essential elements of a sound CRE lending strategy. In fact, many institutions already have both of these elements in place and may not need to adjust their practices very much.  I believe we are all aware of the central role that CRE lending played in the banking problems of the late 1980s and early 1990s. One reason supervisors are proposing CRE guidance at this point is that we are seeing high and rising concentrations of CRE loans relative to capital. For certain groups of banks, such as those with assets of between $100 million and $1 billion, the average CRE concentration level is about 300 percent of total capital. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the concentration level for this same bank group was about 150 percent, or half the current level. Therefore, banks should not be surprised by the emphasis in the proposed CRE guidance on concentrations and the importance of portfolio risk management.  Historically, CRE has been a highly volatile asset class. In the past, problems in CRE, even at well-managed banks, have generally come at times when the broader market was encountering difficulties. In an effort to generate cash flow, borrowers and bankers with properties in distress may disrupt their local real estate market by cutting rents or offering leasehold improvements and other incentives to attract or keep tenants. These actions can have a negative effect on the entire local real estate market, including good projects. In most years, CRE credit losses are relatively low compared with many other types of bank loans. But in times of stress, the loss rate can jump considerably higher. 4 BIS Review 57/2006 
Because CRE losses tend to be greater during times of stress, bankers must focus more intently on their risk appetite as their CRE concentration grows. Bankers must consider how much capital will be placed at risk if the CRE portfolio hits a stress period and compare that loss exposure with the relative returns of CRE lending. In other words, bankers need to practice risk management. While banks' underwriting standards are generally stronger than they were in the 1980s and 1990s, the agencies are proposing the guidance now to reinforce sound portfolio-management principles that a bank should have in place when pursuing a commercial real estate lending strategy. A bank should be monitoring performance both on an individual-loan basis as well as on a collective basis for loans collateralized by similar property types or in the same markets.  Some institutions' strategic- and capital-planning processes may not adequately acknowledge the risks from their CRE concentrations. CRE lending in recent years has occurred under fairly benign credit conditions, but those conditions are unlikely to continue indefinitely. The ability of banks with significant concentrations to weather difficult market conditions will depend heavily on their risk-management processes and their level of capitalization. From a risk-management and capital perspective, institutions should generally focus on the emerging conditions in their real estate markets and on the potential cumulative impact on their portfolios if conditions deteriorate; they should also take other measures to help identify CRE vulnerabilities. Of course, these measures should vary according to the size of the organization and the level of the concentration. All of these steps are key elements of a sound strategy to manage concentrations.  While supervisors continue to underscore the importance of having robust risk-management practices for CRE and other lending concentrations, we do acknowledge that banks may pursue a variety of approaches. In some cases, such as when there is not enough market data available or the relevant geographic market is small, banks may have to turn to less- quantitative approaches. Nonetheless, those approaches should be robust, well documented, and transparent. This is consistent with the broader theme that risk management should be scaled to the institution. Along those same lines, we are not necessarily expecting smaller banks to be able to conduct regular, extensive, and sophisticated quantitative stress tests around their lending concentrations. However, we do want bankers at smaller organizations to have clear and coherent methods for evaluating the various potential outcomes associated with their CRE concentrations and with all their exposures more broadly.  Conclusion In the past several decades, real estate markets, both residential and commercial, have affected the U.S. economy in both negative and positive ways. Naturally, the Federal Reserve monitors these markets to gauge their impact on broader economic activity. In addition, because banks are substantially involved in both residential and commercial real estate markets, as a supervisor, we must ensure that bank lending in these markets is conducted in a safe and sound manner.  One tool we use to help maintain the safety and soundness of banks is supervisory guidance, which can point out areas requiring additional monitoring, suggest ways in which banks can improve risk management, and remind bankers that they should continue to exercise discipline in their lending activities to ensure that they are accounting for all their risks. The recently issued draft guidance on nontraditional mortgage products and on CRE lending, as I have noted, is not an attempt to stifle lending in these sectors, which, if conducted properly, can continue to be profitable businesses for bankers. Indeed, we recognize the important role that banks play in real estate lending. That is why we want to ensure that banks maintain good practices when operating in those markets.  As a final point, if both sets of guidance are finalized, we aim to implement them as consistently as possible across institutions. We do understand bankers' concerns about this issue. Of course, it is always a challenge to ensure that there is consistent application of guidance throughout the industry, especially when bank-specific factors - such as portfolio concentrations and individual risk-management practices - might affect the manner in which the guidance needs to be applied to each bank. But if the guidance is indeed finalized, we plan to undertake considerable efforts across our agencies, including extensive communication and coordination, so that banks are not subject to needlessly differing treatment.

Ben S Bernanke: Energy and the economy  Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Economic Club of Chicago, Chicago, 15 June 2006. *      *      * In my remarks today, I would like to discuss the relationship between energy markets and the economy. As I am certain all of you are aware, the steep increases in energy prices over the past several years have had significant consequences for households, businesses, and economic policy. At least since the time of the first oil shock in October 1973, economists have struggled to understand the ways that disturbances to the supply and demand balance in energy markets influence economic growth and inflation. At the most basic level, oil and natural gas are just primary commodities, like tin, rubber, or iron ore. Yet energy commodities are special, in part because they are critical inputs to a very wide variety of production processes of modern economies. They provide the fuel that drives our transportation system, heats our homes and offices, and powers our factories. Moreover, energy has an influence that is disproportionate to its share in real gross domestic product (GDP) largely because of our limited ability to adjust the amount of energy we use per unit of output over short periods of time. Over longer periods, energy consumption can be altered more easily by, for example, adjusting the types of vehicles that we drive, the kind of homes that we build, and the variety of machines that we buy. Those decisions, in turn, influence the growth and composition of the stock of capital and the productive capacity of the economy. Over the past thirty-five years, the U.S. economy has experienced some wide swings in energy prices. The oil price increases of the 1970s were followed by price declines in the mid-1980s and then a price spike in 1990, with numerous fluctuations since then. From the mid-1980s until fairly recently, market participants tended to look through these price cycles and did not allow their longer-term expectations for oil prices to be greatly affected by short-run swings in spot prices. But beginning around 2003, futures prices began moving up roughly in line with the rise in spot prices. Thus, unlike in earlier episodes, the significantly higher relative price of energy that we are now experiencing is expected to be relatively long lasting and thus will likely prompt more-significant adjustments by households and businesses over time. This higher relative price of energy poses many important questions for economists and policymakers. Why have the prices of oil and natural gas risen so much? What is the outlook for energy supplies and prices in the medium term and in the long term? And what implications does the behavior of energy prices have for the ongoing economic expansion and inflation? I will touch briefly on each of these questions.  Developments in oil markets Let me begin with the market for crude oil. What accounts for the behavior of the current and expected future prices of petroleum? Supply and demand are among the most valuable concepts in the economist's toolkit, and I believe they are the key to understanding recent and prospective developments in oil markets. For the most part, high oil prices reflect high and growing demand for oil and limited and uncertain supplies.  On the demand side, world oil consumption surged 4 percent in 2004 after rising a solid 2 percent in 2003. The rise in 2004 was much larger than had been expected and was, in fact, the largest yearly increase in a quarter-century. A significant part of the unexpected increase in oil consumption that year reflected rapidly growing oil use in the United States and East Asia, notably China. In 2005, growth of world oil consumption slowed to 1.3 percent, partly reflecting the restraining effects of higher prices. Nonetheless, the level of oil consumption was still high relative to earlier expectations. Thus far this year, underlying demand pressures have remained strong in the context of a global economy that has continued to expand robustly.  On the supply side, the production of oil has been constrained by available capacity, hurricanes, and geopolitical developments. In 2003 and 2004, as oil consumption and prices rose briskly, Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pumped more oil. OPEC was able to boost production relatively quickly in response to changing market conditions by utilizing productive capacity that had been idle. By the end of 2004, however, OPEC's spare BIS Review 56/2006  1
production capacity was greatly diminished. As a consequence, OPEC's oil production flattened out over the past year even as oil prices continued to soar. Oil production outside OPEC also leveled off last year, contrary to earlier expectations for continued growth. This development in part reflected the devastating effects of last year's hurricanes. Katrina and Rita were enormously disruptive for our nation's production of energy. At the worst point, 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil were shut in, virtually all of the U.S. production in the Gulf of Mexico and nearly 2 percent of global oil production. Recovery of oil production in the Gulf has been slow, and the disruptions from last year's storms linger even as we enter this year's hurricane season. The cumulative loss in oil production attributable to Katrina and Rita amounts to more than 160 million barrels of oil, a figure equivalent to nearly half the present level of commercial crude oil inventories in the United States.  With the background of strong demand and limited spare capacity, both actual production disruptions and concerns about the reliability and security of future oil supplies have contributed to the volatility in oil prices. The oil-rich Middle East remains an especially unsettled region of the world, but political risks to the oil supply have also emerged in nations outside the Middle East, including Russia, Venezuela, and Nigeria.  Compounding these difficulties in markets for crude oil have been constraints and disruptions in the refining sector of the energy industry. In the wake of Hurricane Rita, one-quarter of domestic refining capacity was offline, and here, too, the period of recovery has been protracted. Even before last year's hurricanes, however, a mismatch appeared to be emerging between the incremental supply of crude oil, which tended to be heavy and sulfurous, and the demand by refiners for light, sweet crude, which can be converted more easily into clean-burning transportation fuels. These developments have highlighted the need for additional investments in refining capacity to bridge the gap between upstream supply and final demand.  What about the longer term? We can safely assume that world economic growth, together with the rapid pace of industrialization in China, India, and other emerging-market economies, will generate increasing demand for oil and other forms of energy. In all likelihood, growth in the demand for energy will be tempered to some extent by continued improvements in energy efficiency which, in turn, will be stimulated by higher prices and ongoing concerns about the security of oil supplies. Such improvements are possible even without technological breakthroughs. For example, Japan is an advanced industrial nation that uses only about one-half as much energy to produce a dollar's worth of real output as the United States does. Of course, the Japanese and U.S. economies differ in important ways, but the comparison nevertheless suggests that there is scope to boost energy efficiency in the United States and other parts of the industrialized world. Newly industrializing economies such as China appear to be quite inefficient in their use of energy; but as they modernize, they can adopt energy-saving techniques already in use elsewhere, and their energy efficiency will presumably improve as well. Still, as the global economic expansion continues, substantial growth in the use of oil and other energy sources appears to be inevitable. How readily the supply side of the oil market will respond is difficult to predict. In a physical sense, the world is not in imminent danger of running out of oil. At the end of 2005, the world's proved reserves of conventional oil - that is, oil in the ground that is viewed as recoverable using existing technologies and under current economic conditions - stood at more than 1.2 trillion barrels, about 15 percent higher than the world's proved reserves a decade earlier and equal to about four decades of global consumption at current rates. These figures do not include Canada's vast deposits of oil sands, which are estimated to contain an additional 174 billion barrels of proved reserves. In addition, today's proved reserve figures ignore not only the potential for new discoveries but also the likelihood that improved technologies and higher oil prices will increase the amount of oil that can be economically recovered. The oil is there, but whether substantial new sources of production can be made available over the next five years or so is in some doubt. Some important fields are in locations that are technically difficult and time-consuming to develop, such as deep-water fields off the coast of West Africa, in the Gulf of Mexico, or off the east coast of South America. In many cases, the development of new fields also faces the challenge of recovering the oil without damaging delicate ecosystems. Perhaps most troubling are the significant uncertainties generated by geopolitical instability, as I have already noted. Much of the world's oil reserves are located in areas where political turmoil and violence have restrained both production and investment.  BIS Review 56/2006 2 
In both the developed and the developing world, another factor holding back investment in oil infrastructure has been concern on the part of producers that oil prices might fall back as they did in the 1980s and 1990s. In light of that recognition, some oil producers have been reluctant to launch exploration projects even with today's high prices. Such concerns have been reinforced by the huge reserves of oil in several OPEC countries that could be extracted at very low cost if sufficient resources and expertise were directed toward doing so. Developments in the natural gas market The story for natural gas shares some similarities with the story for oil, but there are important differences as well. In the 1990s, the U.S. spot price of natural gas at the Henry Hub averaged about $2 per million Btu. However, in recent years, the United States has seen a marked increase in the price of natural gas. The average spot price climbed to nearly $9 per million Btu in 2005, with the price spiking to $15 per million Btu following hurricanes Katrina and Rita. So far this year, natural gas prices have fallen back to around $7 per million Btu as an unusually warm winter curtailed consumption and boosted natural gas in storage to record levels. Futures markets currently anticipate that the price of natural gas will be about $9 per million Btu next year. Why have natural gas prices risen so sharply over the past few years, and why are they expected to remain elevated? As with oil, high prices of natural gas reflect strong demand and diminished supplies. Unlike the globally integrated market for oil, however, natural gas markets are regional, primarily because of the difficulty in transporting gas by means other than pipelines. Although the world's capacity to trade liquefied natural gas, which is transported by ships, is growing, it is still a small fraction of world supply and is not yet sufficient to fully integrate natural gas markets across continents. Demand for natural gas in North America has remained strong in recent years, particularly as environmental concerns have led clean-burning natural gas to become the fuel of choice for new electricity generation. Moreover, increases in oil prices have boosted the demand for energy substitutes such as natural gas. However, domestic production of natural gas has not kept up. Last year, U.S. production was 7 percent below its 2001 level, with less than half of that decline reflecting the impact of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Increased trade can often mitigate price increases, but net imports of natural gas from Canada, which currently account for around 16 percent of U.S. consumption, have failed to increase in response to higher prices. Between 1988 and 2001, net imports from Canada tripled, but they have since flattened out. Both U.S. and Canadian gas fields have matured and are yielding smaller increases in output, despite the incentive of high prices and a substantial increase in the number of drilling rigs in operation. Trade in liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is also likely to increase over time, but perhaps at a slower pace than once envisioned. LNG imports into the United States nearly tripled from 2002 to 2004, but they actually fell a bit last year as production disruptions in a number of countries limited supply and as consumers in other countries competed for available cargoes. Thus, natural gas prices are likely to remain elevated for at least the coming few years. It is possible, however, that within a decade new supplies from previously untapped areas of North America could boost available output here, while imports of LNG will increase to more substantial levels as countries seek to bring their isolated natural gas reserves to market. Given time, these developments could serve to lower natural gas prices in the United States significantly. Nonetheless, because of the higher costs of producing these supplies relative to the traditional sources of natural gas, as well as the elevated cost of other energy sources such as oil, natural gas prices seem unlikely to return to the level of the 1990s. Thus, the supply-demand fundamentals seem consistent with the view now taken by market participants that the days of persistently cheap oil and natural gas are likely behind us. The good news is that, in the longer run, we have options. I have already noted the scope for improvements in energy efficiency and increased conservation. Considerable potential exists as well for substituting other energy sources for oil and natural gas, including coal, nuclear energy, and renewable sources such as bio-fuels and wind power. Given enough time, market mechanisms are likely to increase energy supplies, including alternative energy sources, while simultaneously encouraging conservation and substitution away from oil and natural gas to other types of energy.  BIS Review 56/2006  3
Economic and policy implications of increased energy prices What are the economic implications of the higher energy prices that we are experiencing? In the long run, higher energy prices are likely to reduce somewhat the productive capacity of the U.S. economy. That outcome would occur, for example, if high energy costs make businesses less willing to invest in new capital or cause some existing capital to become economically obsolete. All else being equal, these effects tend to restrain the growth of labor productivity, which in turn implies that real wages and profits will be lower than they otherwise would have been. Also, the higher cost of imported oil is likely to adversely affect our terms of trade; that is, Americans will have to sell more goods and services abroad to pay for a given quantity of oil and other imports. For the medium term at least, the higher bill for oil imports will increase the U.S. current account deficit, implying a greater need for foreign financing. Under the assumption that energy prices do not move sharply higher from their already high levels, these long-run effects, though clearly negative, appear to be manageable. The U.S. economy is remarkably flexible, and it seems to have absorbed the cost shocks of the past few years with only a few dislocations. And conservation and the development of alternative energy sources will, over the long term, ameliorate some of the effects of higher energy prices. Moreover, ongoing productivity gains arising from sources such as technological improvements are likely to exceed by a significant margin the productivity losses created by high energy prices. In the short run, sharply higher energy prices create a rather different and, in some ways, a more difficult set of economic challenges. Indeed, a significant increase in energy prices can simultaneously slow economic growth while raising inflation. An increase in oil prices slows economic growth in the short run primarily through its effects on consumer spending. Because the United States imports much of the oil that it consumes, an increase in oil prices is, as many economists have noted, broadly analogous to the imposition of a tax on U.S. residents, with the revenue from the tax going to oil producers abroad. In 2004 as a whole, the total cost of imported oil increased almost $50 billion relative to 2003. The imported oil bill jumped again last year by an additional $70 billion, and given the price increases we have experienced in 2006, it appears on track to increase $50 billion further at an annual rate in the first half of this year. Coupled with the rising cost of imported natural gas, the cumulative increase in imported energy costs since the end of 2003 is shaping up to be $185 billion - equal to almost 1-1/2 percent of GDP. All else being equal, this constitutes a noticeable drag on real household incomes and spending. It is a tribute to the underlying strength and resiliency of the U.S. economy that it has been able to perform well despite the drag from increased energy prices. At the same time that higher oil prices slow economic growth, they also create inflationary pressures. Higher prices for crude oil are passed through to increased prices for the refined products used by consumers, such as gasoline and heating oil. When oil prices rise, people may try to substitute other forms of energy, such as natural gas, leading to price increases in those alternatives as well. The rise in prices paid by households for energy - for example for gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas - represent, of course, an increase in the cost of living and in price inflation. This direct effect of higher energy prices on the cost of living is sometimes called the first-round effect on inflation. In addition, higher energy costs may have indirect effects on the inflation rate - if, for example, firms pass on their increased costs of production in the form of higher consumer prices for non-energy goods or services or if workers respond to the increase in the cost of living by demanding higher nominal wages. A jump in energy costs could also increase the public's longer-term inflation expectations, a factor that would put additional upward pressure on inflation. These indirect effects of higher energy prices on the overall rate of inflation are called second-round effects. The overall inflation rate reflects both first-round and second-round effects. Economists and policymakers also pay attention to the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the direct effects of increases in the prices of energy (as well as of food). By stripping out the first-round inflation effects, core inflation provides a useful indicator of the second-round effects of increases in the price of energy. In the past, notably during the 1970s and early 1980s, both the first-round and second-round effects of oil-price increases on inflation tended to be large, as firms freely passed on rising energy costs to consumers, workers reacted to the surging cost of living by ratcheting up their wage demands, and longer-run expectations of inflation moved up quickly. In this situation, monetary policymaking was extremely difficult because oil-price increases threatened to result in a large and persistent increase in the overall inflation rate. The Federal Reserve attempted to contain the inflationary effects of the oil- BIS Review 56/2006 4 
price shocks by engineering sharp increases in interest rates, actions which had the consequence of sharply slowing growth and raising unemployment, as in the recessions that began in 1973 and 1981. Since about 1980, however, the Federal Reserve and most other central banks have worked hard to bring inflation and expectations of inflation down. An important benefit of these efforts is that the second-round inflation effect of a given increase in energy prices has been much reduced. To the extent that households and business owners expect that the Fed will keep inflation low, firms have both less incentive and less ability to pass on increased energy costs in the form of higher prices, and likewise workers have less incentive to demand compensating increases in their nominal wages. As I noted in remarks last week, although the rate of pass-through of higher energy and other commodity prices to core consumer price inflation appears to have remained relatively low in the current episode - reflecting the inflation-fighting credibility built by the Fed in recent decades the cumulative increases in energy and commodity prices have been large enough that they could account for some of the recent pickup in core inflation. In addition, some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged up, on net, in recent months, as has the compensation for inflation and inflation risk implied by yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt. As yet, these expectations measures have remained within the ranges in which they have fluctuated in recent years and inflation compensation implied by yields on government debt has fallen back somewhat in the past month. Nevertheless, these developments bear watching. In conclusion, energy prices have moved up considerably since the end of 2002, reflecting supply and demand factors. In the short run, prices are likely to remain high in an environment of strong world economic growth and a limited ability to increase energy supplies. Moreover, prices are likely to be volatile in the near term, given the small margins of excess capacity to produce crude oil or natural gas that traditionally have buffered short-run shifts in supply and demand.  However, in the long run, market forces will respond. The higher relative prices of energy will create incentives for businesses to create new, energy-saving technologies and for energy consumers to adopt them. The market for alternative fuels is growing rapidly and will help to shift consumption away from petroleum-based fuels. Government can contribute to these conservation efforts by working to create a regulatory environment that encourages the growth in energy supplies in a manner that is consistent with our nation's environmental and other objectives. Given the extraordinary resilience of the U.S. economy, I am confident our nation will be up to this challenge.  BIS Review 56/2006  5
Y V Reddy: Global imbalances - an Indian perspective Keynote address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Financing for Development (FFD) Office, Department of Economic and Social Office (DESA), United Nations, New York, 11 May 2006. *      *      * Honourable Under Secretary General, Mr. Ocampo, Ambassador Nirupam Sen and Distinguished Guests, It is a privilege and an honor to be invited at the United Nations to deliver a talk on 'Global Imbalances: an Indian Perspective". I would like to thank Professor Jose Antonio Ocampo, Under Secretary General, for inviting me to deliver this talk. In my presentation today, I hope to capture the debate among the policy makers as well as academics; though I must be humble in the presence of Mr. Ocampo who has been a Minister, and a Professor and currently international civil servant of eminence. To benefit from the discussions that are expected to follow, I will restrict my presentation to about 30 to 40 minutes. First, I would like to reflect upon the international perspective on global imbalances by raising three issues: (a) the essential features of the global imbalances as they stand today, (b) possible causes of these imbalances, and (c) the emerging consensus on policy responses. Second, I will attempt to highlight India’s perspective on the global imbalances. While doing so, I would try to cover the following aspects: (a) India’s role in global imbalances, (b) approach to global consensus on causes and policy responses, (c) possible impact of global imbalances on India, and (d) the emergence of oil as a new factor in the policy debate on global imbalances. Third, I shall explore a possible agenda for analysis to enable better understanding of global imbalances.  I. Global perspective on global imbalances (a) Essential feature of the global imbalances It is useful to understand that in different countries the existence of a current account surplus or deficit is inevitable among economies at any given time. In particular, one of the arguments in favor of global integration is that capital may flow from developed economies to the capital starved developing economies which implies that there would be current account deficits in the latter. The problem is not the existence of current account deficits or surpluses per se, but it is persistence of large current account deficit and large current account surplus, particularly in large and systemically important economies, which give rise to fears of unsustainabilty and disruptive unwinding. (b) Possible causes of global imbalances The current global imbalance is reflected in large mismatches in the current account positions in some countries and its mirror image in the form of domestic saving-investment mismatches. For instance, the US current account deficit was 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2005 and stood at US $805 billion. While the current account surplus of Japan and emerging Asia accounted for about 60 per cent of the current account deficit of the US. Now, with rising oil prices, the oil exporting countries also exhibit large current account surpluses.  It is argued by some that since the late 1990s, the growth processes in many emerging market economies (EMEs), especially those from Asia, have come to rely heavily on external demand. Under such a scenario, it has been felt, many of these countries tried to maintain their external price competitiveness by keeping their currencies undervalued. The process, it is stated, in turn, led to large trade and current account surplus for the Asian EMEs and large trade and current deficits elsewhere in the world, most noticeably in the US.  It is also clear that the sharp deterioration in the saving-investment balance in the US in the recent years along with sustained rise in consumption demand, could only be met by rising imports; hence BIS Review 56/2006  1
rising large current account deficits in the US. The adverse shift in saving-investment balance in the US is reflected both in the high budget deficit since 2002 and the deterioration in net personal saving since 1998.  (c) The emerging consensus on policy responses The global imbalance as it stands today may get corrected on its own and perhaps there could be chances of a less favorable outcome of disorderly correction. It is held that one scenario could be that an orderly private sector led adjustment in imbalances could materialize even without policy action. It is argued that, however slim the chances of a disorderly adjustment, in view of huge cost of disorderly adjustments, public policy cannot afford but strive for relatively orderly adjustment. In any case, it is felt that there is a need for better understanding of policy issues with a view to take appropriate policy actions as also to minimize the cost of adjustments if it were to take place in not very orderly fashion. We have viewed, like many others here, that the sustained and increasing imbalances in the current account positions across the globe could entail serious risks for the functioning of the international monetary system. Rebalancing is best seen as a process with many moving parts that involve all the major actors in the global economy. The successful execution of rebalancing will require a careful application of traditional macro policies - monetary, fiscal, and currency policies - as well as implementation of comprehensive micro agenda of structural reforms. A significant part of the debate seems to be on relative weights to be accorded by each country to the various elements of the package and the aspects of coordination among the countries that are appropriate. As regards the current global initiatives to correct global imbalances, the Communiqué issued by the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC) released on April 22, 2006 highlights that action for orderly medium-term resolution of global imbalances is a shared responsibility, and will bring greater benefit to members and the international community than actions taken individually by countries. Key elements of the strategy towards orderly resolution of the global imbalance suggested in the Communiqué are as follows: • Raising national saving in the United States - with measures to reduce the budget deficit and spur private saving;  • Implementing structural reforms to sustain growth potential and boost domestic demand in the euro area and several other countries; • Further structural reforms, including fiscal consolidation, in Japan;  • Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility in a number of surplus countries in emerging Asia; and, • Promoting efficient absorption of higher oil revenues in oil-exporting countries with strong macroeconomic policies. In the light of the above, the adjustments that are generally advocated in the individual economies and regions may be summarized as follows: i. A major challenge for US authorities could be to seek policies that balance between measures to boost personal saving coupled with measures to cut consumption. However, US policies would need to delicately balance a gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus without hurting the recovery. It should be noted that demand compression could result in another recession, which would not be in the interest of the global economy. A gradual realignment of the real exchange rate of the US dollar coupled with measures targeted towards fiscal consolidation is generally advocated. Having said that, proper calibration would hold the key to the success of such a policy mix and this is an important public policy issue. ii. The Euro area, which continues to depend largely on external demand, could pursue some structural reforms, especially product and labor market policies, to boost domestic demand and broad-base the recovery. While there are signs of recovery in investment, it is recognized by many that further progress would be helpful to foster better integration of labor, health care, product, pension and financial market reforms. It is recognized that structural reforms by their nature are complex and their impact at best could be only over the medium term. iii. We are already witnessing that the Japanese economy is on the way to recovery; the current account surplus has begun to narrow against the background of strengthening domestic  BIS Review 56/2006 2 
demand, which is critical. Thus, the Japanese economy is expected to continue to take some concrete measures to strengthen its financial system, restructure the corporate sector, and reduce large fiscal imbalances.  iv. As for the emerging economies, especially in Asia, some experts suggest that the growth strategy could be reoriented towards domestic demand to offset possible declines in exports to the US. There are already some signs of strengthening in domestic demand in this region. It is felt that improvement in the investment climate to support higher private investment in the emerging economies is important. It is argued by some that the exchange rate policy may require some attention of the policy makers in the region. However, some others consider that exchange rate adjustments may not serve the interests of output and employment in these countries, while effectiveness of such exchange rate adjustments by themselves in unwinding the imbalances is not conclusive. v. The oil exporting countries have recorded large trade surpluses, the investment of which in the domestic market and abroad would help rebalancing global demand. It is suggested that these countries could boost expenditures to some extent in areas where social returns are high like education, health, infrastructure and social security. It is felt that structural policies to strengthen legal and economic infrastructure in these countries may help promoting investment. However, it is also argued that in many oil exporting countries scope for domestic absorption is limited in the short run.  II. India’s perspective on global imbalances  (a) India’s role in global imbalances Since Independence, India has moved from a moderate growth path of the first three decades (1950 to 1980) to a higher growth trajectory since the 1980s. Over the last two and a half decades, India has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies of the world, averaging about 6 per cent growth rate per annum and the ranking of the country in terms of size of the economy, especially in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms, has improved. In the last three years, we have averaged a growth rate of 8 per cent. Apart from registering impressive growth rate over the last two and a half decades, India’s growth process has been stable. Studies indicate that the yearly variation in growth in India has been one of the lowest. During this period, we have faced only one crisis in 1991. The crisis was followed by a credible macroeconomic structural and stabilization programme encompassing trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance and the financial sector. The Indian economy in later years, could successfully avoid any adverse contagion impact of shocks from the East Asian crisis, the Russian crisis during 1997-98, sanction like situation in post-Pokhran scenario, and border conflict during May-June 1999. In this context, it is appropriate to view the evidence that the policies followed by India have not in any way contributed to the widening of the current global imbalances: (i) Between 2001-02 and 2003-04, India registered modest current account surpluses, but this was more of a reflection of phase of business cycle, and with the turn around in the business cycle, India has registered a modest current account deficit in the last two years. In fact, going by the current indication and the projections of the tenth Five Year Plan, India is likely to maintain a modest and sustainable current account deficit in the near future.  (ii) It is observed that generally current account surplus accounted for a considerable proportion of reserve accumulation in most of the Asian EMEs and Japan during 2000-05. For India, current account surplus has been a minor source of reserve accretion. In our case, capital flows, as opposed to current account surpluses, played an increasingly important role in the accumulation of reserves.  (iii) Our approach aimed at market determined exchange rate with no predetermined target along with market interventions essentially to manage volatility has served us well. At the empirical level, the flexibility of Indian exchange rate policy is captured by marked two-way movement of Indian rupee against the major currencies including US dollar. Recent international research on viable exchange rate strategies in emerging markets has lent considerable support to the exchange rate policy followed by India. BIS Review 56/2006  3
(iv) The main driver of growth in India has been domestic demand. Impressive growth in exports and imports does strengthen the economy but the ratio of exports to GDP in India is lower than most EMEs.  (v) The overall improvement in GDP growth during the reform period has also been facilitated by improvement in the rate of aggregate domestic saving. For instance, in the high growth phase of last three years, the saving rate rose by 5.5 percentage points from 23.5 per cent in 2001-02 to 29.1 per cent in 2004-05. Gross domestic investment rate, for the first time, remained above 30 per cent in 2004-05, mainly on account of private investment growing at 19.7 per cent. With the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act in place, the fiscal situation in India has shown improvement in the recent years. The fiscal consolidation process envisages phased reduction in the key deficit indicators. Monetary policy, while being supportive of investment demand places emphasis on price and financial stability and has succeeded in containing inflation expectations. These factors give confidence to the possibility of sustaining the present growth momentum – GDP growth of close to 8 per cent per annum. India has, thus, been following policies which not only served it well but also contributed to global stability. As mentioned by our Finance Minister, Mr. P. Chidambaram, we do not expect any change in the basic framework of our policies both in terms of growth based on efficient use of capital and stability assured by sound macroeconomic policies. (b) Approach to global consensus on causes and policy responses We view that global developments, particularly those in the world financial markets, have the most direct and serious impact on the financing conditions in the emerging markets. Any abrupt and disorderly adjustment to global imbalances may have serious adverse implications. Recognising these developments, Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh in his welcome address to the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) at the 39th Annual General Meeting in Hyderabad, a couple of weeks ago, highlighted the importance of correcting these imbalances. I quote from his address: “While to some extent mismatches in current account positions are to be expected - and even desirable - in the global economy, large disparities raise concerns about unsustainability and hard landings. The process of correcting imbalances can be disruptive if it is sudden and unexpected. The present level of global imbalance cannot be sustained forever. It calls for action both from countries having current account surpluses and those having current account deficits. A coordinated effort is necessary to correct the imbalances to prevent a sudden down turn. International financial institutions need to play a proactive role in this regard”. During the same Annual Meeting of the ADB in Hyderabad our Finance Minister Mr. P. Chidambaram while dwelling at length on the issue of global imbalances highlighted that we have to address the global imbalance in such a manner so that the benefits of global integration continue in an uninterrupted fashion. He pointed out that Asia has an important role to play in conjunction with other countries in the process of unwinding of global imbalance. I quote from his address: “I must reiterate that to sustain the recovery process and to correct the global imbalances in an orderly manner, there is an imperative need for a cooperative approach.”  We had raised the issue of global imbalances in the Reserve Bank of India’s Annual Report of the 2002-03 realizing at that time that this problem has the potential to occupy the attention of the global economies in future. The Report observed: “Although growing imbalances may seem to be an integral feature of globalization, there are nonetheless limits to the accumulation of net claims against an economy that are implied by persistent current account deficits. The cost of servicing such claims adds to the current account deficit and, under certain circumstances, can be destabilizing” The apprehensions expressed, in retrospect, proved to be warranted. At this juncture, it is appropriate to list some important considerations that should govern initiatives in regard to resolution of global imbalances recognizing that such policy initiatives may be broadly in consonance with emerging consensus described earlier in the address.  BIS Review 56/2006 4 
First, it is necessary for multilateral institutions like IMF to be seen as symmetrical in their analysis of national economies and their relative positions in the global economy. This would add credibility to the policy advice that could be considered by each country.  Second, at the same time, action by each country will be governed by enlightened national interest. It is necessary for multilateral institutions to analyze, explore and convince how the policy actions would serve the long term national interest.  Third, it is desirable to convince the policy makers in each country that actions considered appropriate are in the long term interest of the country itself. In this regard, the contextual challenges for each economy should be given due weight. For example, in countries like India, employment and poverty reduction need to be given highest priority.  Fourth, it is essential to recognize that co-ordination is necessary given the complex situation where neither the causes nor the solutions are clear-cut. As a first step, there could, however, be a broad agreement on the directions and the first principles that are most appropriate. Emphasis on harmony in policies and search for co-operative solutions appears appropriate. (c) Possible impact of global imbalances on India As highlighted by our Finance Minister during the recent ADB annual meetings that apart from the impact on the real and external sectors, it is felt that the developments in the currency and capital market are intrinsically intertwined with the global imbalance and, therefore, in the eventuality of a disorderly correction, disruption in these markets in the form of large cross-currency volatility and sharp rise in interest rates are likely in the global economy. What could be the possible impact of less than orderly adjustment of global imbalances on the Indian economy? India does not depend on the international capital market for financing the fiscal deficit and consequently to some extent adverse consequences of the global developments would be muted. However, there could be a spill-over effect of global developments on domestic interest rates and thus on fisc also. The fiscal position of the Government could also be indirectly impacted through the nature of management of foreign exchange reserves held by the Reserve Bank.  Similarly, any abrupt adjustment in global imbalances may affect corporates, banks and households in India though the impact may be less than some other emerging economies.  With respect to the impact on corporates, if there is widening of spreads due to a shift in investor confidence in the international markets, those corporates which have borrowed at variable rates may possibly suffer more than those, which have taken loans on a fixed rate basis. Corporates which have hedged against currency and interest rate risks may escape the adverse effects. It may be noted that the Reserve Bank has been urging banks to encourage corporates to hedge their foreign currency exposures. Further, exposure of the corporate sector as a whole to the external debt is limited by indicative ceilings on external commercial borrowings imposed by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. The level of total external debt of India is currently less than the foreign exchange reserves. Although banks in India have their deposit base predominately in rupees and their investment in foreign currency assets is not large, they have been financing investment in assets, home loans and the retail market as well as equities. Like in many EMEs, asset prices have risen sharply in India too. Should there be a reversal of capital flows, asset prices may decline but the banks exposure to the risky assets have been severely restricted by Reserve Bank’s regulatory actions. Likewise, the equity market has also seen a sustained uptrend but efforts have been made by the Reserve Bank to cap the banks’ exposures. Further, banks in India have invested significantly in government debt and other fixed income securities. If a rise in international rates gets reflected in domestic interest rates, banks will have to mark down the value of their investment portfolio. To the extent a rise in international interest rates impacts the domestic interest rates, it would entail marked-to-market losses on the investment portfolios. However, the banking sector has acquired some added strength to absorb such probable shocks, largely aided by regulatory actions. As regards impact on the households, there is a risk that rises in interest rates in general could impact the housing market and expose the balance sheet of the households to interest rate risk, increasing the risk of loan losses for banks. The overall banking sector’s exposure to housing loans being relatively small, adverse developments may not have any systemic implications on the banking sector.  BIS Review 56/2006  5
(d) The emergence of oil as a new factor  The emergence of large current account surpluses among the oil exporting countries is an important recent development. The current account surplus of the oil exporting countries increased from 6.2 per cent of their GDP in 2001 to 19.1 per cent in 2005. Less than third of the combined current account surplus of the oil exporting countries has been reflected in their foreign exchange reserves which rose by US $ 90 billion in 2005. The IMF (World Economic Outlook, April 2006) has highlighted that to the extent that higher net savings by oil exporters have driven down global interest rates, and that these lower rates have boosted demand in economies with market based financial systems, such as the United States, the oil price shock may also have had an additional negative effect on the US external position.  The fact remains that the rising oil prices would result in further widening of global current account imbalances as according to consensus forecast the current account balance of the US is projected to deteriorate further in 2006. Other industrialized economies are projected to run a combined surplus led mainly by Japan and Germany. The aggregate current account surplus of the major oil exporting countries is expected to increase further in the near term.  In this regard, it may be noted that India’s oil import bill amounted to 2.9 per cent of GDP in 2001-02, but the bill climbed to 5.5 per cent of GDP in 2005-06, though in volume terms the increase has been marginal.  III. Agenda for analysis In view of complex nature of global imbalances and the way forward to minimize the risks of disorderly adjustments, it may be useful to explore possible agenda for further analysis. First, national balance sheets, as mentioned by Governor Mervyn King, could be given special attention to get a fuller picture of financial claims that countries have against other countries. Looking at the national balance sheets would also be useful to acquire a sense about the potential for adjustment, and they will give a sense of the possible impact of relative price changes on the value of assets and liabilities. The composition and size of the liabilities and assets of the national balance sheets are crucial as by viewing them together we could get a global picture. However, we should look deeper into the balance sheets in terms of disaggregating them into public and private sector components and the incomes generated in the process. A relevant observation here is the perceived higher returns to external assets held by US relative to US assets held by the rest of the world. A disaggregation enables analysis of the role of private and public sector in perpetuation as well as the resolution of imbalances. There could be dominance of bilateral claims of the private sector of one country to the public or the private sector of other country. Could such dominant bilateral claims become a noticeable force allowing, at times, non-economic factors to play a role in the whole process of engagement? Second, following the experience of the East Asian crisis of 1997-98, where private sector vulnerabilities rather than public sector imbalances played a key role in precipitating the crisis, the third generation models have explicitly brought to the fore the role of balance sheet mismatches in causing financial crises. A country’s balance sheet as evident from traditional macroeconomic aggregate could be quite sound, yet, analysis of composition and size of the liabilities and assets of the balance sheets of domestic entities may be useful in assessing vulnerability to the manner of unwinding of imbalances. It would therefore be useful to analyze the impact of global imbalances on various balance sheets within the country such as the government sector, financial sector including banks and financial institutions, non-financial private sector including corporates and households. Third, as mentioned earlier, surplus of oil exporting countries has emerged as a new factor in the debate on the global imbalance. There are some indications that the oil surpluses are being deployed in more diversified avenues than official reserves. Oil exporters appear to have taken advantage of emerging investment opportunity in stock markets and real estate. Such inflows could have helped to keep long-term interest rates as also emerging market bond spreads low, even as policy rates are rising. An interesting issue would be the nature of their responses to unwinding of global imbalances. Fourth, in a way global imbalance is a reflection of incomplete globalization. If there were complete globalization, the surplus in saving of one country could be utilized by a country which has deficit in saving as it happens among different States in India or the US. It could be argued that as the global economy integrates further, the resolution of the global imbalances might be smoother.  BIS Review 56/2006 6 
Fifth, what is the evolving role of viewing exchange rate regimes in influencing domestic economy? It is argued by some that the emerging evidence indicates that domestic price movements remain somewhat immune to considerable exchange rate movements. If so, the possibility of bringing about global rebalancing through exchange rate adjustment by itself may not be very encouraging. No doubt exchange rate would have an important role to play in global rebalancing, but the issue is its relationship with other components of the whole package like saving–investment, fiscal deficit, raising investment, structural reforms and domestic output as well as employment. The linkages among the various components described here could be very country specific.  Sixth, there is wide diversity among the Asian economies in terms of saving and investment rates, fiscal deficit, drivers of growth (domestic versus external demand) and the degree of flexibility in their exchange rates. Thus, it may be difficult to treat all of them as contributing to global financial imbalances, in the same manner, nor would all the Asian economies be identically affected by the adjustment of global financial imbalances. Correspondingly, the policy response of each country to the issue would be tailored to the circumstances. More importantly, with growing integration among Asian economies, how would the process of rebalancing affect them depending on the manner in which dominant economies in Asia manage the process? Seventh, our Prime Minister, Professor Manmohan Singh has suggested that given the potential for investment demand in the region, we must find ways of making better use of savings and finding investment avenues within the region. In this regard, an important issue would be generation of demand within the region so that the aggregate current account surpluses are absorbed in the region itself. This process of demand generation would help in orderly correction of the global imbalances Eighth, one wonders whether there is a dissonance between the perception of financial markets and that of the policy makers in regard to global imbalances. The policy makers appear to give some signals of concern, but the response of the financial markets is often out of alignment with the signals. Interestingly, anecdotal evidence shows that analysts in financial intermediaries are sensitive to the downside risk of imbalances, but the conduct of the participants does not reflect the awareness. No doubt, this sense of dissonance is not new, as for example, stock markets went up after Mr. Alan Greenspan’s statement regarding irrational exuberance. If such dissonance is true, and persists, what would be the effectiveness of public policy initiatives? Ninth, is there an advantage in assessing the non-quantifiable factors to explain the persistence of what has been stated as a stable disequilibrium to describe the current status of the global economy? For example, signature value of United States in terms of confidence of financial markets as a lasting safe-haven status could be a factor, though the issue is whether it will be valid interminably. The perception of continuing productivity gains in the US due to its proven flexibilities could be another. Lack of alternatives to deploy global savings, which are expanding may also be relevant. No doubt, these are not quantifiable, but do not cease to be relevant for analysis and assessment. Finally, is it possible that there are several intermediate scenarios between orderly adjustments and disruptive or disorderly adjustments? A series of marginal adjustments, often in spurts, could take place which may appear random, but move towards gradual lessening of imbalances through an interactive and iterative processes encompassing markets, national policies and global cooperation. The agenda for analysis proposed here may facilitate exploration of such intermediate scenarios of unwinding global imbalances. Conclusion To conclude, the performance of the Indian economy since 1980, and in particular since the reforms in the 1990s, is in many ways an impressive success story both in terms of growth and stability. The Indian economy has responded well to the rising global competition with gradually increasing integration with the world economy. The current high growth phase of the Indian economy is also coinciding with rising domestic saving rates. While India by itself hardly contributes to the current global financial imbalances, any large and rapid adjustments in major currencies and related interest rates or current accounts of trading partners could indirectly, but significantly, impact the Indian economy. We therefore have a large stake in the process of unwinding of global imbalances, and we are willing to play our part in ensuring successful outcomes from current initiatives. Thank you.

Philipp Hildebrand: Swiss monetary policy Summary of a speech by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the Annual Meeting of the IFZ (Institute for Financial Services Zug), Zug, 1 June 2006. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Having successfully pursued a strategy of money supply targets for around 25 years, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decided to adopt a fundamentally new monetary policy approach in 1999. Although it integrated some of the important elements of inflation targeting, it did so less strictly, thus allowing greater flexibility. Money stocks and credits continued to play a vital role in the new concept. Unlike the European Central Bank, the SNB chose not to make the monetary analysis a separate pillar in its concept.  An important distinction to inflation targeting is that monetary policy focuses on maintaining price stability in the medium to long term, while inflation targeting is generally oriented towards short-term and, in some cases, variable inflation targets. The SNB's monetary policy uses an inflation forecast as a central indicator and sets its operational goal in the form of a target range for the three-month Libor. A monetary policy that is geared to the medium and long term affords leeway for a certain degree of stabilisation of the real economy.  The new concept has so far proven to be very effective in a turbulent environment, enabling the SNB to react to major shocks independently and flexibly. Moreover, it has strengthened confidence in the successful preservation of monetary stability.  Compared with the SNB’s last quarterly assessment in March, many indicators now suggest stronger-than-expected growth. However, high commodity prices, rising capital market interest rates and turbulences in the equity and foreign exchange markets may also present new risks. On the whole, we still consider our strategy of gradual normalisation to be appropriate. Should the environment change, however, the SNB will not hesitate to review its monetary stance and adjust it, if necessary.  The current cyclical boom should not obscure the fact that the Swiss domestic market still needs further structural reforms to ensure sustained economic growth, thus safeguarding our prosperity and preparing the economy for the demographic challenges ahead.

Yiu-kwan Choi: The debt market of Hong Kong - what can we offer to investors? Keynote address by Mr Yiu-kwan Choi, Deputy Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, at the third Annual Asia Pacific Bond Congress, Hong Kong, 13 June 2006. *      *      * Mr. Shale, distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to speak at this year’s Asia Pacific Bond Congress. On behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, I would like to extend my warmest welcome to everyone here today, especially those of you who have traveled from afar to visit us. I would like also to thank Euromoney for organizing this excellent event, and for organizing it in Hong Kong for the third time. It is a clear recognition of the important role of Hong Kong - Asia's World City, in the bond markets of the Asia Pacific region. Like many other financial markets, the bond markets in the Asia Pacific region have recently seen plenty of new developments, challenges as well as opportunities. I am glad to see that the Congress has rightly covered many of these latest issues, and I am sure that for those who were here yesterday would have learnt from my colleague, Ms Julia Leung, about the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s efforts in enhancing regional cooperation. So today it would probably be useful for me to take a few minutes to share with you on what the HKMA has been doing to develop our bond market, and more importantly, what our market can offer to investors. Development of the bond market in Hong Kong Let me give you a quick overview of the current status of the Hong Kong dollar debt market. At the end of 2005, the value of outstanding Hong Kong dollar debt reached $660 billion HK dollars, equivalent to $85 billion US dollars, which is over 30 times the size of the market 14 years ago. The size of the HK dollar debt market relative to GDP also increased significantly to 48% in 2005 from 3% in 1991. In 2005, the gross issuance of Hong Kong dollar debt reached $400 billion HK dollars, or an equivalent of $51 billion US dollars. Everyday, overseas borrowers, financial institutions and corporations participate actively in our market. In Asia, our market has the highest proportion of overseas issues, with the amount outstanding being only second to Japan and Korea. While we have a very well developed debt market today, one should be aware that there was virtually no debt market in Hong Kong before the 90s. Because of cumulative fiscal surplus, the Hong Kong government had not found it necessary to borrow any money in the market at that time. While this is good from the point of view of fiscal management, it was not conducive to debt market development, in the sense that we did not have a representative yield curve for the Hong Kong dollar. As we all know, a liquid and deep debt market is an important component of a financial centre. The HKMA therefore decided to develop a local debt market through a two-pronged approach, namely to develop a market of high quality Exchange Fund paper, and to build an efficient financial infrastructure. A market for exchange fund paper In order to facilitate the development of a Hong Kong dollar debt market, the HKMA rolled out the Exchange Fund Bills and Notes programme in 1990. This initiative has been very successful in creating a yield curve for Hong Kong dollar. As of today, the yield curve has been extended up to 10 years and serves as a benchmark for debt instruments issued by other entities in the local market. In order to maintain a liquid market for the Exchange Fund paper, the HKMA has also put in place a market-making system under which market makers are obliged to quote two-way prices. Currently, 26 banks in Hong Kong have been appointed as market makers, and tenders of Exchange Fund Bills and Notes of maturities between 3 months and 10 years are held regularly. These arrangements have been effective to help promote the liquidity of the Exchange Fund paper and enhance the credibility of the Hong Kong dollar yield curve. Indeed, overseas borrowers have BIS Review 56/2006  1
remained the largest issuers in our market, with outstanding debts reaching an equivalent of 32 billion US dollars at the end of 2005, from just 1.3 billion US dollars at the end of 1997. Financial infrastructure Let me now move on to another important area of our work: that is the building of an efficient financial infrastructure for the bond market. Our objective is to build a multi-currencies and multi-product payment and settlement platform to make Hong Kong the payment and settlement hub of the region. We believe that a safe and efficient payment and settlement system is crucial to the development of the debt market. Our system will serve not only the local investors but also investors elsewhere in the region to facilitate their fund transfers and delivery versus payments when they buy or sell debt instruments. We have therefore been working actively on linkages between the Central Moneymarkets Unit (the CMU), which is our key custodian system for debt instruments in Hong Kong, and other custodian systems in the region and international custodian systems such as the Euroclear and Clearstream. These linkages have been instrumental in fostering cross-border bond trading and investment. With the seamless interfaces between the CMU and the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems in Hong Kong for the Hong Kong dollar, US dollar and Euro, all transactions in debt instruments denominated in any of these three currencies and under the custodianship of the CMU can be settled in Hong Kong on a DvP basis in an efficient way. The recent IPO of the Bank of China Limited is probably a good example to demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our HKD RTGS system: being a settlement system which typically handles an average turnover of $400 to $500 billion Hong Kong dollars a day, it saw a record high turnover of $1.23 trillion on 1 June when the Bank of China was listed on that day. Notwithstanding such huge amount of settlement, the inter-bank payments were processed smoothly on that day. To further develop Hong Kong into a payment and settlement hub for the region, we will continue to explore opportunities for linking our RTGS systems and the CMU with similar systems in the region. For example, the HKMA has been working with Bank Negara Malaysia for the establishment of a link between the Ringgit RTGS system and the US dollar RTGS system in Hong Kong. This is aimed at reducing the settlement risk of Ringgit/US dollar foreign exchange transactions through PvP settlement in the Asian time zone. The link is expected to go live by the end of 2006. We are exploring similar linkages with other Asian central banks. Bond Price Bulletin One of the factors affecting secondary market activities in the bond market is the lack of information on bond prices. To help overcome this problem, the HKMA launched the Bond Price Bulletin at the beginning of 2006. The bulletin provides investors with convenient on-line access to information on bond products and bond prices provided by eight major banks in Hong Kong. Indicative bid/offer prices of over 200 bonds of different currencies issued by both public and private sector entities are provided by the eight contributing banks. Outlook Let me now turn to talk about the outlook of our debt market. Notwithstanding the achievements we have made so far in developing our debt market, we fully appreciate that there is nothing to be complacent and there are still many challenges facing us. The HKMA has therefore embarked on a review of our debt market development with a view to identifying measures which can be adopted to help market development. On the demand side, everybody knows that the Mainland of China is enjoying a rapid economic growth and business opportunities are mushrooming. The recent announcement by the Mainland authorities of measures to liberalise portfolio investment outflows has marked the emergence of such kind of opportunity for Hong Kong. Under these new rules, each Chinese citizen is allowed, among other things, to invest in fixed income securities overseas within certain limits. We expect that this will help boost the demand for fixed income securities although we do not know exactly how much such investment outflows will be approved by the Mainland authorities in the initial years.  BIS Review 56/2006 2 
Given our experience and achievements in financial services and the fact that we are the only international financial centre of China, I am sure that Hong Kong is well positioned to grasp the opportunity. Apart from the initiatives and developments I just mentioned, I believe that it would be useful to highlight a few fundamental factors which make Hong Kong an ideal place for the bond market. The first is our free capital mobility. The absence of capital controls means that there are no restrictions on foreign enterprises using our capital markets to raise funds. Foreign investors can also freely invest in our markets and easily remit the proceeds back home. Secondly, our well-developed financial markets, including derivative markets, would allow issuers and investors to manage any interest rate risk or exchange rate risk effectively. Thirdly, Hong Kong has a critical mass of financial institutions which stand ready to support issuers to tap the capital markets. Hong Kong is also an asset management centre thus providing a large investor base for debt instruments. Last but not least, the absence of capital gains tax and interest withholding tax would also favour bond market development. Our exceptional geographical, cultural and language advantages also make Hong Kong an ideal place to link up the Mainland of China with the rest of world. On our part, the HKMA will continue to play a leading role in enhancing the development of the debt market in Hong Kong, by removing market frictions and unnecessary restrictions, and by keeping up with the best practices adopted in other well-developed markets. Lastly, I would like to thank Euromoney again for inviting me to speak. I look forward to the continued cooperation with our partners on the healthy development of the bond market in this region. Thank you. BIS Review 56/2006  3
Jean-Pierre Roth: No news, good news - transparency and communication in monetary policy Address by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Annual Meeting of the European Business Press, Zurich, 16 June 2006. This paper was prepared with the support of Martin Brown, International Research and Technical Assistance Section, Swiss National Bank. *      *      * Introductory remarks Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure to address you here, on the occasion of your annual meeting. I would like to take this unique opportunity to talk about an issue which, in recent years, has strongly affected my job as a central bank's President and your work as journalists: transparency and communication in monetary policy.  Over the past two decades, central banks, especially in Europe, have undoubtedly be-come more transparent. Central bankers now regularly communicate their assessment of inflationary pressures to the public and go to great lengths to explain their monetary policy stance. Gone are the days when central banks argued that secrecy was an essential ingredient of an effective monetary policy. As a consequence, monetary policy decisions are no longer taken at irregular intervals or at weekends, in order to surprise markets on Monday mornings. This, of course, is fortunate for business journalists. You no longer need to spend your weekends worrying that you might have to suddenly start writing about a surprise policy intervention.  As you may have guessed though, the main reason for central bank transparency is not to make your weekends more relaxing. Central bankers today pursue a policy of broad information because we believe that transparency helps us fulfil our mandate. We are convinced that monetary policy is most effective and least disruptive if it is predictable: no news on monetary policy is good news.  In the following, I would like to discuss why, today, central bankers think transparency is crucial for a successful monetary policy and how the Swiss National Bank attempts to achieve transparency in practice. I shall then debate the limitations of what transparency Finally, I would like to reflect upon how transparency in monetary policy may affect the relationship between you, the journalists, and us, the central bankers.  1.  The case for transparency  At the Swiss National Bank we see three main reasons to be transparent about our monetary policy.  The first reason is that we count on transparency to enhance the effectiveness of our monetary policy. In the public eye, central banks may be viewed as almighty. The plain reality is, however, that our open market operations only have a direct influence on current short-term interest rates. Economic activity and thus future price developments are, however, determined primarily by the shape of the yield curve, i.e. by the expectation of future monetary actions. Transparency about how we judge future inflationary pressures enables us to guide expectations about future short-term interest rates and thus also long-term interest rates.  The second reason is that transparency reduces the inevitable uncertainties related to monetary policy implementation. If markets know how we judge future inflationary pressures and how we may react to these, they can better predict our future monetary policy. Improved predictability of monetary policy leads to fewer painful surprises in the economy. Moreover, less uncertainty about monetary policy reduces both risk premiums in financial markets, and financing costs.  The third rationale for central bank transparency is public and political accountability. Central banks are mandated to act in the interest of their country, usually by maintaining price stability. This can imply unpopular decisions, which is essentially the reason for central bank independence. . Central banks should thus be free from public and political pressure. But it is obvious that some mechanism must be set in place to ensure accountability of independent central banks. Transparency about monetary policy is essential to central bank ensure accountability. However, transparency in itself is BIS Review 55/2006 1 
not enough. The statements made by central bankers must be accessible to the public and must be subject to scrutiny. Here, a critical press has a very important role to play.  2.  Communication of monetary policy by the Swiss National Bank  In order to improve monetary policy effectiveness and enable public accountability the Swiss National Bank started to regularly explain its monetary policy decisions to the public already in the 1970's. Our first press conference was conducted in November 1974, shortly after the collapse of the Bretton-Woods fixed exchange rate regime. Moreover, from 1975 onwards we published yearly goals for the growth of monetary aggregates in order to guide market expectations of interest rates and inflation.  With the introduction of our new monetary policy concept six years ago, we took three specific measures in order to further enhance our transparency:  • First, we have defined consumer price inflation of less than 2% as our quantitative goal for price stability. This step has enhanced the predictability of our monetary policy because market participants know exactly what we want to achieve. They can expect monetary policy to be tightened if we believe that inflation could exceed 2%.  • As a second step, we now regularly publish a medium-term inflation forecast. This forecast helps market participants to predict future monetary policy because they not only know our goal for inflation, but also how we judge future inflationary pressures.  • Our third step towards more transparency has been to explicitly communicate our operational target. We announce our target as a 1% band on short-term interest rates, that is, on the three-month Libor. We thus regularly offer market participants a quantitative indicator of changes in our monetary policy stance.  Our experience with the systematic communication of our monetary policy during the past six years has been very positive. Market predictions of monetary policy measures have been accurate, leading to lower volatility in financial markets and improving the effectiveness of our policy measures A prime example of this is the most recent increase in our operational target in March 2006. An analysis of interest rate movements shows that the increase of our operational target by 25 basis points was almost fully anticipated by financial markets prior to the announcement. Contrary to what many believe, a central bank does not lose any prestige in seeing its policy correctly anticipated by the markets. It is just proof of a well-understood monetary strategy.  3.  Credibility - words are not enough  In Switzerland, the systematic communication of monetary policy has had the desired effect of getting market participants to adapt their expectations well before actual policy interventions are made. Does this mean that the Swiss National Bank now only has to indicate its intentions in order to influence interest rates? Or as some academics and practitioners have posed the question: can central bankers now replace open market operations with "open mouth" interventions?  Considering the recent tightening of monetary policy in Switzerland, one might be tempted to agree that open mouth operations are sufficient to move interest rates. After all, short-term interest rates rose long before an increase in the operational target was announced or before we raised the actual interest rates on repo transactions. However, this interpretation of the data ignores one crucial issue. Interest rates moved upwards before the Swiss National Bank adapted its operational target or its repo rate because financial markets trusted that we would increase interest rates. Given our objectives and our previous track record, it was credible that we would hike interest rates in the given economic environment. Central bank transparency can only improve monetary policy effectiveness if it increases the predictability of future monetary measures. I would like to emphasise that predictability relies not just on information and the communication of intentions, but also on whether the public trusts a central bank to realise these intentions. Central bankers can thus only benefit from transparency if their statements about future monetary policy are credible. Ultimately, we know that our words must be matched by our actions. 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
4.  Transparency and press coverage of monetary policy  Ladies and gentlemen, central bank transparency yields economic benefits because it enhances monetary policy effectiveness and reduces uncertainties. Moreover, in a de-mocratic state, transparency is essential if independent central banks are to be held accountable by the public. I am therefore convinced that central banks around the world will continue to pursue a policy of openness for a long time to come. This leads me to an important question for all of us here: how will transparency about monetary policy affect future relations between the press and central banks.  Does central bank transparency mean that future monetary policy will be boring, and that press coverage of central bank interventions will become obsolete? Looking at your coverage of our policy one might be inclined to think so. Between 2001 and 2005, for example, the Swiss National Bank was mentioned three times less in the Financial Times than in the period 1996 to 2000. However, let me emphasise that more transparency does not mean that monetary policy will always be simple to predict. Remember that the inflation forecasts published by central banks are always based on expectations of future economic developments. Hopefully, these expectations will be accurate most of the time. However, during certain periods of the economic cycle, particularly at turning points, our expectations will be prone to correction. I am therefore confident that, despite transparency, there will remain some news to report about monetary policy.  I do believe, however, that central bank transparency may change the nature of media reports on monetary policy. In the old days of secrecy and unexpected monetary interventions, journalists obviously debated the objectives of central bankers and what this meant for the future. With increased transparency, such discussions have become obsolete, as objectives seem to be clear and future policy is easier to predict. In return, central bank transparency now gives journalists the opportunity to question the consistency of our monetary policy decisions with our stated objectives. This leads me to believe that, in future, media coverage of monetary policy may concentrate on scrutinising the congruency of our actions with our goals, rather than debating about what central banks are trying to achieve. As a central bank governor, I would certainly welcome such a development.  After all, the credibility of our monetary policy ultimately depends on whether the public believes that we match our words with our actions.  BIS Review 55/2006 3 
Stanley Fischer: The Israeli economy Acceptance speech by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, for an Honorary Degree, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 11 June 2006. *      *      * It is a pleasure and an honor for me to speak today as the recipient of an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the Hebrew University, and it is an even greater honor to have been asked to speak on behalf of my distinguished fellow honorees. I would like to start by congratulating the students on whom doctoral degrees are being bestowed today. You have earned the congratulations and good wishes of all for the ability and dedication you have shown in completing your doctorates, and we wish you every success and happiness in your future careers. By European and American standards, this is a young university. Its founding ceremony took place in 1925, at this spot, in the presence of Lord Balfour, Viscount Allenby, High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, Haim Nachman Bialik, Nahum Sokolov, Harav Kook, Harav Meir, and 10,000 others. That extraordinary turnout testifies to the importance the inhabitants of the Yishuv and of the Zionist movement attached to the founding of what they called the University of the Jewish people. The University already possesses a proud history, an essential part of the history of modern Israel, of the history of the Jewish people and their successful but ongoing struggle to establish a modern state in the ancient land of our forefathers. Each of the honorary degree recipients here has been closely associated with the Hebrew University in the past, and for each of us this day brings back memories, of times, of colleagues, of friends. In my case among the personal memories are those of Don Patinkin, former President of the University, of Yoram Ben-Porath, also a former President of the University, and of Michael Bruno, former Governor of the Bank of Israel. And for many of us, this spot and this occasion will always be associated with the image of Yitzhak Rabin, receiving an Honorary Degree from the University immediately after the Six Day War. For me, the Hebrew University has always been special. When I graduated from the London School of Economics it was at the Hebrew University that I most hoped to teach. Later I did teach here, but as a visitor on sabbaticals, not as a faculty member. This is the community in which Rhoda and I have formed some of our firmest and most lasting friendships. Each of my fellow honorees can talk of the friendships and the attachments they have formed among this community of scholars and in this city. And every one of us will attest to the joy and the pride we feel at being recognized by our colleagues of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have been asked to talk today about the Israeli economy. In brief, the economy is doing well. It grew by 5.2 percent last year, and the data for the most recent quarter show an acceleration of growth. Current forecasts are that the economy will grow by about 5 percent this year again. The budget deficit last year was below 2 percent, and it is likely to be below 1 percent this year. Our inflation rate is low. The exchange rate of the shekel is remarkably stable despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the Bank of Israel has not intervened in the currency markets since 1997, and does not intend to do so except in truly exceptional situations. We have a current account surplus. The unemployment rate is declining, though unfortunately we have not yet seen a decline in the poverty rate. We are about to enter the fourth year of growth that began in the middle of 2003, at the end of the deepest recession in the history of Israel. That recession started late in 2000 as a result of four adverse shocks to our economy: the collapse of the high-tech boom and the Nasdaq bubble that had enabled so many Israeli high-tech startups to flourish; the global recession that started in 2001; the tailing off of the immigration from the former Soviet Union to Israel; and the second intifada. It was worsened by an inconsistent set of policy responses to the recession. By 2003 the global recession was ending, and in 2004 growth was higher than it had been in twenty years. The high tech sector was recovering. The security situation in Israel improved markedly. And the Israeli government in 2003 committed itself to a fiscal framework designed to restore confidence in Israel's ability to finance itself, to reduce the share of government spending in the economy, and gradually to reduce the tax burden. The government also initiated a program of structural reforms, BIS Review 55/2006 1 
including privatizations that had been talked about for at least 20 years, and reforms of the benefits system designed to reduce disincentives to work. Over the past three years the government has carried out the program to which it committed itself. This, together with a well-defined inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy, has contributed to strengthening the confidence of Israelis and of foreign investors in the Israeli economy. That confidence is manifest not only in the recovery of growth, but also in the relative stability of our financial markets and of the shekel, most evident during the last few weeks in which general concerns about emerging market countries have led to significant currency depreciations and sharp stock market declines in other countries. This is an impressive performance. But we need to set it in perspective. It was only in 2005 that per capita income in Israel returned to its level in 2000. If we are to move beyond our current status, where our income level is about that of the poorer European countries, below Spain, above Portugal, close to that of Greece, we need to keep growing, and rapidly. Per capita income in Israel is about $18,500. If the economy grows at 5 percent for the next decade, we will reach a per capita income level above $25,500. That would make a real difference to our standard of living and our ability to contend with the range of issues facing us, including poverty, and the security situation. What would it take to keep the economy growing at a rapid rate for a prolonged period? First, a factor that is beyond our control: the global economy needs to keep growing. Second, a factor that is partly under our control: our security situation. Standing here, on the eastern side of Jerusalem, with a view behind us to the West Bank, we must be aware of our need to find a way to live with our Palestinian neighbors. Third, a set of factors that is entirely within our control: our own economic policies. We need a general approach to economic policy that relies primarily on markets to allocate resources, while recognizing the essential role of the state, especially in the provision of public goods. At the same time, we need to accept the fact that no small economy can flourish except by integrating into the global economy, as Israel has so successfully done over the past fifty years. Indeed, the opening of the capital account in the last fifteen years, the end of foreign exchange controls, has had a profound and positive effect on the entire economy. In macroeconomic policy, we need to maintain the fiscal discipline that has served us so well for the past three years. We still have a government debt to GDP ratio that is too high and that makes us vulnerable to any serious loss of confidence in the Israeli economy, by Israelis and by foreigners. To reduce the debt to GDP ratio we need to keep budget deficits small, and we need to keep growing. Government spending as a share of GDP in Israel is still very high by international standards, and needs to be reduced. Tax rates should continue to decline, as already planned. It is possible to do all that while leaving room in the budget to increase social and other essential government spending. We can help alleviate poverty in the short run by restoring some of the cuts in welfare spending, particularly for the elderly and for the disabled, which were undertaken to get us out of economic crisis three years ago. But in doing so, we need to maintain and strengthen incentives to work for those able to do so. In the long run, the best way to improve the welfare of the poor is through growth. And in the long run, growth comes primarily through technical progress, through improvements in knowledge and the ability to apply that knowledge to production. That is obvious in Israel, where the high-tech sector has played such a prominent role in our growth. Here is where higher education and the universities come in. The creation of the Hebrew University is in many ways a miracle. It was no small matter to establish a university that meets international standards in a community as small as that of the Yishuv in Palestine, as far as it then was from the centers of academic life. Idealism, Zionism, and – sadly – the destruction of the Jewish communities in Europe, helped strengthen the University in the pre- and post-World War II periods. It is also no small matter to have established a system of higher education as good as that in Israel. But the university system is under serious strain. At one time almost all Israelis who went abroad for Ph.D's returned. Now most do not. That is partly a matter of relative salaries, it is also a matter of the unavailability of positions. If the universities are to remain strong, indeed to become stronger, and to help keep Israel at the scientific frontier, they need more money. That money does not have to come from the government. Some of it can come from the licensing and sale of intellectual property, an approach in which the Hebrew University has been very successful. 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
But that will not be enough. To strengthen the universities, it will sooner or later be necessary to charge more to the students receiving university education. That can be done without compromising the right to a higher education of any qualifying student, for instance through some variant of the Australian plan which provides loans to students, which they repay as they enter the labor force and begin to earn. In the past Israeli students have strongly objected to any significant rise in tuition. That is understandable. But significantly higher tuition payments are needed to enable the universities to attract the faculty they need and to continue to contribute to advancing Israel's technological progress and prowess. In concluding, I must apologize for making so utilitarian an argument for strengthening the universities. For a good university is far more than a source of technological progress; it is a repository and source of knowledge, of culture, of values, of civilization. That too is why a society – why Israel – needs to cherish and support its universities and its system of higher education. Thank you. BIS Review 55/2006 3 
Shamshad Akhtar: Perspectives on Pakistan’s monetary policy developments Address by Dr Shamshad Akhtar, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, as chief guest at the Woodrow Wilson Centre, Washington DC, 24 April 2006. The references for the speech can be found on the State Bank of Pakistan’s website. *      *      * I.  Introduction In line with trends world-wide, Pakistan adopted liberal and market-oriented monetary policies and procedures in the 1990s. This involved a move to indirect tools of monetary policy management and a major departure from the age-old practice of relying on direct interventions, such as liquidity reserve ratios and credit ceilings and controls. Accompanying this policy change were gradual changes to the legal and institutional framework of monetary policy formulation, its targeting and operating procedures as well as development of infrastructure for treasury operation to allow for effective open market operations. These changes have had a subtle but profound impact on monetary management which in turn has impacted economic management of Pakistan. Like in several other places, there however remains a level of ignorance regarding the virtues and technicalities of monetary policy management and there is a debate on some key issues. Academics often question the relevance of policy goals and tools because of their different ideological stances and positioning. Structuralists doubt whether monetary policy has any significant impact, in particular on price stability. Frustrations are also evident among different economic players who are forced to change their behaviors and expectations in line with tighter monetary discipline and interest rate adjustments. There is less understanding and patience for the lagged effects of monetary policy to defuse the inflationary pressures or to ease the liquidity conditions. Recognizing the concerns and debate, Pakistan’s central bank regularly reviews the monetary policy in line with the evolving changes in the structure and workings of financial markets as well as in the broader economic and political environment. Since the mid-1990s, State bank has further strengthened the market-orientation of policy implementation, cut reserve requirements, developed open market operations, increased the flexibility of liquidity management, sharpened the focus on interest rates while maintaining reserve money as the operating target, improved the transparency of policy signals and shortened the maturity of interest rates serving as the fulcrum of policy. I propose to initially provide few perspectives on the evolution of monetary policy, its challenges and practical difficulties in its implementation and then share with you the monetary policy outlook for 2006 and finally lead into a discussion of some of the complications and challenges in the conduct of monetary policy. II.  Policy, legal and institutional improvements in monetary management Monetary policy of Pakistan now for some years has been largely supportive of the dual objective of promoting economic growth and price stability. It achieves this goal by targeting monetary aggregates (broad money supply growth as an intermediate target and reserve money as an operational target) in accordance with real GDP growth and inflation targets set by the Government. Qualitatively monetary policy formulation and its implementation has improved substantially, benefiting from the following actions. • First, legislative changes to the State Bank of Pakistan Act has empowered the SBP and SBP Central Board to formulate, conduct and implement its monetary policy • Second, a Monetary and Fiscal Board has been set up to ensure formal monetary and fiscal policy coordination and this Board is currently chaired by the Prime Minister in his capacity as Finance Minister with representation from economic ministries. • Third, the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act 2005 mandates a steady reduction in revenue deficit to zero by 30th June 2008 and maintaining it thereafter, and reducing total public debt to sixty percent of GDP by 2013 and below that limit thereafter. BIS Review 55/2006 1 
These two principal steps lay the foundation for reducing fiscal subservience of monetary policy that for years served to complicate monetary management and allowed the Government unlimited recourse to low and fixed interest rate financing. • Fourth, SBP continues to refine the institutional mechanism for monetary policy formulation and its regular review. For instance, SBP has replaced the Open Market Policy and Review Committee by the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Committee. This Committee meets bimonthly to establish parameters of broad monetary policy and reviews monetary and economic conditions on a regular basis and recommends changes in monetary policy instruments. • Fifth, SBP Treasury's capacity has been strengthened to manage financial markets and related activities more effectively. Proactive conduct of monetary operations and management of market volatility has helped improve market flows. The Open Market Operation (OMO) process has been institutionalized with better flexibility vis-à-vis tenors and frequency. From 1995 - 2005, SBP's monetary operations were focused on T-Bill Auctions and predetermined schedule of weekly OMOs of fixed tenors with no forecasting capability of market liquidity. This resulted in a high degree of volatility in Overnight (O/N) & Shortterm Money Market rates. During 2005, SBP Treasury introduced the Money Market Computerized Reporting System (MM-CRS) for banks which helped in not only assessing the market liquidity, but to improving the grip on market gaps and interbank activity, thus strengthening the market management capability and SBP's forecasting capacity.  Between Apr-Dec 2005, not only OMOs have been conducted both ways, but with a greater flexibility of tenors and frequency. Additionally, being active in the Swap Market has helped SBP Treasury to mop-up/inject USD/Rupee liquidity in the money market, as and when required, thus complementing the monetary management. This has resulted in managing excessive market volatility, providing effective signals/direction to the market and to set benchmarks for the rupee inter-bank market in line with the monetary policy stance. Consequently, O/N Rates now move within a 100bp – 150bp range compared to previous trends when it fluctuated between zero to 9.0%. III.  Monetary outlook for 2006 and associated challenges. Current fiscal year is an important departure from the preceding few years’ monetary stance and trends observed. After 3-4 years of lax monetary policy, Pakistan faced significant monetary overhang since the growth in broad money supply every year exceeded the growth in nominal GDP. Since the second quarter of 2005 monetary policy was tightened as the headline inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), reached close to 11.1 in April 2005 - edging beyond the yearly target of 8% with Wholesale Price Index (WPI) pointing to the risk of moving to double digits. It has to be further recognized that given structural issues, the inflation threshold for developing countries is high - inflation in excess of 8- 12% is found to hurt economic growth.1To start off, SBP raised discount rate to 9% in April 2005 which generated an uptrend in interest rates on T-bills auctioned and sharpened its yield curve: 3 months Tbill rate rose from 4.3 % Jan 05 to 8.1% by mid April 2006, 6 months 4.3% to 8.3% and one year from 5% in early 05 to 8.8%. Has this monetary tightening achieved the desired results i.e. of curbing inflationary pressures? Latest trends of CPI are comforting but reveal different levels of deceleration across CPI categories and point to lingering concerns whether the deceleration will continue and/or if the decline in CPI and its components is there to stay. Some numbers are illustrative of this concern. • While CPI had dropped to 6.9% YOY by March 2006 (compared to 10.2% recorded in the same month last year) with food inflation falling to 5.4% (compared to 13.3% in March 2005), the level of decline in nonfood inflation has been modest at 8.0% (compared to 8.2% in March 2005).                                                       1  Khan, S. Mohsin and Abdelhak, S. Senhadji: Threshold Effects in the Relationship Between Inflation and Growth. IMF Staff Papers, Volume 48, Number 1, June 2001. 2 BIS Review 55/2006 
• While month to month comparison point to sharper decline in inflation rate, the period average CPI and 12 month moving average CPI are still at 8.2% and 8.6%, respectively which is above the target inflation rate of 8%. • The core inflation (measuring the non-volatile components) however confirms the deceleration in inflationary pressure as core CPI was down to 6.7% in March 2006 relative to 7.6% in March FY05 and the decline is 6.1% (compared to 8.0% in March 2005), if 20% trimmed mean is calculated. IV.  Realities and complications facing monetary policy In evaluating the effectiveness of the monetary stance on inflation there is need to recognize some economic realities and complications which eventually help in developing an appropriate policy response. Inflation, growth and financial development Nexus: MOHSIN S. KHAN AND AXEL SCHIMMELPFENNIG (2005)2 conclude an inverse relationship between inflation and real per capita GDP: when inflation was 8 percent on average during 1978-1991, per capita growth averaged 3 percent but when inflation rose to 11% during 1992 and 1997 real per capita growth averaged only 1 percent and it further recovered as inflation fell to 5 percent. Further this study concludes that “the direct inflation-growth nexus suggests a threshold in the range of 4 to 9 percent, while the inflation-financial development nexus suggests a lower threshold of 3– 6 percent….. Based on this, it is further recommended that SBP adopts an inflation target of 5 percent.” This evidence has been arrived at based on empirical evidence of a number of studies: For instance: • In a panel of 140 countries, Khan and Senhadji (2001) estimate inflation threshold to be 1–3 percent for industrial countries and 7–11 percent in developing countries. • Focusing on Middle East and Central Asian countries including Pakistan, Khan (2005) estimates the optimum inflation rate to be 3 percent and argues that policy-makers should keep inflation below 6 percent to avoid a negative impact on growth. • Mubarik (2005) using time-series data for Pakistan from 1973 to 20003 finds that inflation in excess of 9 percent harms short-run growth in Pakistan. • Hussain (2005) estimates thresholds of 4–6 percent beyond which inflation adversely affect growth. Furthermore, inflation hurts growth by making financial intermediation costly as high interest rates raise costs and lower long-run real returns for the corporate sector, while introducing adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Lags in transmission mechanism. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a 6-24 months time lag in developing economies in the transmission of monetary policy impact on aggregate demand. In Pakistan, studies point that this lag is in the range of 12-18 months. It is because of this that the tolerance level of the economy for the fairly accommodative and easy monetary policy adopted over FY00-04 was remarkable as inflation remained low over this period with an average level of 3.9%. Admittedly, fiscal borrowing pressures during this period being low also provided scope for private sector credit growth. However, monetary overhang of few years of accommodative monetary policy finally generated inflationary pressures which remained entrenched for some period. Consequent monetary tightening, now in place for over one year, is eventually showing signs of transmission channels working as evident from CPI deceleration.                                                       2  Mohsin S. Khan and Axel Schimmelpfennig: Inflation in Pakistan: Money or Wheat? Paper presented in SBP conference, November 2005. 3  The authors use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to reduce volatility in the data which potentially removes relevant information. Furthermore, in a single country case, the threshold will be restricted to be within the range of inflation experienced by that country. BIS Review 55/2006 3 
An SBP Working Paper on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy4 studies the relative importance of four channels through which monetary policy shocks are transmitted in Pakistan. While other transmission channels have yet to fully manifest themselves, banks have been observed to play a major role in the transmission mechanism with private sector credit as the leading indicator. But monetary policy transmission mechanism of this channel is weak because of the low impact of the interest rate channel, and also because the transmission mechanism cannot be developed on the basis of the short end of the yield curve, it needs a spectrum of rates in order to develop further, and the government has kept closed the long-term rate structure by holding off PIB auctions. Going forward, we need to work on strengthening the transmission mechanism by (a) further strengthening the banking sector, and (b) developing the market and the long-term yield curve. Is inflation a structural supply side or monetary phenomena? While supply side factors do play a role in short term, inflation is always a long-term monetary phenomenon driven by demand pressures. Inflation trends follow broad money growth and private sector credit growth closely with a lag of about 12 months and above. Given these factors, (i) SBP monitors CPI food and non-food inflation and (ii) two core inflation indictors that (a) excludes all volatile components and constitutes principally of a non-food and non-energy index and (b) another is derived as 20% weighted trimmed mean.5 While (i) reflects overall price trends, the main driver for monetary policy is the core inflation. On the supply side, price behavior is impacted by structural impediments facing the agriculture and industry sector which ranges from year to year fluctuations in crops and industrial capacity, distributional problems and sometimes hoarding practices. In Pakistan, supply factors influence 55% of CPI which accounts for three commodity groups (i.e. food and beverages, fuel and lightening and transport and communication) and food alone accounts for 40.3% of CPI and wheat (and wheat flour) has a weightage of 5.7%. Is inflation a fiscal phenomenon. Studies for Pakistan have confirmed that excessive government’s recourse to the central bank for financing fiscal deficit is inflationary in the long-run and complicates monetary management and its implementation. Fiscal deficit has a direct impact on inflation as government expenditure constitutes a large part of aggregate expenditure that might lead to demand pull inflation, and an indirect impact as the fiscal deficit is financed partly through central banks. With the reduction in fiscal deficit in recent years, both the direct and indirect impacts of deficit have been low and headline inflation remained low. Exception to this is FY06 when fiscal pressures have been stronger partly because of the unanticipated earthquake spending but more significant because of the inherent weaknesses in the structure of taxes as the tax/GDP ratio has been low. These trends have interrupted compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The Act underscores a zero primary balance and a steady reduction in the overall fiscal balance with the objective of reducing Pakistan’s debt/GDP ratio to sustainable levels. Fiscal dominance of monetary policy would remain until the taxation structure is overhauled and there are explicit legal provisions which limit government’s recourse to central bank financing that in turn will induce further fiscal discipline while encouraging mobilizing funding requirements from the market. Legally, SBP has recourse to section 9(A) of the SBP Act which allows the SBP to take a decision, in consultation with the board, on the total government borrowing as specified below: “the Governor may ….. determine and enforce, in addition to the overall expansion of liquidity, the limit of credit to be extended by the Bank to the Federal Government, Provincial Governments and other agencies …..”  Aside from the need for better understanding in this area, issuance of debt securities has the additional benefit of diversifying debt financing sources by encouraging development of the long term debt market in Pakistan.                                                       4  Ahmed, Noor & Hastam, Shah & Agha, Asif Idrees and Mubarik, Yasir Ali (2005), “Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy in Pakistan”, SBP Working Paper Series. 5  All CPI items are arranged according to their YOY changes in a given month, 20% items showing extreme changes are excluded with 10% of the items at the top of the list and 10% of the items at the bottom of the list. The weighted mean of the price changes of the rest of the items is core inflation. 4 BIS Review 55/2006 
The impact of monetary tightening on inflation would have been more visible if the government had kept its recourse to central bank financing at manageable levels. Over the last few months, there were concerns that the drift in fiscal management would persist and derail low and stable inflationary trend.6 The stock of Marketable Treasury Bills held by SBP did rise to over Rs 540 billion but this was brought down to Rs 400 billion as the Government retired a part of its obligations with PTCL proceeds. Minimizing fiscal dominance is a key pre-condition for an efficient conduct of monetary policy and for enhancing central bank independence.7V.  Medium term outlook In reviewing the monetary policy stance at this juncture, SBP recognizes the potential downside risks to the medium term macroeconomic outlook: • First, international crude prices remain a potent threat to overall price stability. While the pass-through of international crude prices has been managed well so far, further escalations could immediately endanger the fragile balance that currently prevails between the budget management, oil companies and consumers. • Second, portfolio switches and liquidity mismatches that have emerged have produced sizeable volatility in reserve money with an upward pressure on money supply, combined with a shortening of maturity of deposits in the banking system. Demand deposits have grown faster than time deposits and certificate of deposits have become an important source of funding for certain banks. These developments warrant continuous and careful monitoring so as to be on guard against the incipient build-up of potential demand pressures. • Third, continued vigilance is required to examine possible strains on credit quality especially to ensure financial stability and thereby derive synergies with macroeconomic and price stability. • Fourth, the surge in imports has produced a sizeable expansion in the current account deficit in the first half of FY06 despite a significant of growth of exports. Higher oil prices accounted for 28% of the increase in oil bill and 47% of the increase in external current account deficit. Concurrently, there has been high demand for capital goods, raw material and intermediate goods (including fertilizer, non-ferrous metals and iron and steel) and some of this is expected to help in enhancing industrial capacity utilization. Management of external current account deficit pressures and their non-debt financing would be critical for the next few years. Recognizing this, the foreign exchange reserves would be kept at prudent levels to provide cover for six months of imports. • Finally, in view of the upward pressures on aggregate demand including pick up in investment activity, a reduction in the revenue deficit and further improvement in the fiscal deficit will add comfort to macroeconomic management. VI.  Inflation targeting Recently, there has been a proactive debate in Pakistan on alternative monetary policy frameworks - monetary targeting and nominal income targeting versus inflation targeting. Former is questioned because of an unpredictable relationship between money and nominal income and instability in the demand for money. Advocates of inflation targeting have pointed out to the substantive success across industrialized and emerging market economies of achieving a high degree of price stability. At the same time it is recognized that preconditions for adopting inflation targeting are now evolving in Pakistan, for instance there:                                                       6  Draft Paper on “Is Inflation a Fiscal Phenomenon”, Economic Policy Department, SBP. 7  Akbari, Ather H. and Randukwa, Wimal, “Inflation Targeting in a Small Emerging Market Economy: The Case of Pakistan” and Khalid, Ahmed M., “Is Inflation Targeting the Best Policy Choice for Emerging Economies ? A Survey of Emerging Market Experiences and Lessons for Pakistan.” BIS Review 55/2006 5 
(i) Exists Legal framework for central bank’s operational independence (ii) Exists Fiscal Responsibility Act which offers an opportunity to impose greater fiscal discipline (iii) Financial sector is growing and has benefited from privatization of banking system (iv) Pakistan is now exploiting domestic and international capital markets Some studies have further recommended that exchange rate would have to be factored in the inflation targeting framework not only to the extent that the inflation forecast is affected by the exchange rate, but also insofar as the SBP may need to adjust the monetary policy instruments to limit the impact of exchange rate changes on other objectives, say, external competitiveness.8There are however concerns that preconditions for Pakistan switching to inflation targeting do not exist and that commodity and import prices are a major determinant of inflation in Pakistan, rather than monetary policy. As has been discussed earlier, there is sufficient evidence and grounds that inflation is a monetary phenomenon too and this will continue to prevail more visibly as the economy further matures. Given the risks and vulnerabilities associated with emerging markets which have good growth prospects but remain prone to a series of shocks (oil prices, export prices, droughts, floods, and so on) a move towards adoption of suitably modified inflation targeting would be in order to prevent the drift in headline inflation rate, as well as their potential reverberations. It is this consideration, which is motivating SBP to launch development of appropriate data and models to assess the determinants of inflation and to be able to forecast inflation. Conclusion In the short-term, while pursuing monetary aggregate, SBP will need to maintain its monetary tightening stance and enhance its communication to influence inflation expectations, and counter concerns about the adverse effects of higher interest rates on competitiveness and/or growth. However it is important to note that monetary policy alone will not be able to contain all the rise in inflationary pressures. In particular, there is an urgent need for the government to supplement its administrative supply-side measures with policies to address market structure problems. Inflationary pressures arising from supply side factors respond more to legal and administrative measures, and are less sensitive to monetary tightening. Going forward, SBP will be launching preparatory work on inflation targeting. Among others, it will be important for SBP to explore what is an appropriate index to target, whether some components of the CPI should be systematically excluded from or added to the CPI index, what new statistics and refinements in data (including information on stock market indicators and real estate prices) might be needed for developing model and analytical framework for inflation forecasting. There will be need for introducing supportive legal and regulatory framework which allow for targeting inflation and allow greater operational independence to the central bank, while ensuring that SBP has the desired transparency and communication strategy critical for transition to an eventual adoption of inflation targeting.                                                       8  As discussed in Zaidi (2005). 6 BIS Review 55/2006 
Susan Schmidt Bies: A supervisor’s perspective on enterprise risk management  Remarks by Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Financial Women’s Association Washington Briefing, Washington DC, 12 June 2006. *      *      * Thank you for the invitation to speak here today. I am impressed by the range of interesting subjects covered in your program, and I hope that my remarks on enterprise risk management will be informative as well.  Today I will look at some recent cases in which we believe bankers and supervisors have learned some key lessons about enterprise risk management, or ERM. These lessons demonstrate how good risk management increases business efficiency and profitability. Naturally, what we've learned from the banking industry can be more broadly applied to other industries and sectors. Indeed, one could argue that ERM can improve management of many different types of entities, including government agencies and nonprofit organizations. But before I start discussing particular examples, I want to take a step back and give you my thoughts on ERM generally.  General thoughts on enterprise risk management The financial services industry continues to evolve to meet the challenges posed by emerging technologies and business processes, new financial instruments, the growing scale and scope of financial institutions, and changing regulatory frameworks. The Federal Reserve, as the supervisor of state member banks and bank and financial holding companies, has been working with other regulators and financial institutions to improve the effectiveness and relevance of regulation and supervision in this changing environment. The Federal Reserve has long emphasized the need for appropriate and strong internal controls in institutions we supervise, and we have taken a continuous-improvement approach to our risk-focused examinations. For many years, enterprise risk management across multiple organizational units within an entity has received increased scrutiny.  In some cases, firms may be practicing good risk management on an exposure-by-exposure basis, but they may not be paying close enough attention to aggregation of exposures across the entire organization. Rapid growth can place considerable pressure on, among other areas, an organization's management information systems, change-management controls, strategic planning, credit concentrations, and asset/liability management. An organization must also understand how its various business components, some of which can be quite sophisticated and complex, dynamically interact. A successful ERM process can help an organization to meet many of these challenges.  Of course, enterprise risk management is a fairly broad topic that can mean different things to different people. For our purposes here today, I will define ERM as a process that enables management to effectively deal with uncertainty and associated risk and opportunity, enhancing the capacity to build stakeholder value. Borrowing from ERM literature, I would say that ERM includes  • aligning the entity's risk appetite and strategies,  • enhancing the rigor of the entity's risk-response decisions,  • reducing the frequency and severity of operational surprises and losses,  • identifying and managing multiple and cross-enterprise risks,  • proactively seizing on the opportunities presented to the entity, and  • improving the effectiveness of the entity's capital deployment.  Some of you are probably familiar with the ERM framework published over a year ago by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or COSO. The COSO framework provides a useful way to look at ERM and helps generate further discussion.  In the COSO framework, ERM consists of eight interrelated components derived from the way management runs an enterprise and integrated with the management process: (1) internal environment, (2) objective setting, (3) event identification, (4) risk assessment, (5) risk response, (6) BIS Review 55/2006 1 
control activities, (7) information and communication, and (8) monitoring. Each of these is described in more detail in the COSO literature.  Notably, the COSO framework states explicitly that, while its components will not function identically within every entity, its principles should apply to all sizes of institutions. Small and mid-size entities, for example, may choose to apply the framework in a less formal and less structured way and scale it to their own needs - as long as quality is maintained. This underscores the message from bank supervisors that good risk management is expected of every institution, regardless of size or sophistication. Naturally, there will still be some tension between what supervisors expect and what bankers do, but we hope that supervisory expectations for risk management are becoming more and more aligned with the way that bankers run their businesses.  I would now like to discuss a few recent examples from banking that highlight the importance of ERM. With the benefit of hindsight, the financial regulators and the industry have been trying to distill the lessons learned from these recent breakdowns in risk management and internal control in the financial services sector.  Compliance risk One area in which ERM provides tangible value is the area of compliance risk, which can be defined as the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to an organization's reputation and franchise value. This type of risk may arise when an organization fails to comply with the laws, regulations, or codes of conduct that are applicable to its business activities and functions. The Federal Reserve expects banking organizations to have in place an infrastructure that can identify, monitor, and effectively control the compliance risks that they face. Needless to say, the infrastructure should be commensurate with the nature of the organization's compliance risk. For a large complex banking organization, dealing with compliance risk can be particularly challenging unless it has a well-developed risk-management program.  To create appropriate compliance-risk controls, organizations should first understand compliance risk across the entire entity. Understandably, this can be a daunting task, but I think most would agree that an effective risk assessment is critical. Managers should be expected to evaluate the risks and controls within their scope of authority at least annually.  An enterprise-wide compliance-risk management program should be dynamic and proactive. It should constantly assess evolving risks when new business lines or activities are added, when existing activities and processes are altered or when there are regulatory changes. The process should include an assessment of how those changes may affect the level and nature of risk exposures, and whether mitigating controls are effective in limiting exposures to targeted levels. To avoid having a program that operates on autopilot, an organization must continuously reassess its risks and controls and communicate with all employees who are part of the compliance process. If compliance is seen as a one-off project, an organization risks facing a situation down the road where its compliance program has not kept up with the changes in its organization. Also, the board of directors needs to ensure the organization has a top-to-bottom compliance culture that is well communicated by senior management so that all staff members understand their compliance responsibilities. Clear lines of communication and authority help to avoid conflicts of interest.  Compliance-risk management can be more difficult for management to integrate into an organization's regular business processes because it often reflects mandates set out by legislation or regulation that the organization itself does not view as key to its success. For example, bankers understand how vital credit-risk management and interest-rate risk management are to their organizations, because they reduce the volatility of earnings and limit losses. However, regulations enacted for broader societal purposes can be viewed as an expensive mandate. For example, the Patriot Act requires significant reporting of transactions to the government, and many in industry have expressed frustration about the burden associated with such reporting. I can assure you, we recognize banking organizations' investment in and commitment to compliance with regulatory requirements, including those imposed by anti-money-laundering and counter-terrorism regulations. The Federal Reserve will continue to work with our counterparts in the federal government to encourage enhanced feedback on how reporting is contributing to our common fight against money laundering and terrorism.  2 BIS Review 55/2006 
Operational risk Over the past few years, the Federal Reserve has been increasing its focus on operational risk. For many nonfinancial organizations, the largest share of enterprise risk is likely to be operational risk, as opposed to credit and interest-rate risk. Banks have learned much from the practices that nonfinancial firms have developed over the years. Operational risk has more relevance today for bankers largely because they are able to shed much of their interest-rate and credit risk through sales of loans, use of financial derivatives and sound models to manage the risks that are retained. Further, the revenue streams that are growing the fastest are increasingly related to transaction processing, servicing accounts, and selling sophisticated financial products. To be successful, organizations must have complex systems to execute these activities.  Banks are also utilizing advanced models to estimate and manage credit-risk and market-risk exposures. Growing use of sophisticated models requires stronger risk-management practices since weaknesses in the models' operational design and data integrity can lead to significant losses. Thus, effective risk management requires financial institutions to have more-knowledgeable employees to identify system requirements, monitor their effectiveness, and interpret model results appropriately. We have learned quite a bit about operational risk from our examinations of banking organizations. For example, during routine examinations we look at the adequacy of banks' procedures, processes, and internal controls. Such reviews include transaction testing of control routines in higher-risk activities. For example, a bank's wire transfer activities and loan administration functions are often targeted for review, and our experiences have identified some common weaknesses in operational control that are worthy of attention.  With wire transfers and similar transactions, a banking organization could suffer a significant financial loss from unauthorized transfers and incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risks are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from our reviews are to (1) establish reasonable approval and authorization requirements for wire transactions to ensure that an appropriate level of management is aware of the transaction and to establish better accountability; (2) establish call-back procedures, passwords, funds transfer agreements, and other authentication controls related to customers' wire transfer requests; and (3) pay increased attention to authentication controls, since this area may also be particularly susceptible to external fraud.  Loan administration is another area where banking organizations could suffer significant financial losses from inappropriate segregation of duties or lack of dual controls. An institution could also incur considerable damage to its reputation if operational risk factors are not properly mitigated. A few recurring recommendations from these types of reviews that may be applied to corporations more generally are to (1) ensure that loan officers do not have the ability to book and maintain their own loans; (2) confine employee access to only those loan system computer applications that are consistent with their responsibilities; and (3) provide line staff with consistent guidance, in the form of policies and procedures, on how to identify and handle unusual transactions.  Operational risk arising in recent financial restatements Risks can sometimes quickly appear where they were not traditionally expected. For example, consider the changes we have seen in financial reporting quality of corporations in all industries. In 2005, there were approximately 1,200 restatements of previously filed financial statements by publicly traded companies - twice the rate for 2004. The complexity of generally accepted accounting principles and a more stringent, literal interpretation of the application of those standards by auditors and regulatory bodies, primarily the Securities and Exchange Commission, are two major factors that have led to the restatements.  Examples of prominent restatements include FAS 133 hedge accounting and lease accounting issues. In the area of hedge accounting, the restatements generally resulted from the misapplication of the "short-cut" method. The organizations in question did not satisfy all of the criteria for use of the short-cut method but, nonetheless, utilized hedge accounting treatment allowed by this method. In the area of lease accounting issues, most companies simply failed to apply longstanding accounting standards related to revenue recognition reserves, accruals and contingencies, and equity accounting. Most companies believed they were actually reporting correctly prior to the restatements. Virtually all of these companies were audited by auditing firms that are now registered with the Public Company BIS Review 55/2006 3 
Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). The PCAOB's inspection process, which involves close scrutiny of registered firms, may be a factor in the increased number of restatements.  Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires each annual report of a public company to include a report by management on the company's internal control over financial reporting. Restatements by banking organizations alone resulted in the revision of a number of material weaknesses in internal control for the 2004 reporting period, fifty-two from the thirty-seven originally reported. This increase implies a significant amount of operational risk associated with the accounting process.  Generally, examiners review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has a clear understanding of the roles of the audit committee, management, internal audit, and the external auditor and whether the organization has implemented an effective plan to achieve the objectives and requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley 404. Examiners also review the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process to determine whether the organization has an effective follow-up strategy for the remediation of significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. Examiners are encouraged to utilize the results of the Sarbanes-Oxley 404 process, where possible, in their overall assessment of the organization's risk-management and control process and in the risk scoping of safety-and-soundness examinations and inspections.  Information security Issues involving information security and identity theft have received quite a bit of attention from the federal government over the past several years. In fact, just recently, President Bush signed an executive order that created an Identity Theft Task Force for the purpose of strengthening federal efforts to protect against identity theft. The heads of the federal bank regulatory agencies are designated members of this task force; and as supervisors of financial institutions, I believe we can offer a unique perspective on this issue. As you have probably noticed, cyber attacks and security breaches involving nonpublic customer information appear in the headlines almost every week. These events have cost the financial services industry millions of dollars in direct losses and have done considerable reputational damage. The cost of identity theft to affected consumers is also significant. With banking organizations increasingly using the Internet to interact with customers, business partners, and service providers, concerns about the use of the Internet as a communication and delivery channel have resulted in the need for and use of more-sophisticated control mechanisms, such as enterprise-wide firewall protections, multifactor authentication schemes, and virtual private-network connections.  While many of the widely publicized information security breaches have involved parties outside the affected banking organization accessing the organization's customer information, organizations also remain at risk for breaches or misuses of information by an insider. During our examination activities, we have seen breakdowns in internal control, resulting in operating losses that were traced back to weak controls over insiders' access to information technology systems interfacing with electronic funds transfer networks. Further investigation into these situations suggests that the duration and magnitude of the fraud and resulting losses is a direct function of the internal party's access to accounting and related systems.  Several lessons have emerged. First, institutions should tightly control logical access to funds transfer systems and ensure that access settings enforce separation of duties, dual controls, and management sign-offs. Second, an institution's senior management should be restricted from regular access to business-line functional systems, especially funds transfer systems. When such restriction is impractical, additional controls must be in place and functioning effectively. Finally, effective management of information security risk, even when focused on a specific function, requires an enterprise-wide approach to yield a true and complete evaluation of the associated risks.  Mutual funds Well-publicized instances of late trading and market timing at mutual fund firms, and the related investigations, have involved many businesses, including banking, securities, and insurance firms. These types of breakdowns in internal control result in sanctions or financial loss and adversely affect a firm's reputation and franchise value.  4 BIS Review 55/2006 
I would like to highlight a few lessons learned from our experience in investigating control breaches in these mutual fund cases. One of the most obvious is the need to critically evaluate unusual client relationships that require variances from standard procedures. If a high percentage of compensation is derived from a single client, a red flag should immediately go up. Also, organizations should have a formal process for reviewing and approving unique products, customers, and services at the inception of the client relationship. Furthermore, it is always a good idea to shine some light on areas historically labeled "low risk" to validate that assessment. The low occurrence of loss from an activity should not be the only factor considered when assessing risk.  Finally, compensation systems that reward employees for sales without adequately monitoring their internal control breaches can create a conflict between the interest of employees and the interest of the enterprise. As companies move away from straight salaries to more incentive-based systems, it is important that personnel departments be included in an effective enterprise-wide risk-management program to consider how changes in compensation practices affect risks to the enterprise.  Credit derivatives I would now like to turn to one more issue that has relevance to ERM, and that is the importance of companies including an ERM perspective as they design and build new lines of business. As many of you might know, last year a dialogue between supervisors and credit derivatives dealers was initiated to support industry efforts to address weaknesses in the operations surrounding credit default swaps (CDS). While we view these new instruments as an effective way to diversify and mitigate risks related to credit exposures from corporations, an industry-led study, the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group II report, identified significant weaknesses in the infrastructure supporting sales and risk monitoring of these instruments. While the report identified forty-seven recommendations, regulators in the United States and other countries have focused on two major weaknesses.  One weakness relates to the lack of discipline in enforcing contract terms. Any time an instrument is traded over the counter, it is important to know with whom you are doing business. Since an exchange does not stand between the two sides of the trade, parties make payments directly to each other to honor the terms of the contracts. The market practice is to use collateral or pricing to mitigate the risk that the other side of the trade cannot perform according to the agreement. The recent industry study also found that competitive pressures were such that brokers were not enforcing the standard CDS agreement, because their counterparties were routinely assigning the trade to another party without the broker's prior consent. As a result, dealers often did not have a real-time understanding of the counterparty exposure. Obviously, this can significantly change the risk profile of a transaction and also make it very difficult to settle payments in a timely manner.  Another weakness is related to the success of the product. Trading volume has grown so quickly and reached such a significant level that broker-dealers' paper-based systems to record the trades and document the transactions have not been able to keep up. As a result, significant backlogs of confirmations of these over-the-counter derivatives built up. This creates concerns that information feeding risk-management systems - information about the volume, term, and counterparty to the trade - is not complete. This problem would be exacerbated in a stress situation, when positions need to be changed very quickly to mitigate risk.  A few months ago, fourteen major market participants published a letter reiterating their commitment to improving the infrastructure that supports the credit derivatives markets. The market participants are committed to the development and implementation of a set of industrywide guidelines that include a targeted reduction in each market participant's confirmation backlogs and assurance that agreement terms will be enforced. Additionally, the fourteen participants will work to create a largely electronic marketplace in which all trades will be processed through an industry-accepted platform, develop a new set of processing standards for those trades that cannot be confirmed electronically, and establish a new procedure for settlement following a credit event.  We are generally pleased with both the industry's self-identification of the issues and its commitment to making improvements. But for purposes of our discussion of ERM today, the problems surrounding CDS sales highlight the challenges risk managers face when market pressures make the firm's line management reluctant to initiate appropriate controls on their own. It also illustrates that in new lines of business, sometimes ERM must go outside the enterprise and work with competitors to support the growth of shared systems and standards to mitigate risks.  BIS Review 55/2006 5 
Conclusion At the Federal Reserve, we believe that all banking organizations need good risk management. An enterprise-wide approach is appropriate for setting objectives across the organization, instilling an enterprise-wide culture, and ensuring that key activities and risks are being monitored regularly. In many ways, bankers have learned from nonfinancial industries about ERM. In other cases, banks' application of ERM may hold lessons for entities outside the financial sector. Whichever the case, it is clear that there is always an opportunity to improve upon ERM strategies and maintain the proper discipline to implement them effectively.  6 BIS Review 55/2006 
Timothy F Geithner: Uncertainty and transparency in the conduct of monetary policy  Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Financial Services Leadership Forum Breakfast, New York City, 31 May 2006. *      *      * At the Jackson Hole Symposium in 2003, Alan Greenspan remarked that "uncertainty is not just an important feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape." Historically, this pervasive uncertainty was associated with a tendency toward opacity on the part of central bankers. But in recent years we've seen a rather dramatic reversal in this tendency as central bankers have come to recognize the potentially valuable role that communication with financial markets and the general public can play in the achievement of monetary policy goals.  While transparency has emerged as one of the hallmarks of modern central banking, so too has an appreciation for the challenge of communicating about policy under uncertainty. This challenge can be substantial. It means conveying not only the most likely trajectory for key economic variables, but also the uncertainty around that trajectory and perhaps some indication of how policy might react under the myriad ways that the uncertainty could be resolved. I want to devote my remarks today to exploring what it means, and what it does not mean, for a central bank to communicate in an effective way about policy in the face of uncertainty. The issue of communication is particularly relevant in the current economic environment. For much of the past three years, financial markets have reflected a high degree of certainty about the near-term outlook for monetary policy in the United States. Market expectations in the weeks preceding each of the last 16 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings attached a probability close to one that the FOMC would raise the target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Also, there was very little probability attached to inter-meeting moves over this period, or to moves in increments larger than 25 basis points. And, although market expectations about how far the FOMC would ultimately move were revised significantly over the course of this period as the economic outlook was revised, these changes occurred without the Committee needing to deviate from the near-term path. This period of unusual certainty in the path of the fed funds rate was the result of a confluence of factors. When the Committee first moved to tighten policy in June 2004, the fed funds rate was at the historic low of 1 percent, and it was clear that policy would have to move a substantial distance to get back within the range of plausible estimates of the neutral rate. Over the course of the following months the incoming data tended to reinforce the case for a progressive move up in the target rate. And, the Committee made a conscious decision to signal that in view of the likely path of growth and inflation further tightening of monetary policy was necessary and could be achieved at a relatively gradual pace. We are now in the process of emerging from this rather exceptional period, and this provides us with an interesting context in which to reflect on uncertainty and how it affects the conduct of monetary policy and communications about monetary policy. The degree of confidence in the sign and shape of the near-term path of the fed funds rate we've seen in recent years is unlikely to be a common feature of monetary policy in the United States or in other countries. The simple reason for this is that the economic circumstances that precipitated the policy were also not typical. There are likely to be times when incoming data deviates substantially and persistently from our forecasts. In those situations, policymakers have to examine whether they have significantly misestimated certain fundamental features of the economy, such as the NAIRU or the trend productivity growth rate, that might alter the appropriate course of monetary policy. Central banks everywhere conduct policy in a state of limited knowledge about the economy and how best to achieve their objectives. The sources of uncertainty they confront are many and varied. Sometimes, what we think we know about how the economy works turns out to be wrong, either because certain features of the economy have changed, or because our understanding was not right in the first place. It was once widely held that monetary policy could achieve somewhat lower rates of unemployment by allowing somewhat higher rates of inflation, and that it could do this without risking a BIS Review 54/2006 1 
substantial acceleration of inflation. This view proved to be mistaken because it did not correctly account for the role inflation expectations played in inflation dynamics. Economic concepts that are critical to our understanding of the economy may be difficult or impossible to capture in practice. One such concept is the neutral or equilibrium interest rate, which is the rate that, if sustained over some period of time, is likely to be consistent with an economy growing at potential with low inflation. Plausible estimates for the prevailing level of this rate have a range of at least 100 basis points, and the center of the estimates tends to move around quite a bit. Another concept that is difficult to estimate precisely is the economy's potential, or sustainable, growth rate. The acceleration in productivity growth in the United States in the late 1990s, for example, led us to revise our estimates of how fast the economy was likely to be able to grow at that time without undermining price stability. We also face considerable ignorance about the precise channels through which policy actions ultimately affect the economy, as well as how long those effects will take to show up and how large they will be when they do show up. As you would expect, this makes it difficult to assess in advance, or even in real time, the amount of loosening or tightening that is likely to be necessary to achieve the goals of central banks. Even if we had precise knowledge of key economic relationships, our ability to assess economic conditions in real time would be impeded by data limitations. Though most modern central banks implicitly or explicitly target some measure of inflation, the host of issues surrounding the proper definition and measurement of inflation for policy purposes is daunting. In general, most economic data are subject to sampling error and so cannot simply be taken at face value. Also, many of the series we rely on are subject to revision as more or better information becomes available, and potentially can even be redefined in a way that makes the history of the series less useful for interpreting current movements. Finally, data are often reported with a significant enough delay to limit their use as a read on current conditions. But, even if we knew the model and data with certainty, it is impossible to perfectly predict the evolution of factors that are largely beyond the influence of current monetary policy but that would likely affect our policy today if we knew for sure how they would look tomorrow. One way to say this is that we simply cannot know what types of "shocks" are likely to hit the economy or when they will hit. And even as they impact the economy, the appropriate policy response may not be obvious because it may be difficult to assess in real time the probable duration of the shock and whether it is demand driven or supply driven. Even at a one-year horizon, which for policy purposes is not a very long time, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding forecasts of GDP growth. For example, the Survey of Professional Forecasters reports that on average 50 economists attach a 90 percent probability to an outcome for real GDP growth for 2007 that ranges from 1.0 percent to 5.0 percent. The width of this band of confidence or uncertainty is similar to that in the published forecasts of many central banks. The types of fundamental uncertainty I just reviewed are always present, but their impact on the appropriate near-term trajectory of rates, and hence on the degree of confidence the central bank can convey about that trajectory, may vary substantially over time. I want to mention a few other concrete examples of the uncertainty we currently face. The latest wave of global economic integration has influenced inflation and output dynamics around the world in ways that may be hard to understand fully in real time. Technological progress, along with the transition to greater labor force participation in emerging and developing economies has probably served to keep inflation low in many other countries and has served to increase the rate of growth in potential output globally. But the rapid growth in the market sectors of emerging and developing economies may also contribute to more rapid growth in global demand and inflation pressures. This changing configuration of world markets complicates the task of forecasting inflation and output within national economies. Energy prices have surprised us over the past few years, in terms of the extent of the rise in prices, the increase in volatility, and the limited negative effects to date on global economic growth. Our capacity to project future energy prices has proven to be very limited, as has our ability to convincingly ascertain the extent to which temporary supply factors, rather than an unrecognized strength in global demand, accounts for the energy price trajectory we've witnessed recently. The consequences of these limits to our knowledge may be even greater given the extent of the price increases already experienced. 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
The unprecedented level of the U.S. current account deficit and dramatic rise in U.S. indebtedness adds to the normal degree of uncertainty that surrounds any medium-term forecast because of the dynamics that could accompany the path to a more sustainable pattern of capital flows. The process of adjustment that appears to be underway in the U.S. housing market, occurring as it is after a sustained and very substantial decline in the household savings rate, provides more than the usual challenge in predicting the future strength of consumer spending. It is also hard to assess the degree to which the current constellation of global monetary conditions has influenced the behavior of long-term interest rates. This makes it harder to assess the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy. And it may also mask some of the pressures on risk premiums we might expect to see given the deterioration of the U.S. long-term fiscal situation and the magnitude of the U.S. current account imbalance. In reviewing these dimensions of uncertainty, I want to emphasize that the fundamental conditions of the U.S. economy, and much of the world economy, are very strong today. But these aspects of uncertainly help illustrate what makes monetary policy interesting, and they help explain why central banks may confront wide bands of uncertainty around even a strong central outlook. They also emphasize the importance of the process we use to make decisions about policy in a state of limited knowledge. Policymakers can use a range of approaches to deal with uncertainty. In addition to making a very substantial investment in trying to capture changes in economic activity that may not be fully evident in the national data, we typically spend a lot of time looking at the assumptions that underpin the central forecast, and the sensitivity of that forecast to the possibility that those assumptions prove wrong. We regularly and systematically examine a range of alternative scenarios that attempt to capture a broad range of different paths for the main forces operating on the economy. These scenarios include those that seem highly implausible but might prove very damaging, as well as those that seem more plausible but might alter the outlook less. To complement this, we look at the implications for monetary policy of alternative scenarios for the outlook—what should we do if the world moves in a different direction. And we also look at the impact on the outlook for growth and inflation of different paths for the fed funds rate. These approaches help illustrate the size and sources of uncertainty we live with at any moment. They do not give us the capacity to attach precise probabilities to alternative scenarios or to quantify with precision the implications, but they help frame a discussion of the material risks to the outlook and the potential consequences of different types of policy mistakes. And they can help inform choices about how central banks should affect expectations about future interest rates. Along with these analytical tools, many central banks have adopted a decisionmaking structure that is designed to bring a diversity of independent perspectives to the table. Although the FOMC's discussions begin with the presentation of a forecast prepared by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board, the committee members bring to the discussion substantial information based on independent efforts to understand the underlying dynamics of demand and inflation and their implications for monetary policy. This can provide a stronger foundation for decisions, particularly where uncertainty is inherently great. Central banks have adopted different approaches to this challenge, even as there has been broad convergence toward the model of independent central banks, with explicit mandates that include price stability and greater disclosure and transparency. The central banks that publish quantitative forecasts for growth and inflation now typically show the confidence bands around their forecasts. In some cases, these forecasts use, as a conditioning assumption, financial market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates. In others, the central bank publishes a forecast that includes the central bank's assessment at that time of the likely path of monetary policy over some horizon. In the former case, the implications of the forecast for monetary policy are left implicit. In the latter case, the likely path of monetary policy is made explicit, but that path is heavily qualified or conditioned to make it clear that that expected path of short-term interest rates will change as conditions change. The FOMC's approach to communication differs in interesting and important ways from these other models. Although the Committee has introduced a gradual but marked increase in the degree of communication over the past two decades, it provides information about its forecast in quantitative terms less frequently and with less detail than has become typical of many other central banks. And BIS Review 54/2006 3 
yet, because of the unique circumstances over the past two to three years, it has provided more information about the near-term path for monetary policy than has been the practice of many of our counterparts. These differences in approaches to communication do not seem to reflect fundamental differences in perceptions of the degree or nature of uncertainty. The proponents of the regimes with the most explicit forecasts and greater disclosure about the future path of interest rates do not claim to have greater confidence in their ability to forecast. They do express, however, greater comfort with some of the potentially adverse consequences of such approaches, the tendency, for example, for observers to gravitate toward the central tendency of the forecast and to look past the uncertainty bands and qualifications. And they express less concern that these approaches to communication will end up limiting the flexibility of central banks to react as circumstances change without inducing damaging volatility into markets. And so, even as central banks have moved in varying degrees toward greater clarity about their goals, forecasts and policy decisions, they have also moved to being more explicit about uncertainty and about the need for flexibility in how policy should adjust over time. This reflects an evolving appreciation that there are limits to transparency. Transparency in monetary policy cannot mean that the central bank conveys more confidence in the outlook for growth and inflation than it can reasonably have, and it cannot provide more assurance about the likely future course of policy than it actually has. This seems self evident. And yet as central banks have moved to communicating more and disclosing more about monetary policy, transparency in monetary policy has been associated with rising expectations for clarity about the path of target interest rates over time. It might seem desirable in an ideal state of the world for expectations in financial markets about the future course of policy to closely track in real time those of the central bank. But given the degree of uncertainty that surrounds monetary policy making, this is unlikely to be possible, except in special circumstances. There will be circumstances when it is appropriate for the central bank to send a signal about the target rate that extends well beyond the immediate horizon. These circumstances are not likely to arise frequently, and will be appropriate in particular conditions when the benefits afforded by the effect on expectations clearly outweigh the cost imposed by the loss to flexibility. Central banks should be clear about what they are trying to achieve. They should be open with the knowledge and insight they possess. And they should provide the public with clarity where it is attainable. But they also need to convey the limits to their knowledge and avoid providing a sense of certainty they do not, or cannot, possess. Uncertainty strengthens the case for being open about what we do not know, and exploring the robustness of our decisions to a range of alternative scenarios. But uncertainty also reinforces the case for clarity in communications about the objectives that guide policy and the rationale for our decisions. Perhaps most crucially, this means preserving confidence in our commitment to keep underlying inflation low over time, and for retaining the capacity to respond with flexibility to the challenges we face in this uncertain world. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 54/2006 
Guy Quaden: Review of significant events in 2005 Introductory speech by Mr Guy Quaden, Governor of the National Bank of Belgium, at the Ordinary General Meeting of the National Bank of Belgium, Brussels, 27 March 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues on the Board of Directors, on the occasion of this ordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the National Bank of Belgium. I also hope that this meeting can proceed smoothly and enable us to answer, in a calmer atmosphere than last year, the questions which you have submitted to us and any others that you raise. We want to answer as many questions as possible, but reasonably quickly and in an orderly way. In particular, this meeting is not the place to answer questions concerning the legal actions which are still pending before the courts, nor questions which do not concern the past financial year. As last year, I would like to give you a brief account of the most significant events in the year under review, before handing over to the Vice-Governor who will present and comment on the annual accounts for 2005. Various new projects entrusted to the Bank by the public authorities and the economic agents in general bear witness to the confidence which Belgian society as a whole continues to place in our institution. The principal project concerns the future of the means of payment. In 2004, the Ministers of Finance, Economic Affairs and Consumer Protection commissioned the Bank to organise a national dialogue on the efficiency of the payment systems in Belgium. To that end, the Bank set up a Steering Committee on the future of the means of payment, with representatives from all the parties concerned. In 2005, that Steering Committee published two reports: the first concerns the costs, advantages and disadvantages of the various means of payment, and the second deals with the modernisation of the payment channels used by the public authorities. This Steering Committee has yet to address the question of the transition to the Single Euro Payments Area, in which the payment systems of various countries will be integrated, augmenting the efficiency of cross-border payments. The establishment of synergies between the Bank and the CBFA, provided for by the law of 2 August 2002 on the supervision of the financial sector and on financial services, has continued, particularly in regard to financial stability, IT systems and crisis management. However, the only way of fulfilling the ultimate goal of the reform is by fostering still closer links and the spirit of cooperation, with due respect for the powers of each institution and the specific character of their respective areas of activity. For our institution, the year 2004 had featured a new strategic review of the future of its activities. In 2005, that review led to the adoption of master plans which define the future pattern of activities and employment at the Bank. Those plans provide a stable medium-term framework up to the year 2009. For the Bank, it is a question of working within the Eurosystem, adopting a more selective approach with increasing specialisation, maintaining cost control and continuing to improve the quality of the services provided for the community. * * * The progress of the various activities in 2005 is set out in the annual report which has been sent to you and which is also available on our website. In addition, that document contains the annual accounts for the year and describes the governance of our enterprise. A number of questions have been sent to us by shareholders, particularly by the Deminor company, on the subject of the Bank’s corporate governance statement. Why does it not conform to the Lippens code when the Bank is a listed company, and why does it not explain, for each of the code’s provisions, the reasons for not conforming to it? First, it must be remembered that the special legal framework governing our institution and its specific position as a central bank mean that we cannot systematically compare its governance with the “Lippens Code” recommendations. The Belgian corporate governance code, which supplements the ordinary legislation on listed companies, itself affirms the code’s character as a recommendation. It cannot replace the existing laws and treaties, particularly those applicable to the Bank. The Bank is in fact governed first by the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, and then by its Organic Law and its own BIS Review 54/2006 1 
Statutes, and finally – on a purely additional basis – by the companies code. The Bank is therefore not subject to the same legal rules as other public limited liability companies. Furthermore, the Lippens code is inappropriate to the special characteristics of the Bank, a company which – unlike other listed companies - does not aim primarily to maximise its profit, but which, in accordance with the Treaty and the law, promotes monetary and financial stability in the public interest. It is the dominance of the public interest that caused the legislature to determine the composition and powers of the Bank’s organs. These are different from those of the companies addressed by the Belgian governance code. While the organs of conventional companies are the administrative board, the general meeting and, perhaps the management board or chief executive, the organs of the Bank are the Governor, the Board of Directors, the Council of Regency and the Board of Censors. The special arrangements for the appointment of the members of these organs, the specific composition and role of the Council of Regency, and the provisions for the exercise of supervision are all examples of the way in which the dominance of the public interest is reflected in the Bank’s special governance structure. This is also the explanation for the quite specific role of the Belgian State, which is involved both as a shareholder and as a sovereign State. It is because it acts primarily as a sovereign State that it granted the Bank the right of issue and has a priority right to the resulting profits. However, the National Bank has always been scrupulous in ensuring compliance with the ethical principles and values underlying the Belgian corporate governance code. It can be said that the system of governance and control imposed on us is just as exacting as that recommended by the Belgian corporate governance code, and in some respects even more so. In fact, as a member of the European System of Central Banks, the Bank is subject to special rules and obligations which do not apply to any other Belgian companies. Moreover, I feel that there are few companies which publish such detailed information as that contained in Part 2 of the Bank’s annual report, which you have all received and which is available on the Bank’s website. That demonstrates our desire to act correctly in providing all possible information for the public, and more particularly for our shareholders, on the operation of our institution. * * * As in 2003 and 2004, the judgments handed down in 2005 and early 2006 following the legal actions brought by certain shareholders found in favour of the Bank. Thus, on 27 October 2005, the Brussels Commercial Court confirmed, as the Court of Arbitration had already done in 2003, that the Bank has not lost its right of issue and that it therefore does not have to liquidate its reserve fund. Since the start of monetary union, the Bank has in fact shared the right to issue euro banknotes with the European Central Bank and the eleven other national central banks of the Eurosystem. A second judgment passed on 2 February 2006, again by the Brussels Commercial Court, concerned a write-back from the provision for future foreign exchange losses, effected at the end of the 2003 financial year and intended to adjust the amount of the provision in line with the change in the currency risk. The amount of that write-back was included in the Bank’s financial income shared between the Bank and the State. The Brussels Commercial Court rejected the demand made by certain shareholders to cancel that decision, and confirmed that the annual accounts for 2003 were perfectly legal. In helping to clarify the status of our institution and shed light on its special characteristics, these court decisions should put an end to certain arguments and reduce the fluctuations in the Bank’s share price. In the foreword to the Annual Report, when I mention unjustified speculation concerning these shares, I mean that these fluctuations originated because of legal arguments which we consider to be incorrect, and which the judgments so far have also refuted. * * * In 2005, the Bank’s profits improved, mainly as a result of the increase in the amount of euro banknotes in circulation (+15 p.c.), and hence the increase in the Bank’s share of that issue. This expanded the volume of interest-earning assets held as the counterpart to the banknotes, and therefore increased the income which these assets generate. Moreover, the Bank earned a higher rate of interest on its dollar investments and did not have to constitute provisions, as it did in 2004, to cover losses incurred by the ECB. The improvement in the return on the assets meant that the State was once again able to receive seigniorage income. It is in return for the right of issue which the State has granted the Bank that the 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
State is entitled to the part of the income from the net interest-earning assets which exceeds 3 p.c. of those assets. The dividend paid to shareholders is, as usual, increasing in line with inflation.  Thank you for your attention. I will now hand you over to the Vice-Governor for the detailed presentation of the annual accounts for 2005; it is the accounts that constitute the most important information for the general meeting and which have, as in previous years, given rise to the largest number of questions from shareholders.

Shyamala Gopinath: Approach to Basel II Keynote address by Ms Shyamala Gopinath, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the IBA briefing session on "Emerging Paradigms in Risk Management", Bangalore, 12 May 2006.  The assistance of Shri K Damodaran in preparing this address is gratefully acknowledged. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, it is my pleasure to be here at this program on emerging paradigms in risk management. As expected of me, in my address today, I intend to share with you the broad contours of the regulatory approach, process and thinking in regard to some of the issues arising in context of Basel II. Basel II aims to encourage the use of modern risk management techniques; and to encourage banks to ensure that their risk management capabilities are commensurate with the risks of their business. Previously, regulators' main focus was on credit risk and market risk. Basel II takes a more sophisticated approach to credit risk, in that it allows banks to make use of internal ratings based Approach - or "IRB Approach" as they have become known - to calculate their capital requirement for credit risk. It also introduces, in addition to the market risk capital charge, an explicit capital charge for operational risk. Together, these three risks - credit, market, and operational risk - are the so-called "Pillar 1" risks. Banks' risk management functions need to look at a much wider range of risks than this - interest rate risk in the banking book, foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk, business cycle risk, reputation risk, strategic risk. The risk management role of helping identify, evaluate, monitor, manage and control or mitigate these risks has become a crucial role in modern-day banking. Indeed, it is probably not exaggerating the importance of this to say that the quality of a bank's risk management has become one of the key determinants of a success of a bank. The policy approach to Basel II in India is to conform to best international standards and in the process emphasis is on harmonization with the international best practices. Commercial banks in India will start implementing Basel II with effect from March 31, 2007 though, as indicated by Governor, a marginal stretching beyond this date cannot be ruled out in view of latest indications of the state of preparedness. Though the Basel II framework provides various options for implementation, special attention was given to the differences in degrees of sophistication and development of the banking system while considering these options and it was decided that banks in India will initially adopt the Standardised Approach (SA) for credit risk and the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for operational risk. The prime considerations while deciding on the likely approach included the cost of implementation and the cost of compliance.  Before coming to specifics I may like to mention that overall capital is what makes financial systems stable. In general, expected losses are to be covered by earnings and provision and hence the need to price risk appropriately. Unexpected losses or losses beyond the normal range of expectations need have to be met by capital.  Let me briefly review the steps taken for implementation of Basel II and the emerging issues.  • The RBI had announced in its annual policy statement in May 2004 that banks in India should examine in depth the options available under Basel II and draw a road-map by end-December 2004 for migration to Basel II and review the progress made at quarterly intervals.  • The Reserve Bank organized a two-day seminar in July 2004 mainly to sensitise the Chief Executive Officers of banks to the opportunities and challenges emerging from the Basel II norms.  • Soon thereafter all banks were advised in August 2004 to undertake a self-assessment of the various risk management systems in place, with specific reference to the three major risks covered under the Basel II and initiate necessary remedial measures to update the systems to match up to the minimum standards prescribed under the New Framework.  • Banks were also advised to formulate and operationalise the Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (CAAP) as required under Pillar II of the New Framework. BIS Review 54/2006 1 
• Reserve Bank issued a Guidance Note on operational risk management in November 2005, which serves as a benchmark for banks to establish a scientific operational risk management framework. • We have tried to ensure that the banks have suitable risk management framework oriented towards their requirements dictated by the size and complexity of business, risk philosophy, market perceptions and the expected level of capital.  • Risk Based Supervision (RBS) in 23 banks has been introduced on a pilot basis. • As per normal practice, and with a view to ensuring migration to Basel II in a non-disruptive manner, a consultative and participative approach had been adopted for both designing and implementing Basel II. A Steering Committee comprising senior officials from 14 banks (public, private and foreign) had been constituted wherein representation from the Indian Banks’ Association and the RBI was ensured. The Steering Committee had formed sub-groups to address specific issues. On the basis of recommendations of the Steering Committee, draft guidelines to the banks on implementation of the New Capital Adequacy Framework have been issued.  • The Reserve Bank has constituted a sub group of the Steering Committee for making recommendations on the guidelines that may be required to be issued to banks with regard to the Pillar 2 aspects. The guidelines with regard to Pillar 2 aspects proposed to be issued would cover the bank level initiatives that may be required under Pillar 2. The underlying philosophy while prescribing the Basel II principles for the Indian banking sector was that this must not result in further segmentation of the sector. Accordingly, it was decided that all scheduled commercial banks in India, both big and small, shall implement the standardised approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk with effect from March 31, 2007. However, the existing three-tier structure in respect of SCBs, the cooperative banks and RRBs may continue. Currently, the commercial banks are required to maintain capital for both credit and market risks as per Basel I framework; the cooperative banks, on the second track, are required to maintain capital for credit risk as per Basel I framework and through surrogates for market risk; the Regional Rural Banks, on the third track, have a minimum capital requirement which is, however, not on par with the Basel I framework. By opting to migrate to Basel II at the basic level, the Reserve Bank has considerably reduced the Basel II compliance costs for the system. In a way, the elementary approaches which have been identified for the Indian banking system are very similar to the Basel I methodology. For instance,  a) there is no change in the methodology for computing capital charge for market risks between Basel I and Basel II;  b) the computation of capital charge for operational risk under the BIA is very simple and will not involve any compliance cost; c) the computation of capital charge for credit risk will involve compilation of information in a marginally more granular level, which is expected to be achieved with a slight re-orientation of the existing MIS. In the above circumstances, it might not be an entirely correct assessment that implementation of the elementary levels of Basel II significantly increases the cost of regulatory compliance. No doubt some additional capital would be required, but the cushion available in the system, which at present has a Capital to Risk Assets Ratio (CRAR) of over 12 per cent, provides for some comfort. The banks have also started exploring various avenues for meeting the capital requirements. The Reserve Bank has, for its part, issued policy guidelines enabling issuance of several instruments by the banks viz., innovative perpetual debt instruments, perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, redeemable cumulative preference shares and hybrid debt instruments so as to enhance their capital raising options.  With a view to have an objective assessment of the true cost of implementation of Basel II, banks would be well advised to institute an internal study to make a true assessment of the costs involved – exclusively for the elementary approaches. The informal feedback that we have from banks reflects that they do not see Basel II implementation as a ‘costly’ proposition. However, banks need to ensure that expenditure incurred by them to improve their risk management systems, IT infrastructure, core banking solutions, risk models etc. should not be included as Basel II 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
compliance costs, since these are expenses which a bank would incur even in the normal course of business to improve their efficiencies. Operational risk Operational risk was one area which was expected to increase capital requirement for the banks. The Reserve Bank had announced in July 2004 that banks in India will be adopting the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk. This was followed up with the draft guidelines for the Basel II framework in February 2005 where the methodology for computing the capital requirement under the Basic Indicator Approach was explained to banks. Even at the system level, we find that the CRAR of banks is at present well over 12 per cent. This reflects adequate cushion in the system to meet the capital requirement for operational risks, without breaching the minimum CRAR.  There is also a perception that the capital requirement for operational risk will be lower under the advanced approaches rather than under the Basic Indicator Approach. I feel that, in the absence of details of the quality of operational risk management systems in banks and their operational risk loss experience, it may not be correct for the banks to assume that adoption of the advanced approaches would result in lesser capital than under the BIA. Having addressed the specific issues on which I was supposed to 'brief', let me now turn to some other important issues.  Rating agencies In terms of Basel II requirements, national supervisors are responsible in determining whether the rating agencies meet the eligibility criteria. The criteria specified are objectivity in assessment methodology, independence from pressures, transparency, adequate disclosures, sufficient resources for high quality credit assessments and credibility. India has four rating agencies of which three are owned partly/wholly by international rating agencies. Compared to developing countries, the extent of rating penetration has been increasing every year and a large number of capital issues of companies has been rated. However, since rating is of issues and not of issuers, it is likely to result, in effect, in application of only Basel I standards for credit risks in respect of non-retail exposures. While Basel II provides some scope to extend the rating of issues to issuers, this would only be an approximation and it would be necessary for the system to move to rating of issuers. Encouraging rating of issuers would be essential in this regard.  An internal working group is examining the process for identification of the domestic credit rating agencies which would be meeting the eligibility criteria prescribed under Basel II. It is expected that by this process would be over soon and banks would be informed the details of the rating agencies which qualify. Thereafter, the borrowers are expected to approach the rating agencies for getting themselves rated, failing which banks would be constrained to assign 100% risk weight at the minimum for unrated borrowers. The Reserve Bank had invited all the four rating agencies to make a presentation on the eligibility criteria and a self assessment with regard to these criteria. The rating agencies have since made their presentations and these are under examination vis-à-vis the eligibility criteria for recognising the rating agencies, whose ratings can be used by banks for risk weighting purposes.  Migration to advanced approaches After adequate skills are developed, both by the banks and also by the supervisors, some banks may be allowed to migrate to the Internal Rating Based (IRB) Approach. The obvious corollary is that only a few banks are expected to migrate to the advanced approaches – though after some time, and not immediately. Hence, the small banks would be well advised to focus their resources on understanding the mechanics of the functioning of the elementary approaches and identify the minimum requirements that these approaches demand. It would be in their interests to take the necessary initiatives which make the implementation of the elementary approaches effective and meaningful. As a well established risk management system is a pre-requisite for implementation of advanced approaches under the New Capital Adequacy Framework, banks were required to examine the various BIS Review 54/2006 3 
options available under the Framework and lay a road-map for migration to Basel II. The feedback received from banks suggests that a few banks may be keen on implementing the advanced approaches but all are not fully equipped to do so straightaway and are, therefore, looking forward to migrate to the advanced approaches at a later date. Basel II provides that banks should be allowed to adopt / migrate to advanced approaches only with the specific approval of the supervisor, after ensuring that they meet / satisfy the minimum requirements specified in the Framework, not only at the time of adoption / migration, but on a continuing basis. [The minimum requirements to be met by banks relate to (a) internal rating system design, (b) risk rating system operations, (c) corporate governance and oversight, (d) use of internal ratings, (e) risk quantification, (f) validation of internal estimates, (g) requirements for recognition of leasing, (h) calculation of capital charges for equity exposures and (i) disclosure requirements.] Hence, it is necessary that banks desirous of adopting the advanced approaches do a stringent assessment of their compliance with the minimum requirements before they shift gears to migrate to these approaches. In this context, current non-availability of acceptable and qualitative historical data relevant to ratings, along with the related costs involved in building up and maintaining the requisite database, does influence the pace of migration to the advanced approaches available under Basel II. Banks which are internationally active should look to significantly improve their risk management systems and migrate to the advanced approaches under Basel II since they will be required to compete with the international banks which are adopting the advanced approaches. This strategy would also be relevant to other banks which are looking at adoption of the advanced approaches. As you are aware adoption of the advanced approaches might help these banks to maintain lower capital. However, it would be relevant to refer here to the inverse relationship between the capital requirements and information needs. Adoption of the advanced approaches will require adoption of superior technology and information systems which aid the banks in better data collection, support high quality data and provide scope for detailed technical analysis - which are essential for the advanced approaches. Hence, banks aiming at maintaining lower capital by adopting the advanced approaches would also have to be prepared to meet the higher information needs. While migration to the advanced approaches will basically be a business decision, I would like to mention a few things which may perhaps influence those decisions:  • Implementation of advanced approaches under Basel II will not be mandatory for small banks which are undertaking traditional banking business and have a regional or limited presence.  • Implementation of advanced approaches under Basel II should not be considered as fashionable and implementation of elementary approaches should not be considered as inferior. • Any decision to migrate to the advanced approaches should be a well deliberated, conscious decision of the bank’s Board, after taking into account, not only their capacity to compute the capital requirement under those approaches but also their capacities to sustain the bank’s risk profile and the consequent capital levels under various scenarios, especially stress scenarios.  • The preconditions for migration to the advanced approaches would include (a) well established, efficient and independent risk management framework; (b) supported by well established, efficient IT and MIS infrastructure; (c) cost benefit analysis of adoption of advanced approaches; (d) availability of appropriate skills and capacity to retain / attract such skills at all points in time; and (e) a well established, effective and independent internal control mechanism for supplementing the risk management systems. I hope the subsequent sessions would discuss in greater detail some of these issues. It is important for the sector as a whole to appreciate and internalize the basic philosophy of the Basel II, with all attendant costs and benefits.  Undoubtedly the discipline of risk management has significantly altered the ethos of the banking as an economic activity. But one point I would like to stress in conclusion is that banks should view the opportunities opened up by these complex financial instruments in the perspective of larger systemic interest. Today internationally, when market discipline is being considered an integral part of the regulatory framework, it is imperative for banks to realize that they are equal partners in ensuring financial stability; and this involves helping build up a risk management culture across all stakeholders. 4 BIS Review 54/2006 
Any distortions brought about by misalignment of risk needs and the product being offered to address the risk can only harm and arrest the development of a healthy market. BIS Review 54/2006 5 
Ben S Bernanke: Increasing economic opportunity - challenges and strategies  Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Fifteenth Congressional District of Texas’ Fifth Regional Issues Conference, Washington DC, 13 June 2006.  *      *      * I am pleased to be here to discuss some strategies for helping families, particularly lower-income families, improve their economic and financial well-being. Families today face a financial marketplace that is increasingly complex, with numerous products and service providers from which to choose. Today I will touch on several approaches for helping people of modest means take advantage of these financial opportunities while managing the risks and avoiding possible pitfalls.  Today’s financial marketplace Technological advances have dramatically transformed the provision of financial products and services in recent years. To cite just one example, the expanded use of computerized credit-scoring models, by reducing the costs of making loans and by increasing the range of assets that lenders can sell on the secondary market, has made possible the extension of credit to a larger group of borrowers. Indeed, we have seen an increasingly wide array of products being offered to consumers across a range of incomes, leading to what has been called the democratization of credit. Likewise, technological innovation has enhanced financial services, such as banking services, and increased the variety of financial products available to savers. The range of providers in consumer financial markets has also increased, with the number of nonbank entities offering credit and other financial services having risen particularly quickly. For example, a recent study of alternative providers of financial services found the number of nonbank check-cashing establishments doubled in the United States between 1996 and 2001.1 Payday lending outlets, a source of credit that was almost non-existent a decade ago, now number more than 10,000. And data from the Survey of Consumers Finances, a triennial survey sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board, indicate that the share of households with a loan from a finance company increased from 13 percent in 1992 to 25 percent in 2004.  Financial challenges of lower-income families Despite the increased complexity of financial products and the wider availability of credit in many forms, U.S. households overall have been managing their personal finances well. On average, debt burdens appear to be at manageable levels, and delinquency rates on consumer loans and home mortgages have been low. Measured relative to disposable income, household net worth is at a fairly high level, although still below the peak reached earlier this decade.  Families with low to moderate incomes, however, face special financial challenges. These families generally have less of a cushion to absorb unanticipated expenses or to deal with adverse circumstances, such as the loss of employment or a serious health problem. Results from the Survey of Consumer Finances show that the median net worth for households in the lowest income quintile--those whose income placed them in the bottom fifth of the population--was only $7,500 in 2004, well below the median for all survey respondents of $93,000.2 The Survey data also indicate that households in the lowest quintile were significantly less likely than the average respondent to maintain a checking or savings account; almost 25 percent of those families were "unbanked," compared to less than 10 percent of families in the other income quintiles. The reasons given for not having an account varied: Some respondents said they would not write enough checks to make having an                                                       1  Kenneth Temkin and Noah Sawyer (2004), "Analysis of Alternative Financial Service Providers (781 KB PDF)," report prepared for the Fannie Mae Foundation by the Urban Institute Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center. 2  Brian K.

account worthwhile, but others were dissuaded by minimum balance requirements or said that they did not have enough money to justify opening an account. In some cases, a lack of knowledge about the services that banks offer or even a distrust of banks is likely a factor.  The Survey also found that lower-income households are less able than others to manage their debts. A greater fraction of these households had debt-to-income ratios of 40 percent or more or had a payment past due at least sixty days. The data also reveal that only 40 percent of families in the lowest quintile own a home, compared with a homeownership rate of 69 percent among all families surveyed. Finally, the data on retirement account ownership show an even larger gap, with only 10 percent of lowest-quintile families holding a retirement account, whereas 50 percent of all families responding to the survey reported participation in some type of retirement savings plan.  How can these disparities be addressed? Some general approaches to helping families of modest means build assets and improve their economic well-being include community economic development, financial education, and programs that encourage saving and investment. In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss each of these approaches briefly and offer some insights into their effectiveness based on research and experience. Community economic development In my time with the Federal Reserve, I have had a number of opportunities to meet with community economic development leaders--representatives of groups working to assist lower-income families become homeowners, start small businesses, better manage their finances, and save for the future. In fact, my first trip as a Federal Reserve Board member was to Brownsville, Texas, where I saw how a grassroots nonprofit organization is helping to build communities and to provide residents with the chance to build wealth through homeownership. The Community Development Corporation (CDC) of Brownsville works with multiple funding partners--governments at all levels, financial institutions, foundations, and corporations--to construct housing and to design innovative loan products that enable low-income families to qualify for mortgage credit. For example, because of the mix of funding sources, mortgage loans can be offered with features such as down-payment assistance or a below-market interest rate. The CDC of Brownsville also offers a program that allows prospective homeowners to acquire "sweat equity" in a property by working on construction teams to help build their own new home and those of other participating families.  As in the case of many community development organizations, the Brownsville CDC has also made financial education a critical element of its efforts to help lower-income residents improve their financial status. For example, participation in financial counseling or in an education program is typically required for a borrower to obtain a loan through the CDC or through one of its lending partners. However, the broader aim of these programs is to improve borrowers’ prospects for longer-term success in maintaining their credit and handling their overall finances. Since 1994, through this combination of leveraged financing arrangements and borrower education, the CDC of Brownsville has helped make homeownership possible for more than 2,500 low-income families. I cite the Brownsville example because of the opportunity that I had to learn about their work (and I recently had a similar opportunity to see some impressive community development efforts in the Anacostia neighborhood of the District of Columbia). But this localized approach to community development and wealth-building is playing out in neighborhoods throughout the country, in most cases through strategies tailored to the distinct needs of the particular community. Financial education and financial literacy Financial education has not only been integral to community development but has also begun to play a larger role in the broader consumer market. Clearly, to choose wisely from the wide variety of financial products and providers available, consumers must have at least basic financial knowledge. People who understand the financial aspects of purchasing a home or starting a business, or who appreciate the importance of saving for children’s education or retirement, will almost certainly be economically better off than those without that vital information. Financial literacy can be acquired through many channels: in school, on the job, through community programs and counseling, or through self-education and experience. Studies generally find that people receiving financial education or counseling have better financial outcomes. For example, research that analyzed data on nearly 40,000 mortgage loans targeted to 2 BIS Review 54/2006 
lower-income borrowers found that families that received individual financial counseling were less likely later to become delinquent on their mortgage payments.3 Similarly, another study found that borrowers who sought and received assistance from a credit counseling agency improved their credit management, in particular, by reducing the number of credit accounts on which they carried positive balances, cutting overall debt, and reducing delinquency rates.4 More broadly, the research shows that financial knowledge is correlated with good financial outcomes; for example, individuals familiar with basic financial concepts and products have been found to be more likely to balance their checkbook every month, budget for savings, and hold investment accounts.5Studies that establish an association between financial knowledge and good financial outcomes are encouraging, but they do not necessarily prove that financial training and counseling are the causes of the better outcomes. It could be, for example, that counseling is associated with better financial outcomes because the consumers who choose to seek counseling are the ones who are already better informed or more motivated to make good financial decisions. In medicine and other fields, researchers gain a better understanding of what causes what by doing controlled studies, in which some subjects are randomly assigned a particular treatment while others do not receive it. To translate this idea to the analysis of the effects of financial counseling, the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer and Community Affairs is collaborating with the Department of Defense to conduct a three-year study of the effects of financial education. This study will evaluate the impact of various educational programs on the financial decisions of soldiers and their families. It includes a treatment group of those receiving financial education, with the programs each family receives and when they receive it being determined randomly, and a control group of similar soldiers and their families who have not received this formal financial education. Because assignments of individuals to programs will be random, any observed changes in behavior can be more reliably attributed to the type and amount of counseling received. Among other things, the results of this study should help us better understand whether financial education leads to changes in behavior for participants in general or only for those at critical teaching moments, such as the period before making a major financial decision such as choosing a mortgage. I would like to say just a few words about the Federal Reserve’s broader role in promoting consumers’ understanding of financial products and services. Beyond conducting surveys of consumers and doing research, we work in a number of ways to support consumers in their financial decisionmaking. For example, through our consumer protection rule-writing authority, the Federal Reserve sets requirements that specify the information that must be disclosed to consumers about the terms and fees associated with credit and deposit accounts. These disclosures provide consumers with the essential information they need to assess the costs and benefits of financial services and compare products among different providers. We are currently reviewing many of our disclosures and plan to use focus groups and other methods to try to make these disclosures as clear and as user-friendly as possible.  The Federal Reserve System also works to promote financial education and financial literacy through various outreach and educational activities. We provide a great deal of substantive financial information, including interactive tools for economic education, on our education website http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/. The website links to a wide variety of financial education resources at the local, regional, and national levels. Additionally, the Federal Reserved Board collaborates with educational and community development organizations to support their efforts. Our national partners include the Jump$tart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy, the Conference of Mayors’ DollarWi$e Campaign, Operation HOPE, the American Savings Education Council, and America Saves, among others. At the regional level, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks work with organizations to support financial education and financial                                                       3  Abdighani Hirad and Peter M.

literacy. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland has worked with community financial educators to form regional networks that combine resources and share best practices. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago sponsors "MoneySmart Week," partnering with banks, businesses, government agencies, schools, community organizations, and libraries to host activities designed to help consumers learn how to manage money. The Federal Reserve Banks of San Francisco and Minneapolis have worked with leaders in the Native American community to develop financial education materials. My recent testimony to Congress on financial literacy provided information on many other projects and programs.6 The Federal Reserve will continue to make financial education a priority. Strategies to encourage saving Even if people know that they would be better off if they saved more or budgeted more wisely, we all know from personal experience that translating good intentions into action can be difficult. (Think about how hard it is to keep New Year’s resolutions.) The field of behavioral economics, which studies economic and financial decisions from a psychological perspective, has cast new light on consumer behavior and led to recommendations about how to improve people’s financial management. For example, studies of individual choices in 401(k) savings plans strongly suggest that workers do not pay adequate attention to their saving and investment decisions. Notably, despite the tax advantages of 401(k) contributions and, in some cases, a generous employer match, one-quarter of workers eligible for 401(k) plans do not participate. Studies have found, however, that if firms change the presentation of the plan from an "opt-in" choice to an "opt-out" choice, in which workers are automatically enrolled unless they actively choose to remain out of the plan, participation rates increase substantially.7 The impact of changing from "opt-in" to "opt-out" is particularly evident for younger and lower-income workers, who may have less financial expertise. In addition, participants in savings plans evidently do not understand the various investment options that are offered. A survey by the investment management firm, The Vanguard Group, found that many plan participants cannot assess the risk inherent in different types of financial assets; for example, many did not appreciate that a diversified equity mutual fund is generally less risky than keeping most of one’s wealth in the form of the employer’s stock.8 Indeed, employees appear to invest heavily in their company’s stock despite the fact that their income is already tied to the fortunes of their employer. More than one-quarter of 401(k) balances are held in company stock, and this high share arises not only from an employer match but from voluntary purchases as well.9These insights into consumer behavior have prompted some changes in the design of retirement plans and in education programs focused on saving for retirement. More employers now feature automatic enrollment in their 401(k) plans in an effort to boost participation. Also, some have set the default investment option to a diversified portfolio that is rebalanced automatically as the worker ages or have set contribution rates to rise automatically over time in line with salary increases. However, although these changes in program design may boost saving and improve investment choices, they are not a substitute for continued financial education. Employers, including the Federal Reserve Board, offer financial education at the workplace to help their workers gain a better understanding of retirement savings options. Helping people appreciate the importance of saving and giving them the tools they need to translate that knowledge into action remain major challenges.                                                       6  Chairman Ben S.

Conclusion Let me close by observing that many factors influence consumer financial behavior. Financial education is clearly central to helping consumers make better decisions for themselves and their families, but policymakers, regulators, nonprofit organizations, and financial service providers must all help ensure that consumers have the tools and the information they need to make better decisions. Success can only come through collaborative efforts. I see much interest today in increased collaboration toward these objectives, both in Washington and around the country. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. I encourage you to continue working together to help provide increased economic opportunity in your communities, and I wish you the best of luck in your efforts.  BIS Review 54/2006 5 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Activism and alertness in monetary policy Lecture by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, on “Activism and alertness in monetary policy,” at the conference on “Central Banks in the 21st Century” organised by the Bank of Spain, Madrid, 8 June 2006. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, Since 1 January 1999, the day on which it officially became the monetary authority of the euro area, the ECB has changed its policy rate, the rate on its main refinancing operations, 18 times. Over the same period, the Federal Reserve System has made 35 changes. The easing cycle that started on both sides of the Atlantic – and of the Channel – in 2001 saw a cumulative reduction in the policy rate of 275 basis points in the euro area, accomplished in a sequence of seven moves. The ECB started to reverse that cycle in December last year and has since changed its policy in a sequence of three steps. In the United States, the same easing phase saw 13 reductions, with a total loosening of 550 basis points, and was first reversed in June 2004. Since then, the Federal Reserve has hiked its target rate 16 times in continuous steps. I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this impressive programme to revisit a theme on which I have reflected in the past: “activism” in monetary policy. Is there a univocal definition of this notion? Can “activism” be quantified by simple statistics such as the frequency and size of policy moves? Can a central bank be “active” while moving its policy rate in a measured and observationally cautious way? Was the ECB active enough in responding to the evolving state of the euro area economy? The few facts that I have recounted seem to suggest otherwise. I will try to convince you that the contrary is true.  I will offer some provisional answers on the basis of what I believe I have learned thus far. I suspect, though, that the passing of time and further analysis of the euro area economy will be needed to deepen our understanding of this issue.  My definition of activism in monetary policy is, I believe, conventional: activism is the strategic attitude of a central bank that is constantly endeavouring to be faithful to its objective. In the case of the ECB, it is the constant striving to keep inflation close to its arithmetic objective, and to take all the steps needed to check nascent inflationary pressures while at the same time trying to minimise unnecessary macroeconomic disruptions in the process. “Activist” is an attribute that applies to a strategy, not to a policy path.  My answer to the question of whether or not activism can be measured by simple statistics is negative. Strategic activism in monetary policy cannot be quantified in simple terms, not in abstraction from knowledge of the key structural forces and economic relationships that govern the functioning of our systems at any point in time. When evaluating the appropriateness of their action, central banks do not have the luxury of linking policy to a handful of summary statistics. They engage in a complicated process of signal extraction from a wealth of diffuse data and events. They calibrate decisions to the key structural parameters of the economy in which monetary policy has to function, to the nature of the shocks to which the economy is typically prone. The path of policy is adjusted accordingly.  The ECB’s strategy is as active as it needs to be to fulfil our mandate. I would claim that clarity about the objective of our policy afforded considerable latitude for action in the early years of the decade, and a remarkable leverage over market conditions more recently. This has happened despite repeated unfavourable shocks in the former period and apparent policy inaction in the latter. Always, our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, much more than our words, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term, a sign that the complex analysis required to predict our judgement has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data. BIS Review 53/2006 1 
 Policy activism and economic dynamism To frame the issue, let us consider a stereotypical monetary policy reaction function that has a short-term interest rate on the left and a number of observable reaction variables on the right. Think, for example, of any kind of reaction functions that econometricians and expert observers often use – and sometimes abuse – to compare monetary policy strategies. In essence, they all encapsulate a simple rule of thumb: raise the policy rate if anticipated inflation is higher than the objective and there are signs that the economy is operating above capacity. An additional condition for ensuring macroeconomic stability that applies to these rules is that the reaction in the nominal rate must be strong enough for the real rate to be varied pro-cyclically: when inflation expectations rise, and the economy expands above potential, real monetary conditions have to be tightened.  I choose this way of framing the issue primarily because it is widely used by our observers, and because it is sufficiently concise to be easily understood. But, before launching into the analysis, I should add that, precisely because it is simple and pedagogical, this framework is also a very incomplete description of our policy behaviour. Overall, because it does not capture the very essence of the two-pillar strategy, based on an economic assessment of medium-term risks to price stability, on the one hand, and a cross-checking based on medium to longer-term risks assessed though our monetary analysis, on the other. Also, because such representations of our policy are not sufficiently state-contingent, whereas my colleagues and I are far from being exclusively guided by mechanical configurations of indicators, but are very interested in the contingencies, and finally take our decisions on the basis of synthetic judgement enlightened by multiple experiences. As I often say, collegial wisdom is of the essence in central banking. This underscores the tension between describing policy simply and implementing policy simply: simple descriptions of policy need not – and indeed never do – mean simple policy behaviour.  Assuming that the parameters attached to the various indicator variables in the reaction function indeed capture the deep strategic preferences of the central bank, empirical estimates of these coefficients are often used to quantify the strength with which the central bank intends to respond to the state of the economy. In other words, these estimated parameters are sometimes viewed as objective measures of strategic “activism” in monetary policy.  A central bank would qualify as strategically more passive – or less active – than another central bank if the estimated coefficient attached to inflation expectations in deviation from the central bank’s objective, and the estimated coefficient penalising the indicator of macroeconomic slack, turned out to be smaller. Why would this central bank qualify as more “passive”? Because, for given variances of inflation and real activity, this central bank would indeed be inclined to take more moderate action in response to changes in the outlook. It would move its policy rate by narrower margins – and perhaps 2 BIS Review 53/2006 
more infrequently – than its more “activist” counterpart. Moreover, as analysts typically append a partial adjustment mechanism to the representation of how the central bank interest rate responds to the economic state, there is an additional source of “activism” – or “passivity” – that would emerge from these simple empirics. This is the inertia coefficient attached to the lagged interest rate dependent variable, which in these rules moderates the pace of reaction of the policy rate to its fundamental determinants.  In any case, in the naive theory of this world, plain comparison of the frequencies of policy moves and the size of interest rate adjustments would suffice to tell the strategies of these two central banks apart. A smoother policy path would signal a “more passive” strategy. But of course the world is not that simple, and in fact there are serious pitfalls lurking behind strategic inferences drawn on the basis of comparisons of variances in policy rates. It is not too difficult to portray situations in which such inferences could be highly misleading. I will give three examples, all relaxing one important qualification upon which my earlier example was predicated: the assumption that our two central banks are confronted with the same economic environment.  First, imagine two central banks which are equally responsive to economic conditions: in the reaction-rule jargon that I am using here, these are two central banks that share exactly the same reaction parameters. But one central bank now faces a less dynamic economy than its counterpart. By “less dynamic” I mean an economy that – as a matter of regularity – is hit by shocks of smaller magnitude which tend to fade away more gradually. Here, reaction parameters are the same – by hypothesis – but the reaction variables fluctuate at different speeds. All other things being equal, the patterns of adjustment of the policy rate that the same rule would induce in the two economies would be likely to look very different. The central bank operating in the less dynamic economy would in all likelihood be observed to adjust interest rates along a more moderate path. The other central bank would appear more reactive. But any strategic implications drawn from the variance in the two policy paths would be purely illusionary. The smoother course of policy would not reveal any deep-seated strategic inertia: it would only reflect the same response to shocks with quite different dynamic properties. Monetary policy would appear “passive” because the economy itself was evolving slowly.1A second example again considers two identical central banks, now facing shocks of a different nature. One central bank predominantly faces demand shocks, which result in persistent departures from trend growth. This statistical pattern has symmetric and durable effects on output and inflation and thus presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem under the rule that I am postulating here for simplicity. As both reaction variables – forecasted inflation and output – would frequently move in tandem, the policy rate of this central bank would have to be changed frequently and forcefully in the same direction to offset the shock. But what would happen in the other economy, if it – unlike the first – were more prone to supply shocks? Experience suggests that supply shocks yield sharp transitory increases in inflation, possibly followed by smaller, more permanent “second-round” effects, though the longer-run impact on inflation is obviously significantly determined by the response of monetary policy. Given the transitory nature of the initial inflation bursts, the simple hypothetical rule – which incorporates the reaction to expected inflation – would advise the central bank to “look through” the immediate disturbance and change policy only to the extent needed to offset the anticipated more permanent effects of the shock on inflation in subsequent quarters. Its policy rate, again, would be observed to be less variable. What is important to note is that the same rule – equally active strategies – would support two different patterns of observed policy behaviour in different economic environments. The third case is perhaps the most interesting of all. Here exogenous shocks are identical, but economic structures differ. Different transmission mechanisms therefore propagate the same shocks with lags that vary between the two economies. The first economy has more rigid adjustment mechanisms: price-setters and wage-negotiators are more sluggish than those in the other economy in processing economic news – including changes in the stance of monetary policy – and bringing them to bear on their decisions. What is the source of those rigidities in the first economy? There can be many reasons for rigidity. Perhaps labour practices and contractual institutions – dating from the early post-war decades when the economy was heavily regulated – induce distortions in large                                                       1  A similar interpretation of “interest rate inertia” – the tendency of central banks to adjust rates in the same direction and in small steps – can be found in G. Rudebusch, “Term structure evidence on interest rate smoothing and monetary policy inertia”, Journal of Monetary Economics, Vol. 49 (pp. 1161-1187), 2002. BIS Review 53/2006 3 
segments of the labour market. This stands in the way of an efficient matching of skills and productive capabilities. Perhaps tight regulatory restraint on business and statutory inhibitions discourage innovation and impede a faster response to new shocks and new opportunities. Whatever the source of rigidity, the observational result is that prices and wages in the first economy reflect changes in fundamentals with considerable lags.  How should monetary policy respond to shocks in these conditions? Note that I am moving away from the naive world of simple policy rules and am taking a step further into the – admittedly no less conjectural – realm of optimal policy design. The answer to my question depends critically on the inflation process that we postulate. We know that when inflation expectations are well-anchored around the inflation objective of the central bank, the evolution of inflation over time is influenced by the numerical objective of policy more than by the history of inflation itself. We can state this differently, saying that when the economy internalises the central bank’s objective firmly, the inflation process becomes less persistent and more forward-looking. If inflation expectations are well-anchored, a shock to inflation in the recent past is likely to have a lesser impact on inflation in the future. One reason for this is that the shock will not encourage workers to bargain for commensurate rises in nominal wages to protect the real value of earnings. Equally, firms would certainly resist such potential bargaining. All such parties and other price-setters will anticipate that the central bank will ultimately drive inflation back to its pre-shock level. Hence, they will tend to treat past inflationary shocks as transitory and inconsequential for the future outlook. In the first economy in this example, where prices are sticky and inflation expectations are well-anchored, monetary policy can be more patient and focused on the medium term when confronting a cost-push shock. Again, as in the other two examples, it is likely to be observed to change policy less aggressively in the face of an unexpected shock to headline inflation. But this seeming “patience”, once again, does not signal inertia, “passivity” or neglect for macroeconomic conditions. It reflects a careful calibration of the policy course to the structural peculiarities of the underlying economy. First and foremost, the policy response to the inflationary shock will be less persistent because the inflationary consequences of the shock will be more promptly reabsorbed in the first place. Second, with stickier prices, a change in the nominal policy rate of a given size will have a stronger impact on the real rate, which is all that matters when it comes to measuring the stance of policy. In these conditions, a more moderate policy path is not a cause of instability. In fact, it is the very precondition for avoiding the dangers of over-steering, of accidentally destabilising the economy.  Of course, the thought experiments that I have been sharing with you so far are only as useful as the rules or the optimality benchmarks with which real-world behaviour has been compared. And I am certainly not the only one here who believes that simple reaction rules – or monetary policy optimality exercises, for that matter – cannot serve as the ultimate test for actual policy behaviour. But I hope I have conveyed one notion. Even in the over-simplified world of my canonical examples, where the macroeconomic state can be adequately described by a handful of facts, where these facts are reliably condensed in summary indicators – which, too, are immune from sampling errors and statistical revisions2 – and where policy algorithms are an acceptable description of policy choices, even in that conjectural world the variability of the policy instrument would not be a sufficient statistic with which to judge monetary policy strategies. In particular, even in that world, a slower-moving, structurally more rigid economy would support an observationally more moderate policy course. In the real world, as I will try to explain next, that observationally moderate path for policy receives an even stronger justification.  Facts and policy in the euro area My emphasis on a structurally more rigid and less dynamic economy periodically facing adverse supply shocks is, of course, deliberate. That laboratory case resembles the euro area that I know. I will organise my interpretation of stylised facts about the euro area in the recent past into three broad categories: shocks, structures and monetary policy.                                                        2  Of course, in the actual practice of monetary policy, uncertainty about the data is extremely pervasive. We are even uncertain about the current economic situation as economic data are received with a lag, are typically subject to multiple revisions, and in any case can only roughly and partially depict the underlying economic reality.  4 BIS Review 53/2006 
Shocks One reason the euro area resembles my third example is that, compared with the United States, it seems to be subject to demand shocks of smaller magnitude but to be more frequently hit by supply shocks.3 In the last ten years this shock pattern seems to have grown even more pronounced, despite globalisation and a generalised shift towards closer international economic integration.4 This is nowhere more evident than in the anatomy of the boom-bust cycle that spanned the decade starting in 1995 in the two economies. In the United States, the run-up phase was significantly propelled – as we know with hindsight – by overly optimistic views about long-run earnings growth and, notably, exaggerated beliefs in the profitability of emerging technologies. But the strength in business investment that the boom brought with it also had important implications for the supply side of the US economy, through its influence on the rate of increase in labour productivity and thus the economy’s sustainable level of potential output. ECB staff calculations estimate that the contribution to the growth of output per hour worked coming from capital deepening doubled in the United States in the course of the 1990s. Subsequently – and despite the sharp reappraisal of those expectations and the unprecedented drop in business investment that followed the market collapse in 2000 – it stabilised at the elevated levels that it had reached at the turn of the millennium. Since then, remarkably, capital deepening has been replaced, as the main engine of output per hour growth, by extraordinary advancements in total factor productivity (TFP). Arguably, US firms have been able to meet expanding demand with a more efficient organisation of the production processes.  The same ten-year episode had a distinctly different face in the euro area. The stock market appreciation – comparable in size to that seen in the United States – went hand in hand with a decline, not a rise, in the contribution of capital to measured productivity. And a contemporaneous steady decline in TFP throughout the decade has reinforced, rather than offset, the diminishing contribution of capital.5 The euro area seems to have had its fair share of stock market turbulence, without enjoying the side benefit of improved supply conditions. The slowdown in trend productivity has been a primary determinant of the weak economic performance of the euro area. By depressing income growth prospects and by reducing the prospective return on capital, it has held back consumption spending and business investment, which has been further curtailed to some extent by the ongoing demographic shift towards a more elderly population.6 Rapidly decelerating productivity was one force behind the counter-cyclical rebound in unit labour costs that we observed during the early part of the new millennium. [See Figure 2].  This surge in unit labour costs was atypical, if contrasted with the way in which unit labour costs in the United States elastically responded to the downturn with a sharp decline, and it represented an ongoing source of inflationary pressures. Adverse underlying developments in productivity have made it more difficult for our firms to smooth through the volatility of the many non-wage cost disturbances that they have encountered since 1999. This lesser degree of resilience has kept the evolution of inflation – and real activity as well – constantly vulnerable to unexpected shocks, such as the increases in the prices of energy and beef – to name only two – which have been brought about by                                                       3  See, for example, the structural comparative analysis in F. Smets and R. Wouters, “Comparing shocks and frictions in US and euro area business cycles: a Bayesian DSGE approach”, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 20(1), January 2005. 4  This is a well-known, if certainly surprising, fact. See, for example, J. Stock and M. Watson, “Has the business cycle changed? Evidence and explanations”, paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Symposium “Monetary Policy and Uncertainty,” Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 28-30 2003. 5  See G. Gomez-Salvador, A. Musso, M. Stocker and J. Turunen, “Labour productivity developments in the euro area”, forthcoming as an ECB Occasional Paper. They report that the average contribution of capital to measured productivity growth in the United States was 0.6 percentage point in the first half of the 1990s, increasing to 1.1 percentage points in the second half of the decade and stabilising at 1.0 percentage point on average between 2000 and 2004. In the euro area, the trend was reversed: a contribution of 1 percentage point in the first half of the 1990s became 0.4 percentage point and 0.6 percentage point, respectively, in the second half of the 1990s and in the first five years of this century. The TFP contribution, calculated on the basis of the Solow residual, tripled in the United States from the early 1990s to 1.6 percent on average in 2000-2004, but halved in the euro area from 1.3 to 0.6 percent in the same period. Correcting the euro area TFP measures mentioned above for variable capital utilisation does not change the picture. In fact, such correction would shift the start of the slowdown in productivity to the mid-1990s. 6  As the share of the population that is of working age declines, the rise in the capital stock needed to equip the labour force decreases. Lower rates of investment in some member countries may also reflect some relocation of production to China and other newly industrialised countries (where investment rates have been quite high in recent years).

adverse changes in supply conditions.7 Note that inflation [Figure 3] edged higher in the downturn phase and remained at elevated levels thereafter, at a time when the accumulating margin of slack in labour and product markets could in fact have been expected to reduce price pressures. Again, compare these developments with the sharp disinflation which occurred, during the same period, in the United States.  Of course, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labour or other production factors. Consequently, we can never be certain about the level of activity that would represent the full utilisation of available resources, and even less so about the strength of the relationship that links utilisation and inflation. However, I hope that I have demonstrated that this connection is seemingly weak in the euro area, probably weaker than across the Atlantic.                                                          7  The cluster of large unanticipated supply shocks that have implications for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices that is the focus of the ECB’s inflation analysis includes a strong and persistent increase in the price of oil and natural gas in 2000 and again after 2004; increases in unprocessed food prices associated with the outbreak of BSE and foot-and-mouth disease in 2001; and rises in administered prices and tobacco taxes announced in late 2004. 6 BIS Review 53/2006 
 Structures This structural feature brings me to the second category of my remarks: the structure of the economy on this side of the Atlantic. I will concentrate on two factors that critically affect the relationship between inflation and the fundamental shocks that drive the economy and determine its state: price flexibility and the anchoring of price-setting.  Extensive empirical research on price flexibility and inflation persistence in the euro area has recently been produced in a concerted effort that has occupied staff of the ECB and of the entire European System of Central Banks.8 It comes to two main conclusions. First, in the euro area, prices are distinctly less flexible than, say, in the United States. Prices change infrequently: the average duration of a consumer price spell – a measure of the time that it takes for retailers to reprice their products – is 13 months [Table 1]. According to surveys, it is 11 months for producers. In the United States, comparable figures indicate durations of less than 7 months and slightly more than 8 months respectively.9                                                          8  See E. Dhyne, L. Alvarez, H. Le Bihan, G. Veronese, D. Dias, J. Hoffmann, N. Jonker, P. Lünnemann, F. Rumler and J. Vilmunen, “Price-setting in the euro area: some stylised facts from individual consumer price data”, ECB Working Paper No 524, 2005. The paper reports that the average duration of CPI price spells in the euro area is 4.3 quarters. By comparison, M. Bils and P. Klenow, in “Some evidence on the importance of sticky prices”, Journal of Political Economy 112, 2005, calculate that the average duration of CPI prices in the United States is 2.2 quarters. Other Phillips curve-based analyses broadly confirm these results. For the euro area, see J. Gali, M. Gertler and D. Lopez-Salido, “European inflation dynamics”, European Economic Review 45(7), 2001, and J. Gali, M. Gertler and D. Lopez-Salido, “Erratum”, European Economic Review 47(4), 2003. 9  Abstracting from methodological differences in price-collecting procedures across statistical institutes, differences in the frequency of price adjustments can be due to various causes. Differences in the degree of competition, especially in the services sector, may be a factor, particularly given evidence that the divergence of such frequencies is most pronounced in that sector. Another factor that is often cited is the fact that small corner shops, which change their prices less frequently than supermarkets, have a higher market share in euro area countries than in the United States.

Table 1: Measures of price stickiness for the euro area and the United States   Sources: For the CPI in the euro area, Dhyne et al. (2005), Bils and Klenow (2004) in the US. For the PPI, Vermeulen et al. (2005). Surveys: Fabiani et al. (2005) for the euro area, Blinder et al. (1998) for the US. New Keynesian Phillips Curve: Estimates in Galí et al. (2001, 2003) refer to the GDP deflator and are converted from original quarterly figures.  More infrequent price revisions make the setting of prices less responsive to economic news, including, as I already pointed out, changes in monetary conditions. In general, sticky price revision processes reduce the odds that the imbalances created by economic shocks can be rectified by adjustments in prices. Conversely, they make the burden of adjustment to a shock fall disproportionately on changes in output, incomes and employment. Also, stickier prices tend – all other things being equal – to increase the persistence of inflation. This is because the impact of a shock that today modifies firms’ real cost conditions tends to be spread out over an extended future, as staggered price adjustments catch up only slowly with the changed underlying circumstances.  Despite sluggish price-setting mechanisms, however, inflation persistence in the euro area is low by international standards. This is the second important finding of the new body of evidence that I mentioned: an inflationary shock dissipates quickly in the euro area despite rigidities, and inflation has a tendency to return to its long-run norm reasonably quickly. The half-life of the effect of a shock to inflation is considerably less than one year, which is close to the figure that one obtains, for example, for the United States, again notwithstanding vastly different patterns of price-updating practices across the two areas.  What explains this apparently inconsistent evidence? Another ECB study, estimating a structural model on euro area and US data, goes some way towards reconciling empirical stickiness in prices and low persistence in inflation on the basis of a model of inflation determination that features real costs and expectations.10 As I said before, even if price sluggishness introduces persistence into the inflation process – which in itself tends to perpetuate past inflation pressures into the future – some of that persistence can be undone if the expectations of price and wage-setters are focused on the objective of the central bank. Indeed, this study finds that the influence of the ECB’s inflation objective on the evolution over time of inflation outweighs the influence of past shocks, and thus at least partly compensates for the added inertia resulting from a more rigid economic structure. We are pleased to observe that analysis of survey-based measures of inflation expectations suggests that central bank leverage on expectations has become much stronger since the establishment of the euro.11                                                      10  See L. Christiano, R. Motto and M. Rostagno, “Financial factors in business cycles”, presented at the IMF-IRF Conference on DSGE Modelling at Policymaking Institutions: Progress and Prospects hosted by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Washington, 2-3 December 2005). 11  The consumer survey on inflation expectations compiled by the European Commission is a good barometer of the sensitivity of short-term inflation expectations to recent inflation dynamics. Results are presented in terms of the difference between the percentage of respondents who believe prices will increase and the percentage of respondents who believe that they will decrease or stabilise. Prior to the euro cash changeover there was a tight relationship between this qualitative indicator and actual inflation developments, with a correlation coefficient close to 1. However, since the cash changeover, the correlation between the two series has dropped to 0.4.  8 BIS Review 53/2006 
Monetary policy Having reviewed structures and shocks, I now move on to the third aspect of my discussion of the euro area: monetary policy. Did considerations pertaining to the nature of the shocks that occurred in the recent past and to the structural peculiarities of the euro area play any role in positioning the stance of monetary policy? Can they go some way towards explaining the observationally moderate path that the policy rate has followed in the euro area? Did the smoother path of our policy rate impede a smooth adjustment of the euro area to the shocks that have hit the global economy in the recent past? Finally, does low inflation persistence provide reason for complacency?  When the ECB in early 2001 initiated the easing cycle that we started to reverse in December last year, this was done on the heels of significant adverse supply shocks, relatively strong wage dynamics, and headline inflation rates at levels unseen in Europe since the late phases of convergence to the new currency. Yet the Governing Council judged that our commitment to attaining price stability, in line with our official definition, through our monetary policy strategy was sufficiently credible for us to take that easing decision without running the risk of destabilising inflation expectations. That conviction was reinforced by a rapidly deteriorating outlook and by reassuring signs that inflation expectations discounted a scenario in which inflation would settle in the zone of price stability in the medium term. The rapid softening of activity that we saw coming and the increasing odds that the recovery would not materialise soon – we believed – would validate ex post the inflation expectations and make the threat of renewed inflation considerably weaker. Information extracted from monetary trends supported our prediction of subdued inflation looking into the more distant future.  Monetary accommodation was quicker and, in retrospect, far more persistent than could have been predicted on the basis of the policy regularities on record. In the end, monetary action amounted to an interest rate reduction of 275 basis points, bringing the policy rate to a level which was below the lowest intervention rate of the central banks of an overwhelming majority of member countries, including Germany, during the last 50 years. It is all the more remarkable that we were able to follow such a historically unseen trajectory for our vast continental economy, the euro area, given that the individual countries had very diverse and mixed legacies as regards past monetary credibility. It is difficult to work out a convincing counterfactual: what would have happened if the reaction of the ECB had been more in line with the patterns of policy behaviour established in the past, rather than the more forceful action we took. However, structural – if model-specific – analysis of the mix of the macroeconomic shocks that have hit the euro area since 2001 reveals with hindsight that the extra monetary policy stimulus that we introduced has been critical in avoiding a deeper and more enduring recession here and on a global scale.  I judge that the policy course was carefully calibrated to the structural characteristics of the euro area transmission mechanism, some features of which I tried to outline earlier. We were guided, in particular, by the understanding that a central bank operating in a relatively rigid economy is able to deliver the same quantum of monetary accommodation by adjusting its policy instrument in more moderate steps than in a relatively more flexible economy. Under the structural conditions that prevail in our economy, a more aggressive easing would have introduced unwelcome volatility in both inflation and output that would have necessitated corrective, countervailing action further down the road.12 Certainly, as I will argue shortly, the ECB would not have maintained the nominal and real policy rate at the low levels at which they were held for more than two years without consistent signs that expectations were well-anchored and inflationary shocks were being quickly reabsorbed. Alertness and active communication No central bank represented in this room, or elsewhere, can reasonably spell out in advance its reaction to every conceivable contingency. This means that surprises in our behaviour can never be                                                       12  Counterfactual simulations based on a large-scale estimated dynamic general equilibrium model of the euro area have quantified the implications of alternative policy scenarios. This analysis reaches two conclusions. First, the loss in GDP that would have been associated with a situation in which the ECB did not deviate from the estimated reaction rule embedded in the model – and thus monetary policy in the euro area followed a tighter course – would have come close to 1% per annum on average since 2001. Second, had the ECB followed a more aggressive policy easing, one resembling the sharp rate reduction engineered by the Federal Reserve in the United States, the standard deviation of inflation would have tripled and the standard deviation of output doubled since 2001. The model used is documented in Christiano et al cited above.  BIS Review 53/2006 9 
ruled out, notably in the face of potent shocks. In particular, we might be confronted with new occurrences of risks which could force us to take bold steps that our observers could not have predicted by extrapolating from our past history of policy conduct. To some extent, this is what occurred over the earlier phase of the international economic downturn: we took sizeable risks in the direction of “activism”.  What were those risks? First, in an economy as rigid as the euro area, it might well be true that temporary imbalances between demand and potential supply are slow to show through convincingly to inflation. But if and when they finally do, they would be more costly to correct.13 So, monetary policy should be sufficiently alert to any threats to the outlook for price stability, so that it does not find itself reacting belatedly – and with less chance of success – to trends that have long been underway.  Second, it is true that the expectation that inflation will not come loose from its anchor affords some short-term flexibility to respond to economic disturbances – with a view to ensuring more balanced macroeconomic conditions in the longer term. But that flexibility only lasts as long as economic agents and the public are confident that the opportunity will not be misused. And we just do not know enough about the way policy actions influence expectations and how sensitive central banks’ credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation to warrant experimenting. Occasional monetary policy activism, as circumstances require, is not the same as fine-tuning. Fine-tuning – if I may twist a phrase borrowed from Alan Blinder and Ricardo Reis – cannot be resurrected.14 Building and maintaining a reputation for prudent policy involves commitment to a systematic strategy: that is, following a recurrent pattern of behaviour, so that stable expectations are consistently validated ex post.  During the extended period of policy accommodation, we were able to steer expectations effectively without explicit action, proof that markets accept as true the ultimate motives of policy that we profess. In those instances in which expectations displayed signs of overreaction to current events – such as surging oil prices – our renewed emphasis in communication on our objective, on the vigilance and determination that we would apply to enforce it, on our steady alertness, provided effective resistance to inordinate developments. Importantly, signalling vigilance proved instrumental in reaching a common understanding with the markets: the ECB, though observationally inactive, was at any time ready to start action. Our policy course was rightly seen as always contingent on the arrival of new information. Given the information available each time the Governing Council meets, the standing assumption in the markets should always be that the policy decision is aimed at positioning the stance of policy appropriately. No history of past monetary policy decisions could ever be taken as an indication of a commitment, on our side, to enact a sequence of interest rate moves in the future. Unconditional – or “quasi-unconditional” – talk about future policy would have impaired the difficult balance that we maintained between supportive credit conditions and persistently anchored inflation expectations. Active emphasis in communication upon “alertness” required keeping all options open to a – possibly quick – change in policy. Pre-commitment to a policy path would certainly have made that reversal of policy difficult to execute and/or to justify, and therefore non-credible.  The markets seem to have internalised these strategic principles with an increasing degree of precision. Incoming data which, since the autumn of 2005, have indicated more persuasive signs of a recovery in an environment of abundant liquidity and elevated commodity prices were correctly mapped into expectations that the stance then prevailing would not be consistent with controlling inflation over the medium term. Markets anticipated in good time that the ECB would soon begin reversing the extra easing that had been put in place.  In retrospect, market expectations have aligned well with our intentions. Since December, consistent with our remit to be alert and pre-emptive, the monetary policy of the ECB has been perceived to be in a mode of progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation. Indeed, this withdrawal has been and remains conditional on the evolution of our analysis with respect to our objective of price stability, but it has not been predicated on any single short-term indicator of the macroeconomic state. In the last few months, the ECB has not measured the state of the economy by the strength or weakness of any particular piece of incoming news. It has continued to extract the macroeconomic trend from the                                                       13  Another way to state this notion is that in an economy such as the euro area, where prices and wages are as rigid as they prove to be, the “sacrifice ratio” is probably large. This means that the action required to counter inflation – when inflationary pressures actually emerge – would be more forceful. 14  See A. Blinder and R. Reis, “Understanding the Greenspan Standard”, paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Symposium “The Greenspan Era: Lessons for the Future”, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, August 25-27 2005. 10 BIS Review 53/2006 
wealth of cumulative evidence accruing – from month to month – from the economic and the monetary side. In both cases, the medium-term orientation of its monitoring activity has been preserved. Two examples: as regards our economic analysis, when looking at the underlying trend of growth of the European economy, we judged in the second half of last year that we were experiencing a recovery with the trend progressively approaching potential. We judged that the short-term volatility observed in important indicators, including the quarterly growth figure for the fourth quarter of 2005, did not call into question the medium-term growth prospects and therefore the associated gradual increase of risks to price stability. Another example can be extracted from our monetary analysis: consistent indications that broad money growth was increasingly due to its most liquid components has contributed in recent months to a gradual tilt of the balance of risks perceived to be signalled by our monetary analysis. It was not the behaviour of aggregate M3 per se which altered the outlook for price stability. It was the realisation that the structural force at work behind persistently abundant liquidity was becoming increasingly connected with final spending and pricing decisions.  As I said at the start, the complexity of the analysis required to predict our moves has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data. The understanding of our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term. I attribute this satisfactory result to our policy framework, which features a primary, sharply-defined objective and a systematic reaction to events whenever the objective is perceived to be at risk.  Concluding remarks I am sometimes asked the following question: “You are in the process of increasing rates. Is your judgement that your rates today are significantly lower than they should be? What then is the level of the “neutral rate” that you would judge it appropriate to reach (as rapidly as possible)?” My response to such questions would be the following. First, we are not in a position that we would judge “abnormal”, in the sense that we would have to increase as rapidly as possible our interest rates up to the “normal” level. We are in a process of progressively withdrawing the present degree of monetary accommodation commensurate with the risks to price stability that we perceive, associated in particular with the present development of the economic recovery. To the extent that we never previously pre-committed to unconditional moves and we have always adhered to the posture of steady alertness which is at the heart of our strategy, our monetary policy stance should and does – to the best of our own comprehensive, deep and candid assessment of the situation – at any time makes it possible to cope with the risks we see for price stability in a medium-term perspective. Then, in a dynamic perspective, our refusal of unconditional pre-commitments, our position of permanent, steady alertness and our strategy help focus our policy upon being permanently at the “correct level” in terms of attaining our primary goal in a medium-term perspective.  Second, from a central bank’s perspective, the Wicksellian concept of a “neutral rate” is more particularly useful in the event that the central bank has – for whatever reason – moved its rates far away from the policy stance that it would judge appropriate ici et maintenant, here and now. As you can see, in my view, this cannot be the case for the Governing Council of the ECB. Third, one can be sure that we will continue to analyse the situation very carefully on an ongoing basis. It is clear that if our main scenario is confirmed over time, a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be appropriate. We do not specify ex ante a sequence of policy actions, as I have said clearly since last December. The appropriate policy stance will always depend on information on the economic and monetary side and on the source and dynamic properties of the underlying shocks that will hit the economy and we will always remain alert. It is the combination of events and data, some expected, others unexpected, that will be analysed and will permit us to define our future trajectory.  Thank you for your attention.

Durmuş Yilmaz: Central banking in emerging economies – the Turkish experience  Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at the “International Conference on Economics”, Ankara, 12 September 2006. *      *      * Dear professors, colleagues, and guests, I am very pleased to participate in such a conference covering a broad range of economic issues and attended by many distinguished academicians from different countries. It is also a great pleasure to deliver a speech on the topic of central banking in emerging economies and the Turkish experience. Dear guests, Given the wide range of issues related to central banking in emerging economies and the limited time available, I have decided to limit the extent of my remarks today. I’d like to talk about the challenges we face as today’s central bankers in emerging market countries, mainly in the context of the Turkish experience. However, before embarking on this subject, let me first of all step back and take a look at the evolution of central banking, especially in the recent past. There is no doubt about that throughout the 20th century, central banking has undergone a tremendous transformation both in numerical terms and institutional aspects. At the beginning of the last century, for example, there were just 15 central banks in the world. In fact, what is more important than the figures is that central banks were first established mainly as the lender of last resort and banknote issuer, rather than as an institutional body of monetary policy. Today, there are 160 central banks operating around the world. Some of them are also responsible for supervision and regulation of financial system and have been publishing financial stability reports, and some of them are targeting a certain measure of general price level and have been issuing inflation reports. Thus, in a broader perspective, the evolution of central banking has followed a course from maintaining liquidity when it is necessary and issuing banknotes, towards keeping inflation low and stable, and preserving stability in financial markets. In some sense, this evolution process can be characterized as the converging of the objective functions of central banks all around the world. To be more precise, it is generally accepted that in the case of both industrialized nations and emerging economies, the main contribution that a central bank can make to economic welfare in the long run is achieving and maintaining price stability. Moreover, maintaining price stability is not merely an issue of maximization of economic welfare. It gives people the confidence that money will retain its value over time, ensures that price signals function as a guide for markets to function efficiently and establishes trust in the interaction among economic agents, in property rights, in society and in the future in general1. Under this framework, central banks today operate mainly with the overriding objective of price stability either explicitly or implicitly. Dear guests, The establishment of the single mandate as price stability has also had significant implications in the institutional design of central banks. In fact, as is clearly seen especially in emerging market countries, price stability can only be achieved through long term and determined policy implementations. It is at this point that independence, as an assurance given to the public to ensure long-term price stability, comes to the forefront as the crucial feature of institutional design of central banks. In my view, of all the changes in the face of central banking in the last two decades, the most important one is the increasing emphasis that has been placed on central bank independence.                                                       1  Issing, O. (2000). “Should We Have Faith in Central Banks?”. BIS Review 88/2006 1 
While inflation was falling and independence was becoming an important feature of central banking around the world, Turkey was unable to experience the same process. It was not until 2001 that the Central Bank of Turkey gained independence close to global standards. In 2001, with the amendments made in its Law, achieving and maintaining price stability was stated as the primary objective, and the Central Bank of Turkey was provided with the direct authority to set monetary policy and choose instruments at its own discretion to achieve price stability. I believe this is one of the major structural reforms in the Turkish economy, especially in terms of its effects on inflation. Of course, independence is not a concept that can be achieved via the implementation of law alone. It is a concept that policy practices have a great influence upon. Dear participants, Having mentioned the two milestones in the notion of central banking, I’d now like to continue with the challenges of central banking in emerging economies combined with the Turkish experience in terms of monetary policy implementations. Although objective functions are similar in financially liberalized and well-functioning market economies, the transmission of monetary policy actions on economies certainly differs between industrialized countries and emerging market economies. Accordingly, there is a wide range of views among economists on how monetary policy decisions influence economies. If we add the uncertainties faced by the internal dynamics of emerging market economies to the picture, the impact of decisions taken by central banks might differ from one country to another both in terms of the nature and the time and even from one period of time to another for the same country. First, it is important to note that in the design and implementation of monetary policy, the understanding of structural changes is essential since the impacts of monetary policy decisions in a given economy depend on its structural changes and macroeconomic environment2. On the other hand, it is clear that emerging economies like Turkey are subject to structural changes more frequently than any other developed economy. Combining these two facts, central bankers in emerging economies face the challenge of modeling the economy properly and react accordingly. In addition, I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that subsequent crises and reform processes have largely defined the economic landscape of emerging market economies in the last twenty years. Thus, uncertainty, which naturally exists in every economy, constitutes a real challenge for central bankers in many emerging economies because of their volatile and unpredictable structure. Dear guests, What we have been experiencing in the Turkish economy in the last five years can be classified as one of the clear examples of the impact of structural changes on an economy. First of all, after a thirty-year period of high and chronic inflation, inflation declined from 68.5 percent in 2001 to 10.26 percent in August 2006. This decline in inflation also made it possible to perform the currency reform at the beginning of 2005 and we dropped six zeros from our currency. Second, we experienced high growth rates while inflation was falling. I can say that the Turkish economy has left behind the boom-bust cycle of growth and has been growing for the last eighteen quarters consecutively. Additionally, the sources of growth have changed, as well. Third, the declining trend of the ratio of public debt to national income has contributed both to the fight against inflation and the relative stability in financial markets. All these developments through the decisive implementation of policies have reflected themselves in reducing uncertainty and increasing predictability, strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals, increasing resilience to shocks and changing the dynamics of the economy bringing the private sector to the forefront; rising productivity, changing behaviors and increasing competition. All in all, it is clear that the Turkish economy has been undergoing a structural transformation since 2001. After going through a deep structural transformation, it is safe to say that the Turkish economy has gradually been normalized. According to our studies, the impact of decisions of short-term interest                                                       2  BIS. (1998). “The Transmission of Monetary Policy in Emerging Market Economies”. BIS Policy Papers No. 3. 2 BIS Review 88/2006 
rates on inflation and on the economy is observed up to 18 and 9 months respectively in Turkey. We also calculated that the lag has been lengthening as we progress with the structural transformation. Dear participants, The second challenge of central banks in some emerging economies is dollarization. In fact, the issue of dollarization has become a common characteristic of many emerging markets like Turkey since the beginning of the 1990s. Both our experience and that of Latin American economies clearly indicate that dollarization increases the fragilities of almost every sector of the economy, namely the real sector, public sector and financial sector. From the perspective of the real sector, dollarization appears in several respects. First, it affects pricing behaviors. In other words, a high level of dollarization is likely to cause a higher pass-through effect of exchange rates on inflation. Besides, in countries where derivatives markets are not well developed, the balance sheet effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the private sector also has important implications considering the level of exposure to exchange rate risk. From the perspective of the public sector, a currency mismatch problem arises, given that the greater part of government revenues are denominated in national currency, while the part of liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. Regarding the financial sector, we observe similar effects. With negative impacts on the balance sheets of financial intermediaries, dollarization raises the possibility of default risk and liquidity risk in the sector, and then distorts effective credit allocation of available resources. All these fragilities caused by dollarization heavily affect the way central banks implement their policies by weakening the impact of monetary policy decisions. Besides, dollarization in emerging economies threatens central banking by causing instability and uncertainty in money demand, which in turn makes it hard to predict money supply and control inflation. Dear guests, When we look at the Turkish case, we see that dollarization has its roots in macroeconomic instability, inefficient market regulations and lack of credibility of economic policies in one hand; predictable exchange rates in the other hand. The high and chronic inflation period led economic agents to invest simply in foreign currency, which is the easiest and least costly method of risk aversion. In addition, market regulations such as blanket guarantee on foreign exchange deposits and lack of supervision supported the process of dollarization, as well. As of 2001, Turkey was one of the most dollarized emerging market economies with a share of 58.2 percent of foreign exchange deposits in total deposits. The same ratio was 49.3 percent in Romania, 46.8 percent in Russia and 47 percent in Peru, which were generally accepted as highly dollarized economies. Today, looking ahead from the year 2001 we have been experiencing a reverse dollarization for the last four years. As of August 2006, the ratio of foreign exchange deposits to total deposits decreased to 36.7 percent. Similarly, the ratio of investment instruments denominated in domestic currency has pursued an increasing trend, while that of foreign currency has been decreasing accordingly. I can say that as long as the floating exchange rate regime is implemented properly and inflation is kept under control through credible macroeconomic policies, the floating exchange rate regime along with the inflation-targeting regime has a crucial role in decreasing the level of dollarization. However, I would like to add that the level of dollarization is not declining fast, and it is still high. Although diminishing to some extent, we are still observing some lingering behaviors inherited from the past inflation period. That is why it is so important to continue with current policies and structural reforms. Dear participants, The third factor that stands as a challenge for central banking is sustainability of fiscal discipline in emerging economies. BIS Review 88/2006 3 
It is a challenge because of its impacts not only on inflation through aggregate demand, but also on financial stability since concerns about the sustainability of fiscal policy are likely to influence economic variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and other measures of risk premium. In this context, what differs in many emerging markets is the role of fiscal dominance, a situation in which fiscal policy ultimately governs price determination in financial markets3, crowds out available sources, disrupts effective credit allocation in the economy, and impairs the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand. The high level of fiscal dominance in many emerging market countries is associated with the high level of public sector borrowing requirements. Additionally, vulnerability in public sectors’ balance sheet and debt structure may constitute a barrier to central banks’ policy decisions such as those on short-term interest rate hikes. Such fiscal distortions are rare in industrialized economies and hence, these economies are less susceptible to adverse shocks coming from the fiscal side. Dear guests, In addition to the issues that I have mentioned, there are in my opinion two further issues related to fiscal policy and public debt management that cause challenges in many emerging market economies like Turkey. The first one is the relatively shorter maturity of debt compared to that of developed countries and the other is the “original sin” problem, which is presented in the literature by Eichengreen and Haussmann.4  In this context, emerging countries are forced to borrow in units of currencies that they are basically unable to issue. All these concerns have direct impact on the fragility of financial markets. Therefore, any doubt over the sustainability of fiscal discipline causes volatility in financial variables and has a high possibility of endangering central bank goals. In the case of Turkey, when we look back, we see that the period of high and variable inflation coincides with high public deficit being financed by the Central Bank. An increasing lack of fiscal discipline in public expenditures and further widening of budget deficits caused inflation to get out of control and the public sector borrowing requirement to grow continuously. This structure affected the banking system, as well. The Turkish banking sector was not able to perform its intermediary function effectively. Instead, the sector mostly financed public sector deficits. Looking to the present, on the other hand, one of the most important changes is that the Central Bank of Turkey no longer extends credits to the Treasury or any other public institution by the amendment made in its Law in 2001. And it is no coincidence that inflation has been on a declining trend since then. Moreover, tight fiscal policies have been put into practice for the last five years. A very high level of primary surplus, that is 6.5 percent, has been targeted. The positive effect of these measures has started to be observed in several areas. The ratio of consolidated budget deficit to gross national product turned into surplus of 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 2006. And the ratio of public sector net debt stock to gross national product decreased from 90.5 percent in 2001 to 52.8 percent in the first quarter of 2006. In fact, public sector net debt stock is on a downward path converging towards the Maastricht criterion. And maturities are becoming longer. More importantly, the issue of public debt sustainability is no longer at the top of the agenda, implying decreasing pressure in financial markets. I want to stress here again that the continuation of tight fiscal policies and high primary surplus is quite important in terms of both the price stability objective and the financial stability issue. Dear participants, The last concept in central banking that I want to mention today is the role of expectations management in emerging market economies.                                                       3  Moreno, R. (2002). “Fiscal Issues and Central Banking in Emerging Economies: An Overview”. Meeting held at the BIS in December 2002. 4  Eichengreen, B., Haussmann, R. (1999). “Exchange Rates and Financial Fragility”. NBER Working Paper 7418. 4 BIS Review 88/2006 
As economic literature tells us, and you very well know, the management of expectations is of great importance for every central banker. Quoting Michael Woodford5, “For successful monetary policy is not so much a matter of effective control of overnight interest rates as it is of shaping market expectations of the way in which interest rates, inflation, and income are likely to evolve over the coming year and later”. I believe it is the expectations that form a bridge between short-term interest rates and long-term interest rates. The more the expectations converge to the targets, the greater the likelihood of the success of the policies. Also, the less volatile the expectations are, the more stable and predictable the effect of monetary policy on the economy is. However, when it comes to emerging market economies, the functioning of expectations differs from developed countries. To be more precise, expectations affect the economy more heavily than other channels in many emerging market countries with a high inflationary past6. We at the Central Bank of Turkey are also familiar with this experience. The impact of short-term interest rate decisions is observed within a much shorter period of time through the expectations channel, which has made this channel the most effective one in Turkey so far. In this context, what I find particularly critical to my experience is that the high inflationary history of emerging market countries stands as a real challenge to expectations management in several respects. One of the reasons is the lack of credibility resulted from the high and chronic inflation period in emerging economies. Since these periods can be characterized by the monetization of public debts by sources of central banks or central banks having objectives other than and sometimes even contradicting price stability, economic agents tend to have doubts about the credibility of central bank policies. Not to mention that this constitutes a limit to the effectiveness of monetary policies. The other one is known as “inflationary psychology” or “inflation scare”. To be more precise, because of high and volatile inflationary periods, economic agents in emerging economies are more inclined to exaggerate adverse effects than in any other economy that has price stability. Thus, a seasonal rise in inflation may immediately lead to deterioration in inflation expectations and higher prices with little transitional impact on the level of economic activity. At this point, given the importance of expectations management, a key aspect of the policy framework is transparency and communication. Here, it is impossible not to agree with Paul Volcker, who said; “I have one lesson indelible in my brain: don’t let inflation get ingrained. Once that happens, there’s too much agony in stopping the momentum.”7Referring to the Turkish case, I can say that the thirty-year experience of high and chronic inflation has made us face the challenge of convincing both the public and the financial markets that we are committed to bringing inflation down and maintaining price stability. In every platform we participated and in every announcement we made, we emphasized our policy objective, which is to achieve and maintain price stability, the reasons underlying our policy implementations and the importance of having a medium-term vision in terms of lagged effect of policy decisions. To this end, we try to use communication policy effectively as an important part of the inflation-targeting regime. We base our communication policy on the grounds of trust, transparency, consistency and decisiveness. I believe this is not peculiar to the Turkish case. Many central bankers in emerging market countries have to deal with the drawbacks of a past of high and chronic inflation and thus incredible policies. And it is by all means clear that designing a communication strategy is not easy under these circumstances. As you may all agree, the concept of communication itself is a dynamic issue. Therefore, given the importance of effective communication, it is important to note that we at the Central Bank of Turkey have been working continuously on improving our communication policy.                                                       5  Woodford, M.

Dear guests, There is no doubt that central banking can be considered as a combination of positive sciences and human psychology, or as you could say, the union of science and art. I can safely say that for a central banker of an emerging market country, managing monetary policy has more qualifications as an art, rather than a science. As Mervin King, the Governor of the Bank of England, once said, “I have raised more questions than I have answered, perhaps that is what happens when you become a central banker”8. I hope that you will find some of the answers in the panel. Thank you.                                                       8 King, M. (2004). “The Institutions of Monetary Policy”.

Rick Houenipwela: Launching of Solomon Islands new and revised bank notes Remarks by Mr Rick Houenipwela, Governor of the Central Bank of Solomon Islands, at the launching of Solomon Islands new $100 bank note and the upgraded $2 bank note, Honiara, 2 September 2006. *      *      * Hon Minister of Finance  Hon Ministers of the Crown  Hon Leader of the Opposition Group  Hon Members of Parliament  Heads and Representatives of Diplomatic Missions  Chairman, CEMA  Heads & representatives of financial institutions  Ladies & Gentlemen  On behalf of the Board of Directors, the Management and staff of the Central Bank, I am very pleased that you have accepted our invitation to this morning’s event - the launching of the Solomon Islands $100 bank note and the revised $2 bank note.  At its introduction in April 1977, the national currency comprised of $2, $5 and $10 in bank notes; and in coins denomination there was 1cent, 2cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents and $1 Nguzunguzu. The $20 bank note came in 1980, and six years later the $50 bank note was introduced. As regards coins, the 50 cents was the last introduction in 1988.  Currency development is important the development of any sovereign country. For Solomon Islands, currency plays more than its traditional role as a medium of exchange. As I will discuss later, it has socio-economic dimensions to its use and purpose. But we do not print notes or mint coins at the whim of the Governor of the Central Bank. As a member of the global family of currency issuers, the Central Bank observe the internationally accepted principle that the highest value denomination should account for not more than 20% of the number of notes in circulation and not more than 60% of the value of the notes in circulation.  In Solomon Islands currency development is influenced by various socio-economic factors. For example, in developing this high-value denomination we considered a variety of factors including the size and distribution of the population, trends in volumes and types of trading activities, wage levels, various means of payment, different mediums of cash disbursement, availability of banking facilities, inflation and the general economic situation in the country. As well, assessments of the demand on each denomination have to be done, and these showed an over reliance [83% of total currency in circulation] on the $50, indicating the need for a higher denomination. But equally important is the need to ascertain the public’s acceptance and readiness for a higher value bank note. The results convinced the Board it was time to introduce the $100 bank note.  The technical work then kicked in with consultations on a theme and colour schemes with various groups and individuals. As part of this process, the Central Bank Board appointed a “Bank Note Committee”. [one of the members was the late Charles Manata]. This group, headed by the Deputy Governor, comprised of Solomon Islands artists, the Director of National Museum and selected CBSI managers, developed and advised the Board on the theme, various features and colouring schemes. Upon approval by the Board, the printers were then engaged in the drawings, developing security and other technical features.  A number of options were developed. These went through fairly intensive scrutiny in the Bank, after which an endorsed sample of the note was printed, with all the specifications - size, colour scheme and of course security features - for ministerial approval. Actual printing did not start until the final proof note – which had the exact specifications approved by the Minister – received a final approval by the CBSI Board.  From the time initial assessments on the need for a higher value denomination were made to the time when the final proof note went to print, it was about five years. It took another 8 months before we took delivery of the first consignment of the note on Thursday this week. I should add that the transportation and delivery of our currency stocks are handled under very heavy security arrangements – as it would have been witnessed on Thursday morning.  BIS Review 88/2006 1 
Ladies and gentlemen, I am recounting all this to reiterate three points: first, that printing our currency is a very complicated, highly security-conscious and sophisticated technical task, requiring long lead times, involving various agencies and groups, and a lot of tedious processes. Secondly, this is necessary to ensure not only a high quality product, but more so, a high level of security finished note. And thirdly, it is to assure the public that contrary to rumours floating in Honiara, the delivery of the new $100 bank note has nothing to do with the expectations by members of the cult group, the Family Charity Fund, of their millions of dollars. Our stocks of currency are real bank notes and they do not belong to FCF as has been claimed. I assure you, the notes are safe and secure in the Central Bank vault.  Ladies and gentlemen, given recent counterfeiting incidences of the $50, I wish to also assure the public that the development of the $100 bank note has ensured security features that effectively reduce any chance for counterfeiting. The new note carries added visible security features that can be easily seen without the need for a machine. It incorporates additional security to both the paper and print specifications.  As noted already, all our currency denominations have different themes. The bank notes portray various themes and features of Solomon Islands. This time the new $100 bank note carries the theme of the rural sector and its contribution to the national economy. Portrayed by the coconut, this signifies rural livelihood, social and economic activities. The Central Bank is thrilled that today’s launching coincides with the World Coconut Day event. The $100 bank note is a commemoration of the labour and contribution by all our farmers, fishermen, men, women and children in rural villages through our country. Despite all odds, you have demonstrated resilience and commitment year in year out just getting on with life. We salute you!  Finally, before I forget, the Central Bank has also revised the $2 bank note back to paper note. This is due to the disappointing experience we have with the polymer, a polypropylene plastic. While the plastic is durable, as you will all have experienced, the colour does not survive its expected life in circulation, which is costly to the economy. The CBSI Board has therefore decided to revert back to the old paper note. So this morning we also have the revised $2 bank note, which has all the normal features except the addition of the national flag, for re-launching.  Ladies and Gentlemen, let me say again that I am very grateful that are able to come – and we at the Bank are especially honoured by your presence of the Hon Minister for this morning’s event.  Thank you and may God bless you. 2 BIS Review 88/2006 
V Leeladhar: IT for business excellence  Address by Mr V Leeladhar, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Banktec (India's Bank Tech Summit), Mumbai, 21 September 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to be present here to share a few thoughts on one of the important drivers of banking business in the world. Information Technology or IT has made substantial inroads into the financial sector, it has in fact transformed the way banking operations are conducted. The benefits brought about by IT in handling large processing volumes, in providing for quick, safe transaction processing, economies of scale and in expanding the reach and coverage of banking services, and above all product innovation have all been enormous.  Today’s banking business has become most challenging with customer expectations rising as each day passes by. This calls for substantive changes in the way in which banks do the business and in the nature of products they offer. If the well accepted principle of Six Sigma that signifies excellence in business processes will have to happen in the Indian financial sector, I have no doubt that the IT has to play a crucial role. Let me commence by flagging some issues which stem from extensive use of IT. Organisations that understand and tackle these issues (being very common perceptions let me call them “premises”) will be in a better position to harness the opportunities. This may well differentiate a winner from a looser.  • The most common premise is that for successful technological improvements, people with the right aptitude are required; many organisations even conduct aptitude tests to select the ‘right’ type of personnel. My own experience is that attitude is more important than aptitude. A person who is willing to learn is a better asset than one who is technology savvy but refuses to change. • Another premise is that if technological changes are implemented at lower levels, these can be replicated at all tiers of the organisation. This may not be always the case. Most successful technological updations have followed the ‘Top-Down’ approach, where the changes are not merely triggered from the Top but are followed religiously by the top most official in the hierarchy. Most organisations which have effective Information Security (IS) policies are those where the commitment and implementation levels commence from the top and percolate downwards. • A common premise about technology is that technology provides solutions for all problem situations. While this may be generally true, it is very often the case that there are technological solutions for operational problems, but operational restrictions cannot come to the aid of technological problems. In other words, problems and issues relating to the technology have to be sorted by means of changes in the technological solution itself. All of us must have experienced vendors who have provided technology solutions suggesting that some procedures or that some of the environmental aspects could be modified to suit the technological process which has been implemented. This is a case for certain failure. The case of a new bank which commenced its operations by dispensing away with the savings bank pass books had to beat a hasty retreat and give the option to its customers by providing a technological solution - customers could take print outs of their statement of accounts at any time from their own system! • Yet another premise is that the process of change can be forced upon people. It is now widely accepted that change has to be from within and external forces only facilitate or accelerate the process of change. The old adage of ‘You can take the horse to the water but cannot make it drink’ is relevant in this context. A case in point pertains to the use of cards by customers of banks. A decade ago, banks had to offer incentives to customers to use cards for their transactions, and there was general reluctance to use the card by even the discerning customer. Today, customers have realised that the cards offer better convenience and have changed over to large scale usage of the cards, based on their conviction. That the Direct Selling Agents employed by banks hastened the process of migration is an accepted fact, but this was not the major factor in the change process. BIS Review 88/2006 1 
• Perhaps the most important premise relating to change pertains to the relationship between security and stability. If a change process has to be successful, there has to be a harmonious balance between the perceived levels of insecurity and instability by the participants in the change process. Even if one of these factors has a higher perceived weightage, the change becomes difficult to implement. In a nutshell, it is essential that managing change is taken as a very serious task with the complete commitment and support from the Top levels of all organisations. This is particularly more relevant in banks, where personnel manning the front desk are the most important link between the bank and the customer can make or break a change. A bank staff telling a customer ‘This new system implemented by my bank takes a very long time; please wait for updating your pass book’ or tells ‘We have moved to a Core Banking Solution; please leave your cheque requisition slip and come back after two days for the cheque book’ is sure enough to wreck the entire change process and image building that the bank has ambitiously embarked upon.  Having given a gist of the need to effectively manage change, let me now outline some of the areas which offer major challenges in the area of large scale technological upgradation.  At the top of the pyramid of challenges is the choice of the right technological solution. Most often than not, we are guided by vendor presentations and experiences of other organisations in the process of selection and we end up in getting a system which may not necessarily be the best one for the bank concerned. While broad technological contours may be the same, customisation may hold the key to providing the correct system for each individual organisation. I am reminded of the case of a bank which started installing Cash Dispensing Machines a few years ago, based on some experiences of the West. Today, we have observed that Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) with multi-functional and regional language capabilities are being construed as the optimal fit for cash based and other related transactions of customers. The next challenge relates to the level of security in the usage of IT based systems in banks. Much has been said and detailed about the need for fool proof security systems in banks, but we find that security breaches and the consequent perpetuation of frauds are also taking place. Security in banking applications is not a feature but a built-in process. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which is positioned as a very advanced security mechanism may be brought to nought if there is a compromise of the smart cards housing the digital signature, by the holder and he shares the card with an unauthorised person. Thus, the entire chain of procedures and components of a system have to be looked at in a holistic manner to ensure that security is all pervasive across the entire chain of activities.  Another important challenge facing all of us is the need for standardisation. While standardisation does not mean that the same uniform systems are used across all banks, the bare minimum requirements to ensure inter-operability has to be provided for. With margins across different partners in business thinning, it is essential that banks take up Straight Through processing and Inter-operability as key issues to be addressed in all their technological implementations. The usage of the SFMS of the IDRBT, it is hoped, will address this concern to a large extent. This is also a challenge which I am sure that the IDRBT will also take up in right earnest for the benefit of the financial sector as a whole. The growth in mobile communications and the exponential usage of mobile telephony by India’s masses is an aspect which in my view, banks have to look upon as an opportunity to harness to their benefit. The power of the chip in the mobile phone is enormous and its usage for secure banking transactions needs to be examined and provided for.  I would also like to touch on another challenge which banks are slowly overcoming. The need for regular, sustained IS audit is being highlighted by the Reserve Bank for some time now. While some initiatives have been taken by banks towards achieving this, much more needs to be done. The speed with which IT implementation and upgradation is being done may outpace the frequency of IS Audit and it is in the best interests of banks that this vital activity is given due importance. IT also facilitates a host of other functions which banks have been hitherto performing through manual operations. Let me take up the case of verification of the genuineness of the customer - the Know Your Customer or KYC factor. Technology facilitates easier access to verification of information on a real time basis. Since IT tools provide a scientific and almost real time monitoring and analysis of funds movement, this would help a great deal in ensuring compliance to Anti-Money laundering requirements. Many IT based banking solutions have incorporated sophisticated algorithms and 2 BIS Review 88/2006 
comprehensive permutations and combinations to provide alerts on a real time basis. Such a facilitation may well be impossible using manual means. Another vital aspect that has to be taken cognisance of is that technological deployment must always be consistent with the levels of expertise in each bank as well as the nature and sophistication of its customers. Alternatively it is important to train all the stake holders to ensure a smooth technological transformation. Many of you must have had occasion to read the book ‘Freakonomics’ by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner. The narrative there on the lifetime episode of Paul Feldman on the sale of the American bread - bagels is an eye opener. He commenced sale of the bagels in an unsupervised manner which led to a situation where the buyers did not always pay for their offtakes. Nevertheless the recovery rate was rather encouraging. He further studied the behaviour-versus-payment patterns and came out with correlations - such as the increased payments during Christmas or even during pleasant weather situations while catastrophies (such as the 9/11 event) or bad weather resulted in lesser payment realisations. Based on this he replanned his strategies. Banks could do well to keep this story in their minds while planning so that their products and services meet employee and customer requirements - all of which provide improved results for banks in the long run. Let me now conclude on a positive note. Indian banks have proved that IT based upgradation of banking services can be achieved within short time spans and at remarkably accurate levels. We have some of the largest core banking implementations in the world, we have a unique network for the exclusive use of banks in the form of the INFINET; banks have their own corporate intra-nets which are functioning effectively; we have the enabling legal infrastructure for large scale IT deployment and able all, we have a large customer population which has adapted well to the changes using Technology. These do give us comfort, but let these not lead us to complacency. As India has made a place in the IT arena, it may not be long before we make our presence felt in an IT enabled banking world as well. Indian Banks have always risen up to challenges and have successfully overcome them. Today’s success mantra for achieving excellence lies in the optimal use of technology in a manner where the process of change is managed well enough to blend with customer expectations of excellent customer service. This in turn would result in better house keeping and improved bottom lines for the banks and above all in overall systemic efficiency.  My best wishes to all of you and may your efforts lead to creation of IT based bank models of the morrow. I wish you all fruitful deliberations during the day.  Thank you. BIS Review 88/2006 3 
Y V Reddy: The role of financial education – the Indian case Inaugural address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the International Conference on Financial Education, organised by the OECD and co-hosted by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority, New Delhi, 21 September 2006.  *      *      * Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I am thankful to Shri Swarup for inviting me to this august gathering. The Conference represents an important step by the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) to distil from the experiences of other countries in its quest for enhancing the levels of financial education in our country. The collaboration with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) which has been playing a pivotal role in this respect is a laudable idea which will certainly contribute to furthering the cause of financial education. The eminence of several speakers adds great value to the discussions. We in the Reserve Bank are also keen on this subject and look forward to benefit from the deliberations of this Conference.  My remarks on this occasion will be structured along the following lines. I will provide some introduction on the importance of this topic in modern day societies, followed by an overview of the global practice in this area. Any discussion on financial education in India would need to acknowledge the Indian realities as well. The concluding thoughts are in the nature of possible approaches towards expanding the outreach of financial education in India.  Background Financial education can broadly be defined as the capacity to have familiarity with and understanding of financial market products, especially rewards and risks in order to make informed choices. Viewed from this standpoint, financial education primarily relates to personal financial education to enable individuals to take effective actions to improve overall well-being and avoid distress in matters that are financial.  The focus of any discussion on financial education is primarily on the individual, who usually has limited resources and skills to appreciate the complexities of financial dealings with financial intermediaries on matters relating to personal finance on a day-to-day basis. The process of economic reforms, which includes deregulation and marketisation, should have educating and empowering the common person to participate in the financial marketplace with knowledge and confidence, as a critical component of public policy.  The need for financial education is felt in the developed and the developing countries alike. In the developed countries, the increasing number and complexity of financial products, the continuing shift in responsibility for providing social security from governments and financial institutions to individuals, and the growing importance of individual retirement planning make it imperative that financial education be provided to all.  In the developing countries also, the increasing participation of a growing number of consumers in newly developing financial markets will necessitate the provision of financial education – if these markets are to expand and operate efficiently. In addition, the substantial growth of international transactions during the last decade, resulting from new technologies and the growing international mobility of individuals, makes the improvement in financial education, increasingly, an international concern. From a regulatory perspective, financial education empowers the common person and thus reduces the burden of protecting the common person from the elements of market failure, attributable to, de facto, information asymmetries. For example, the emphasis on market discipline, as one of the three pillars of banking regulation, especially under Basel II, is best served by participation of financially literate bank customers in the financial marketplace.  Financial education can make a difference not only in the quality of life that individuals can afford, but also the integrity and quality of markets. It can provide individuals with basic tools for budgeting, help them to acquire the discipline to save and thus, ensure that they can enjoy a dignified life after BIS Review 87/2006 1 
retirement. Financially educated consumers, in turn, can benefit the economy by encouraging genuine competition, forcing the service providers to innovate and improve their levels of efficiency.  Global practices It has been said, particularly in the context of the developed economies that while the young do not save enough and do not fully understand the need for investments for future, many of the elderly tend to feel the pinch of poverty. In this background, priority need to be accorded to financial education.  For example, in the UK, the Financial Services Authority has launched the biggest ever campaign to improve the financial skills of the population and imparting education to enable a better appreciation of the risks and rewards inherent in financial instruments.  The US Treasury established its Office of Financial Education in 2002. The Office works to promote access to the financial education tools that can help all US citizens make wiser choices in all areas of personal financial management, with a special emphasis on saving, credit management, home ownership and retirement planning. The Financial Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC), established by the Congress in 2003 through the passage of the Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act, was created with the purpose of improving the financial literacy and education of persons in the United States through development of a national strategy to promote financial literacy and education. The Federal Reserve, along with numerous other federal government agencies, is a member of this commission, which is supported by the Office of Financial Education. The Federal Reserve System’s recently redesigned financial education website, FederalReserveEducation.org, is dovetailed to increase the use of Federal Reserve educational materials and promote financial education in the classroom. The website has material intended for the general public, as well as materials specifically geared toward teachers and high school and college students. It provides easy access to free educational materials, a resource search engine for teachers, and games for various ages and knowledge levels. The other regional Feds also have various interactive on-line programmes on their website designed to generate awareness about better financial management and assessment of one's own financial position.  In Australia, the Government established a National Consumer and Financial Literacy Taskforce in 2002, which recommended the institution of the Financial Literacy Foundation in 2005. Working closely with states and territories, the Foundation has produced a National Curriculum Framework for Financial Literacy to provide benchmarks for teaching the school children the importance of managing their money.  In Malaysia, the Financial Sector Master Plan, launched in 2001, includes a 10-year consumer education program. This agenda includes infrastructure and institutional capacity development in the areas of financial education, advisory services, distress management and rehabilitation. For this purpose, the Bank Negara Malaysia in partnership with the financial industry and other government agencies, has introduced the Financial Mediation Bureau, Deposit Insurance Scheme, Basic Banking Services Framework as well as created a new class of licensed Financial Advisers. Savings and education programs are also being promoted in schools. A one-stop centre has recently been established within the central bank for the public to obtain information about financial services in Malaysia and to provide face-to-face customer service on general enquiries and complaints. These initiatives have been reinforced by high levels of transparency and disclosure. In collaboration with the government agencies, Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a national financial education programme (MoneySENSE) to enhance financial literacy and self-reliance of consumers. The programme covers three tiers of financial literacy: basic money management covers skills in budgeting and saving as also tips on responsible use of credit (tier I); equipping citizens with the skills and knowledge to plan for their long-term financial needs (tier II); and imparting knowledge about different investment products and skills for investing (tier III). Above all, the OECD has been taking a pro-active initiative in generating awareness about financial education. It has recently released a major international study on financial education titled 'Improving Financial Literacy' encompassing practical guidelines on good practices in financial education and awareness. These guidelines, in the form of a non-binding recommendation, are designed to help countries devise and implement effective financial education programmes, drawing from the best practices in this area in OECD countries. They promote the role of all the main stakeholders in financial education: governments, financial institutions, employers, trade unions and consumer groups. 2 BIS Review 87/2006 
In addition, they also draw a clear distinction between public information provided by the government and regulatory authorities, and that supplied by the financial analysts.  It is also important to devise ways to ascertain whether financial education has achieved its objective, such as generating increased consumer awareness or a changed behaviour, a point I will return to a little later. The balance of evidence, however, suggests that such programmes tend to be effective. For instance, in the United States, it has been observed that workers increase their participation in retirement savings plans funded by employee and employer contributions when the latter offers financial education programmes, whether in the form of brochures or seminars. Consumers who attend one-on-one counselling sessions on their personal finances have fewer delinquencies. Indian realities Prior to the initiation of financial sector reforms in the early 1990s, the Indian financial system essentially catered to the needs of planned development. Customers had little choice in financial instruments. The segmented and underdeveloped financial markets meant that their exposure to risk was also limited. In such a situation, customers could employ their basic skills to invest in simple financial products with assured returns, unconcerned about their risks. The relevance of financial education was, at best, limited.  Pursuant to the process of globalisation, the economic and financial landscape in India is undergoing a significant transformation. In the process, the economy has become more diversified with new sources of growth. In tandem with these changes, we have seen the modernisation of the financial sector that has also become increasingly more diversified to meet the new requirements of the economy. The financial sector has also increasingly leveraged on advances in technology which has significantly changed the way financial business is being conducted. As market advances continue to expand the range of financial products and services, consumers are being faced with increasingly multifaceted choices and options in the management of their personal finances and exposure to a gamut of risks. In this complex financial landscape, it becomes important for consumers to have improved access to information. Significant changes have also occurred in the social sphere. While on the one hand, costs of education have increased substantially, the longevity levels have also risen, on the other. Taken together, this implies that the elderly are now required to achieve a constant rebalancing of their consumption and investment portfolios. The increased life expectancy has also compelled employers to move away from ad hoc funded superannuation schemes to defined contribution schemes. At the same time, the advances in information technology have lowered the costs of information acquisition and processing as also of searching a job. This, in turn, has significantly raised job mobility with attendant implications for family size and expenditure patterns.  Financial education assumes importance in this changed financial environment. In considering means to improve the financial status of families, financial education can play a critical role by equipping consumers with the knowledge required to choose from a myriad of financial products and providers. In addition, financial education can help provide individuals with the knowledge necessary to create household budgets, initiate savings plans, manage debt, and make strategic investment decisions for their retirement or for their children's education. Being educated financially also enables individuals to better appreciate the possible contingencies and save for a rainy day, in an appropriate manner. It can empower consumers to become better shoppers, allowing them to procure goods and services at lower cost. This process, in turn, raises consumers' real purchasing power and multiplies the opportunities for them to consume, save, or invest. Having these basic financial planning skills can help families to meet their near-term obligations and maximise their longer-term financial well-being. Financial education is also an integral component of customer protection. Despite concerted efforts, the current state of transparency coupled with the difficulty of consumers in identifying and understanding the fine print from the large volume of convoluted information, leads to an information asymmetry between the financial intermediary and the customer. For example, customers are often penalised for minor violations in repayments, although they have limited redressal mechanisms to rectify deficiencies in service by banks, rendering the banker-customer relationship one of unequals. In this relationship, it is the principal, that is, the depositor, who is actually far less powerful than the agent, that is, the bank. The representations received in regard to levying of unreasonably high service or user charges and enhancement of user charges without proper and prior intimation, and the growing number of customer complaints against the banks, also testify to this fact. In this context, BIS Review 87/2006 3 
financial education may help to prevent vulnerable consumers from falling prey to financially disquieting credit arrangements.  There are however, issues that would need to be addressed upfront in the Indian context. First, the regional profile in our country is diversified, with people across different regions being typically conversant in their vernacular languages. Second, there exists a wide divergence in literacy levels across States. Thus, for instance, in several States and union territories, the literacy rates in 2001 were well above the national average of 65.4 per cent; in contrast, there were also regions where literacy levels have remained perennially low. Third, the dependency ratio varies markedly across states. Fourth, within a State, there are marked differences between rural and urban areas. Fifth, there is also a perceptible variation in the penetration of banking across regions. Taken together, these unique conditions in our country create a role for the public policy to devise enabling mechanisms to improve the levels of financial education, reckoning the regional differences. To the extent the common person is better able to understand and appreciate the need for financial education, the task of the financial regulators is greatly simplified, lowering the overall costs of regulation.  Possible approaches It is an imperative of increasing globalisation that the difference in the pace of growth of the financial sector and financial education be minimized. There are several ways to go about this process. For purposes of illustration, these can be classified as institutional mechanisms, delivery mechanisms and decentralisation of efforts.  Institutional mechanisms As regards the institutional mechanism, there is near consensus on the fact that any attempt at expanding the outreach of financial education needs to start at the grass-roots. Present day school pass-outs need to be a lot more financially literate than their parents were, if they are to manage their personal finances successfully through life. In addition, universities and business schools have an important role in training financial specialists able to provide the public with high quality advice on financial matters.  Yet another channel for imparting financial education could be the workplace where it can reach most of the working adults. It would, therefore, be a potent mechanism for providing information about a number of financial services such as retirement schemes and insurance.  The role of financial institutions in providing financial education, not only to the clients but also to their own staff, needs to be better defined and further promoted. More information is needed at both international and national levels on good programmes and practices and on the ways to promote access to financial services by harnessing the role of non-government organisations (NGOs).  International organisations are well-positioned to coordinate international surveys and studies on the various aspects of financial education, to evaluate the comparative efficiency of various financial education programmes, and to develop guidelines and good practices for policymakers for implementation. International agencies can also provide a forum where countries can compare and discuss strategies to educate consumers about financial issues.  Several governments and central banks, either directly or indirectly, are actively involved in the provision of financial education about consumer credit, investment, and other financial issues, often as part of a public policy campaign to improve the protection of individual borrowers and investors, for instance, as part of the ongoing pension reform efforts. Exchange of experiences amongst central banks would thus be productive. Delivery mechanisms The delivery mechanisms for imparting financial education can be manifold. However, the content and delivery of financial education should correspond to the needs of specific sub-groups of consumers that is, the young or elderly, less or better educated, well- or ill-informed. Presentations, lectures, conferences, symposia, training courses and seminars can be actively utilised for this purpose.  Second, publications in diverse forms, including books, brochures, magazines, booklets/pamphlets, direct mail documents, can also be useful in this regard.  4 BIS Review 87/2006 
Third, leveraging information technology through concerted media campaigns using all possible avenues of mass communication can be expected to impart greater efficacy to the process. Other methods include advisory services from institutions, including the fast growing telecommunication services.  Not only the supply of financial education, but also the demand is very important. Most delivery channels are good for those who are already interested in particular topics. An important challenge is to create demand for financial information and education.  Decentralisation of efforts Given the unique conditions in our country, any attempt at expanding the outreach of financial education should take cognisance of the role of regional differences in language, workforce and penetration of finance. Thus, banks with strong presence across different regions could explore the possibility of introducing a local-language based web-site providing details of facilities for customers.  Second, in recent times, the explosion of the internet has altered the relationship between financial organisations and its clientele. Organisations can examine ways to better communicate with both the prospective and existing clients by enriching the information content of their website on the lines of those practiced in the mature markets.  Third, credit counselling can be a potent tool for financial entities to expand the reach of financial education.  Fourth, it might be of interest for reputed organisations like the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) to conduct surveys at periodic intervals to ascertain the degree of consumer awareness about financial products and services. The findings emanating from such studies could be shared with financial entities to enable them to address the gaps in their service delivery and promote informed decision-making.  Fifth, several bodies, such as the Financial Planning Standards Board of India (FPSBI), a professional standards setting body constituted with public-private enterprise, are reportedly making proactive efforts to uniformly regulate personal financial planning practitioners. Much more of such efforts will be required to guide the development and promotion of standards for financial planning professionals to benefit and protect the public in the country. Role of the RBI The RBI, on its part, wishes to advance the cause of financial education in our country as part of an overall strategy. The strategy pursued in this regard can be elucidated as follows. Concerted efforts are underway to expand the reach of formal finance in view of recent emphasis on financial inclusion. This needs to be buttressed with financial education to generate greater customer awareness and understanding of financial products and services. Concurrently, a process of credit counselling is being encouraged to help all borrowers, but particularly those in distress to overcome current financial problems and gain access to the structured financial system. The Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) has also been instituted which is expected to ensure that the banks formulate and adhere to their own comprehensive code of conduct for minimum standards of banking services, which individual customers can legitimately expect. And finally, a Banking Ombudsman Scheme has been instituted for redressal of grievances against deficient banking services, covering all the States and Union Territories.  The RBI has also been exploring the possibility of instituting a Depositor Protection Fund (DPF). The Fund can be utilised towards generating greater awareness for the common man on issues relating to financial education and counselling. This could be complemented with providing greater role to our Regional Offices to promote financial education in their respective jurisdictions.  Conclusion The international co-operation of the kind which OECD and PFRDA have embarked upon is a welcome development. I would like to congratulate them for undertaking this useful initiative and thank them for giving me an opportunity to be a part of this process. BIS Review 87/2006 5 
I have no doubt that this Conference will prove to be an important milestone in the area of financial education for our country.  We, at the RBI, too look forward to benefiting from the deliberations. Thank you. 6 BIS Review 87/2006 
Niklaus Blattner: Financial market infrastructures facing technological, economic and regulatory challenges Summary of a speech by Mr Niklaus Blattner, Deputy Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the XI AWK Group Financial Services Lunch, Zurich, 20 September 2006. The complete speech can be found in German on the Swiss National Bank’s website (www.snb.ch). *      *      * Smoothly and efficiently functioning financial market infrastructures form the backbone of the International Financial Centre of Switzerland. The future of these infrastructures will largely hinge on trends in Europe, which point to stronger consolidation. However, healthy competition is the prerequisite for investment and innovation incentives in a consolidated stock market and settlement environment. This would also contribute to reducing the existing inefficiencies, in particular with regard to the processing of cross-border transactions. Yet a competitive environment will develop only if market participants can choose freely among the different providers and if the infrastructures are interoperable, i.e. if the providers grant each other and their participants mutual non-discriminatory access.  At present, competitive obstacles exist at the technological, economic and regulatory levels. For instance, costs for changing providers are high. Moreover, financial market infrastructures are often operated in “silo” mode – either explicitly or implicitly – with clearing and settlement being handled by only one provider. But silos impede competition. A suitable regulatory framework must therefore be created to strengthen competition. The EU’s new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), for example, is expected to bring about important changes and intensify competition in the European financial market. This development will also influence the future of financial market infrastructures in Switzerland. Against this background, it is certainly crucial for the Swiss financial market infrastructures to persistently foster their competitiveness. They have pursued this strategy so far, and will need to continue doing so in the future. BIS Review 87/2006 1 
Loi M Bakani: Creating a favourable environment for innovative Credit Supplementation Institutions (CSI) in the Asian region Keynote address by Mr Loi M Bakani, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Papua New Guinea, at the 16th Asian Credit Supplementation Institutions Training Programme, Port Moresby, 13-14 September 2006. *      *      * Introduction Distinguished guests, participants, observers, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to address the 16th Asian Credit Supplementation Institutions Confederation Training Programme. I am informed that it is the first time that such training is held in Papua New Guinea. I am thankful to the organisers for selecting Papua New Guinea as the host of this year’s training programme, and it’s a challenge for the Small Business Development Corporation (SBDC) to ensure a successful hosting of the training programme. The programme comprising of lectures and workshops, will run for two (2) days. Most of you are in our country for the first time, and the organizers have been kind enough to include extra days for visits to the National Museum and the National Parliament. A special arrangement was made for the participants to see the popular Hiri Moale Festival and 31st Independence Anniversary celebrations. I extend our warmest welcome to you all and hope you will enjoy your stay in our capital city, Port Moresby and see some of our diverse cultures and traditions. The training theme “Creating a Favourable Environment for Innovative Credit Supplementation Institutions in the Asian Region” is an exciting one. Under this main theme, the scope of the workshop has been broadened to include presenters to share their expert views and knowledge on related subject matters, including: • Impact of Globalisation on Small and Medium Enterprises credit in the Asian Region; • Innovative Policies and Practices of Credit Supplementation Institutions in the Asian Region; and • Financing Small and Medium Enterprises through Credit Guarantee Schemes. The above sub-themes of the workshop are included to provide an objective and comprehensive coverage of the global issues impacting on the growth of the small and medium enterprises in some parts of the Asia-Pacific region and lack of progress in the other parts of the region. To start the discussions on the above sub-themes, let us look at a number of critical problems and issues affecting the advancement of small and medium enterprises in the wake of globalisation. These include, but are not limited to: small and medium enterprises policy and implementation; regulatory framework; entrepreneurial/managerial skills; finance; technology and information resources. Impact of globalisation on small and medium enterprises credit in the Asian region Globalisation can be simply understood as the way in which the world has become a small ‘village’ or ‘community’ as a result of faster transport, communication and technological advancement which in turn resulted in the reduction in the cost of international trade, investment and in doing business (time and space/distance) between places and people. The Asia-Pacific region is part of this globalisation process, which has influenced the pace of growth and patterns in the region over the past decades. Today we see vibrant and strong economies that are in the forefront of influencing the globalisation process itself through increased world trading, capital transfers and investments, skilled labour movements, and technological innovations and their use. There are many that argue, including those in our region, that globalisation has very limited impact on small and medium enterprises in the developing countries compared to those in the developed economies. There are also those who critically argue that globalisation has disadvantaged the small and medium enterprises in countries that do not have appropriate policy framework, regulations, entrepreneurial and managerial skills, finance and technology necessary for competition and survival. BIS Review 87/2006 1 
Although this view has some merit, the reality about globalisation is that, among other positive changes, it eased capital transfers which provided for relatively easier access to funds by credit and supplementation institutions for on-lending to small and medium enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region. As international trade and investments increase, this trend is likely to continue and grow. Innovative policies and practices of Credit Supplementation Institutions in the Asian region One of the major challenges to foster growth and sustainability, particularly in the developing economies, is the design and implementation of appropriate policies on developing small and medium enterprises. In economies where sound policies are in place, the problem may be due to the failure by the government to seriously ensure that those policies are implemented. As most small and medium enterprises in the developing economies do not have comparative advantage compared to large established companies, any attempts to capture niche markets, domestic as well as international, would be difficult unless appropriate government policies are in place and are effectively implemented to provide relief, particularly in the ‘infant’ stages of their growth cycle. Observations from other economies, including Japan, China and Republic of Korea showed that these countries have done very well because of their governments’ policies and focus on encouraging small and medium enterprises to contribute towards economic growth. These are experiences worth noting and studying. Regulation of small and medium enterprises Small and medium enterprises in most countries do not have a specific legal framework to regulate their activities as most governments share the view that too much regulations and unnecessary interference may impact negatively on normal commercial operations. However, small and medium enterprises are expected to abide by all other relevant laws and regulations, including taxation law. This is a subject of contention and therefore I would rather leave it for you to exchange views on it. Financing small and medium enterprises through credit guarantee schemes Amidst all the constraints facing small and medium enterprises, lack of finance or access to finance appears to be one of the main drawbacks for growth and competitiveness. This is a global problem, and we see that in the Asia-Pacific region as well. In some countries of our region, there have been initiatives to create avenues for small and medium enterprises to obtain credit without excessive scrutiny or discrimination by financiers or credit providers. This is done with the backing of governments by enabling the establishment of financial institutions that accommodate and target small and medium enterprises. In economies where the supply of credit is limited, linkage with banks and credit supplementation institutions is the solution. In the case of Papua New Guinea, there are relatively limited credit and supplementation institutions and financial institutions that are willing to provide credit to small and medium enterprises. The problem is even harder for the government-funded credit and supplementation institutions like the Rural Development Bank to meet these credit needs because of the limited annual appropriation in the budget for this purpose. Management skills, information technology and information resources Apart from finance and other constraints lack of or inadequate managerial skills of entrepreneurs/owners of small and medium enterprises can be a negative factor that can lead to their lack of competitiveness and operational sustainability. Financial institutions or credit and supplementation institutions may be willing to grant credit, but the risk associated with lack of knowledge and skills required to run a successful small and medium enterprises can be the influencing factor that prevents the extension of credit. Further, lack of government support to institutions that are established to train and nurture aspiring businessmen and women are not being offered sufficient financial resources in the annual budget. In Papua New Guinea, the Small Business Development Corporation experiences the same problem. Hopefully, the success of this training workshop will be an eye opener for the government to 2 BIS Review 87/2006 
strengthen the capacity of the Corporation to take on more future challenges to assist small and medium enterprises in the country. Technology and information resources The globalisation process has made the world a ‘smaller’ place. We see the economies of the world becoming integrated more closely. Catalysts in the process, among others, are advancement of technology and hence availability of information resource that enables sound business decisions to be made across countries in a timely manner. Every business manager knows that regardless of the size of your business, use of and reliance on technology to produce information upon which business decisions are made is a crucial part of operating a successful business, whether they are small and medium enterprises or a large corporation. Papua New Guinea’s experience The Government of Papua New Guinea had developed a number of policy papers including, Small and Medium Enterprises Policy, Medium Term Development Strategies (MTDS), the National Dialog and Microfinance Policy. In these policy papers, the Government had expressed the important roles of small and medium enterprises as contributors to the long-term sustainable development of the private sector and economic growth of the country. Like in most countries, small and medium enterprises in Papua New Guinea are not regulated, however, they are required to operate in compliance with the relevant laws of the country including taxation requirements. In order for the small and medium enterprises to be successful, adequate government support through agencies tasked with this function need to be enhanced. This would ensure that the small & medium enterprises develop beyond their infant stages and reach self-sustainable levels. Finance There are relatively limited credit and supplementation institutions and financial institutions that are willing to provide credit to small and medium enterprises in the country. The problem is even harder for the Government-funded credit and supplementation institutions like the Rural Development Bank to meet their credit needs because of the limited annual budget appropriation. The development of the microfinance sector through the PNG-ADB Microfinance and Employment Project is an extension of the options that the government wanted to pursue, through the Microfinance Policy, to extend credit to those in the informal and semi-formal sectors. Credit guarantee and facility schemes Credit guarantee schemes seemed to have limited success in Papua New Guinea’s situation, perhaps partly because such schemes are not fully appreciated and understood. The problem also extends to include the government or its institutions that provide guarantees to small and medium enterprises where in most cases such guarantees are not honoured, giving rise to other issues (e.g. Prudential Supervision). Papua New Guinea’s problem appears to do with perception and expectations. For instance, where a guarantee is provided based on political associations and constituency, those who benefit from the credit facility may feel less inclined to repay the credit because they perceive such service by the government or their political leaders as a compensatory factor in return for their votes. There are countless cases that can be shared from the experience of Papua New Guinea Banking Corporation – a former government-owned commercial bank and similar experiences in our Rural Development Bank. Papua New Guinea also had experiences of other credit facilities, one of which was the “small Scale Business Credit Facility” funded by the SBDC, participating commercial banks and the Central Bank. The portion of funding (one-third) by commercial banks was fully guaranteed by the other participants. Due to high defaults the facility was closed several years ago. Another credit facility was the Global Loan Facility (GLF) of K12.0 million provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) in 1991 that was BIS Review 87/2006 3 
fully guaranteed by the PNG Government. Due to various problems including lengthy and stringent process to access credit, the facility was not fully utilised and the European Investment Bank withdrew the scheme in 1998. Conclusion To conclude, we all should remind ourselves that the accelerated pace at which the world is changing is presenting many challenges for small and medium enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region. Small and medium enterprises in our region, as well as in other parts of the world, have similar features and are confronted by similar problems such as the lack of: • Finance; • entrepreneurial/managerial skills; • access to appropriate technology and information systems; and • appropriate policy and guidelines. As practitioners, you are all no doubt better placed to share your views and experiences on how to solve the problems that deny growth, fair competition and survival of small and medium enterprises in this new era of globalisation. However, it is better to embrace change and grow with it, and take advantage of globalisation and benefit from the positive impact it can have. Finally, I trust that the training programme will be rewarding for you all as you share each other’s knowledge and experiences, and endeavour to find answers to some of the constraints faced by small and medium enterprises problems in our region. I wish you every success in your deliberations over the next 2 days. For our overseas participants, I hope that you will enjoy your stay with us and the fact that you are here during our 31st Independence day celebrations, when we display our rich cultural heritage and diverse traditions makes us very happy to be your host. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 87/2006 
Svein Gjedrem: Wealth management in a public setting Introductory statement by Mr Svein Gjedrem, Governor of Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), to panel discussion on “Problems of Plenty? Challenges and Opportunities from the Accumulation of Large Exchange Reserves and Windfall Revenue”, arranged as part of the seminar program of the 2006 Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, Singapore, 18 September 2006. Please note that the text below may differ slightly from the actual presentation. *      *      * 1. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the challenges that arise when managing financial wealth in a public sector environment. Norges Bank now has eight to ten years of experience of this task, and I shall try to describe in brief the strategies adopted by Norges Bank, and what we believe we have learned.  2. We have a large amount of money under management. Our foreign reserves are probably larger than needed for financial stability and monetary policy operations. But the most important fund is the Government Pension Fund, formerly the Petroleum Fund. We have been responsible for managing that Fund since its inception in 1996, and it has been a major task for us since 1998.  3. The value of the petroleum resources in the North Sea is currently estimated at about USD 700 billion. The government receives the bulk of the revenues generated from petroleum extraction as sales revenues and taxes. The government channels these revenues into the Pension Fund as financial assets.  Annual spending from the Fund is subject to a spending rule, whereby the government commits to limit spending. Over time spending should not exceed the estimated expected real return on the Fund’s investments, set at 4 per cent per year. This implies that the Fund is expected to become a permanent savings account.  4. At the outset, there was already an investment management operation in the Bank, for the foreign reserves. But when it became clear in 1997 that the Pension Fund would be growing fast, we decided to set up a separate management unit, now called Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). Our challenge was to build a business organisation within a traditional civil service culture.  The new unit recruited investment professionals from outside the Bank as well as people from the existing reserve management operations. NBIM was explicitly defined as a business unit, which should be different from the rest of the central bank in many respects.  To avoid any suspicion that NBIM would benefit from proprietary central bank information, the new unit was placed completely outside the decision-making processes in the monetary policy and financial stability area, with no access to confidential information.  The fact that the Pension Fund does not invest in Norwegian markets is also important to avoid conflicts of interest: There is no direct link to our monetary policy operations.  5. The purposes of the Pension Fund and the foreign reserves are similar; they are both essentially national savings funds, except for that part of the reserves that we may need for policy purposes. The current asset allocation is thus effectively the same for both funds. At present they have 40 per cent in equities and 60 per cent in fixed income. The investments are widely diversified across international markets.  The investment strategy has so far aimed at low return volatility, perhaps to a larger extent than is reasonable for a fund that is meant to be permanent. The strategy is currently under review by the Ministry of Finance, and there may be changes under way.  6. The Ministry of Finance acts as owner of the Pension Fund, on behalf of the government. The management of the Pension Fund is delegated to Norges Bank. The key feature of the model is the BIS Review 86/2006 1 
division of responsibilities between the two institutions. The Ministry takes the high-level decisions and defines a clear mandate for Norges Bank. In accordance with that mandate Norges Bank makes all investment decisions without interference from the Ministry.  The benchmark portfolio for the Fund is defined by the Ministry. The benchmark determines most of the asset allocation in the actual portfolio, but the Ministry also leaves some leeway for the manager. NBIM shall deviate from the benchmark in order to obtain a higher return.  Active management has become a very important part of our investment operations. We believe that the search for excess return has had a strong disciplinary effect on the organisation with a view to controlling both market and operational risk, and to ensure that all inside and outside suppliers do exactly what they are paid to do.  7. We have tried to build an organisation where the focus is on investment returns. In order to keep that focus we have tried to implement three basic principles:  • Accountability for decisions is clearly defined  • There is transparency, nothing can be hidden away  • The professional standards required for employees are very high 8. For investment decisions these principles mean that every decision is made by one individual and that the remuneration paid to him or her depends on the profitability of the decisions. We have defined a large number of independent profit centers, each with a clearly defined mandate. A compliance function checks that no one operates outside the mandate.  For external managers we apply the same principle: Hiring an external manager is an investment decision, and someone inside NBIM is held responsible for it.  9. The salary system is different from the rest of the central bank. The main objectives are to focus attention on performance, and to give distinct signals to people who do not perform according to expectations.  Salaries have two components, a basic salary and a performance-based component. The latter is a very important part of the total salary, and implies that differences between the salaries of poor and outstanding performers are large. The level of salaries is benchmarked to private sector competitors in the local market where we operate.  The criteria used are designed to be transparent with little room for subjective judgement. Measured excess return contribution is a very important component.  10. I believe that our experience so far has been positive. Since the Fund’s first full year in 1997, the annual return in international currencies has been more than 6 per cent in nominal terms and 4.1 per cent in real terms.  Since NBIM was set up in 1998, we have recorded the performance in 34 quarters. In 9 quarters the return to the Fund has been lower than the benchmark, but in 25 out of the 34 there has been a positive excess return. On average, NBIM has earned exactly half a percentage point higher return per year than the benchmark portfolio. In nominal terms, that adds up to somewhere between USD 4 and 5 billion in extra earnings since 1998.  11. In this introduction I have touched on what I believe are important factors behind the performance of NBIM. It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of investment management operations is to make money, so we need to have a business organisation. The responsibilities of each individual must be clearly defined, and his or her remuneration must depend on performance. The incentives must be set up in a way that leads each individual to chase the correct targets, and in a way that rewards superior performance.  This is not a description of a traditional central bank culture, so the investment management unit may need to be built outside the existing structures. At the same time the existing structures may benefit 2 BIS Review 86/2006 
from having a business unit within the central bank. There are lessons to be learned about efficiency in operations, and that has also proved useful for the civil service part of Norges Bank.       BIS Review 86/2006 3

Goh Chok Tong: Sharing some perspectives on growth  Speech Mr Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the Group of Thirty(G-30) International Banking Seminar and Lunch, Singapore, 18 September 2006. *      *      * The good, the bad and the ugly Let me first bid you a warm welcome to Singapore. I was recently invited by the World Bank to be a member of the Growth Commission chaired by Professor Michael Spence. So today's topic "Sharing Some Perspectives on Growth" fits me like a glove. In offering my perspectives, I shall draw heavily on the experience of Singapore.  Forty years ago, soon after I started work in the Economic Planning Unit of the Finance Ministry, I was sent to do a post-graduate course in Development Economics at Williams College in the US. The course was designed for young officials from developing countries. There were 20 of us from 16 countries spanning four continents - Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. The countries included the Philippines, Pakistan, India, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Tanzania, Liberia, Honduras, Colombia and Mexico 1The 1960s was dubbed the "Decade of Promise". An unprecedented number of colonies had just gained independence. My fellow students and I were taught the latest development theories. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, we were full of hope. But 40 years later, history tells a different story. Only a few had our hopes fulfilled; most had their dreams dashed. Yugoslavia, Mexico and Egypt had the advantage of being close to the critical export markets in the developed world. Honduras and Tanzania had precious metal deposits, as did several of the other Latin American and African countries. Singapore had nothing, was over-populated and had high unemployment. Many economists of the day predicted that countries in Latin America and Africa would outgrow over-populated, resource-scarce Asia. The outcome, however, was totally different. Living standards have barely risen in Honduras in the last 40 years, and have declined in Tanzania. Tito's Yugoslavia no longer exists. East Pakistan fought a war with West Pakistan and separated to become Bangladesh. Civil war and internal disorder tore up countries like Liberia, Ethiopia and Uganda. Singapore which was written off by pundits as being not viable without the Malaysian hinterland not only survived but thrived. Its GDP per capita increased more than six-fold, better than any of the other 15 countries represented in my class. Why have the growth experiences of individual countries been so disparate? Some of you might have watched the movie, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", released, coincidentally, exactly 40 years ago. Set during the American Civil War, it was about three bandits who each held one clue to a hidden trove of gold coins. They did not trust each other, and wanted all the money for themselves. In the end, the "Good" bandit who put all the three clues together won. Discovering the secrets of economic growth is in a sense like looking for clues to a hidden treasure. We may each hold some clues but it is not easy to piece all of them together to achieve resilient growth. The title of the movie is also apt, I think, for categorising the growth experience of the 16 countries in my Williams class. Malaysia, which was represented in my class, enjoyed steady economic expansion of around 4% to 5% in real GDP per capita since the mid-1960s. It obviously falls into the "Good" category. I put India in the same category primarily because of its advances in the past 10 years. Others like Egypt, Pakistan and Honduras have stagnated. I would term their performance as "Bad". For all their efforts, their per capita GDP has not gone up much. But they are at least better off than others like Bolivia and Tanzania which have regressed, and are poorer now than they were in 1966. Their record is "Ugly".  Why have countries travelled such divergent "Good, Bad and Ugly" growth paths when they had all aspired for the same goal of a better life? In the past, economic theory has focused on the importance                                                       1  The Williams College 16 were: Singapore, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Philippines from Asia; Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Tanzania, Uganda from Africa; Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico from Latin America; and Yugoslavia from Europe.

of factor inputs, productivity and technology. Of late, however, academics have started to recognise how critical leadership, politics, good governance and institutions are to growth.  I believe that to trigger off and sustain economic growth, three necessary conditions are required: • First, vision and ideas;  • Second, sense of reality; and  • Third, good implementation As the first and second factors are related, I will discuss them together. Vision and ideas and sense of reality First, vision and ideas.  By this, I mean that leaders must offer a political and economic vision to excite the imagination of their people. They must offer hope and programmes to rally the people to sacrifice, struggle and work together to achieve a better future. Second, by sense of reality, I mean leaders must have their feet firmly planted on the ground even as their imagination of growth and prosperity soars. In pursuing growth, sound basic economic principles such as prudent fiscal policies, monetary discipline, and high savings must be practised. Many countries' experiences have reinforced the importance of a stable macroeconomic environment and the benefits of a market-based system. Policies on growth must be applied to local contexts in a practical way, taking into account an economy's resources and constraints. In addition, countries must be open to new ideas and be prepared to change. They must not be trapped in old paradigms but must constantly adapt to the ever-changing world. Let me illustrate this with Singapore's example. After independence, we implemented policies that promoted macroeconomic stability. We adopted prudent fiscal policies, and directed monetary policy to achieve medium-term price stability. Our MNC-led growth strategy has worked well but others are pursuing the same strategy. So for the next phase of our development, we are also building a second platform based on entrepreneurship, innovation and knowledge. New areas of focus include Research and Development, biomedical sciences and the creative industry. As the competition intensifies, we break old moulds of thinking and reinvent the way we do things. For example, we overturned our longstanding policy of disallowing casinos in Singapore. To remake Singapore into a city with buzz, we are developing Integrated Resorts, with convention facilities, world-class entertainment and casinos. And Crazy Horse, the famed Paris cabaret, is performing in strait-laced Singapore. Implementation is key The third critical aspect of growth is implementation. Right policies are no guarantee of success, if the capacity to implement is missing. Good implementation is founded on three key pillars: effective leadership, sound institutions and social cohesion. First, leaders are responsible for devising and implementing pro-growth policies. They must have the unifying vision to foster economic growth, the political will to overcome resistance and implement reforms, and the ability to mobilise people and engender social consensus. Leaders must also have character, compassion, conviction, commitment and persuasive power. Above all, they must enjoy the trust of the people. The second pillar of effective implementation is sound institutions. Effective leadership must be supported by sound institutions like the legislature, judiciary, civil service, central bank and a responsible media. Good institutions help to accumulate experience, knowledge, expertise and resources to further build capacity, thereby sustaining growth. Poor institutions, on the other hand, could be exploited by those in power for their own benefit. Corruption can easily shave off a country's potential growth rate by a few percentage points. I should emphasise that having good institutions does not presume or argue for any particular political system. What is important is that the political system must work for the country based on its own history, cultural context, national conditions and the support of its people. 2 BIS Review 86/2006 
The third pillar of effective implementation is ensuring social cohesion and forging social consensus. As policies impact on the people directly, it is important that there is social consensus and trust - between the government and society, and between different ethnic and social groups. This can be achieved only if people are given equal opportunities to learn and work, progress according to merit and rewarded based on performance and contribution. The government and the more able must also help those less able, so that no one is left behind. Sustained growth often requires trading short-term pain for long-term gain. Even the best policies can be undermined if the people are not united behind their leaders. When there is social cohesion, the different groups in a country look beyond their immediate differences and co-operate to achieve their shared vision. When all three - effective leaders, sound institutions and social consensus - are put together, we have the clues to the treasure trove of economic growth. When countries lack any of these three components, they cannot discover the treasure. In countries where politics are divisive and politicians play one group against another, investors will not commit to large scale and long-term investments. Without investor confidence, a country's capacity to grow will be severely limited.  For successful policy implementation, it often pays to start cautiously on reforms and leverage on "demonstration effects". Taking many small and gradual steps in the right direction often works better than "big bang" reforms. It allows us to review whether an idea works and make adjustments to ensure that implementation succeeds. When Deng Xiaoping opened China's doors to the outside world in 1978, he took the approach of "crossing the river by feeling the stones underfoot". He experimented with four Special Economic Zones (SEZs) (Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong, and Xiamen in Fujian) to spearhead reforms. Only when he saw success and understood clearly the challenges and impact of his liberalisation policy did he open up China further. Deng's pragmatic step-by-step approach has enabled China to grow steadily without political and social upheaval. In contrast, Gorbachev chose to reform the Soviet Union with a big bang through glasnost and perestroika at the same time. The Soviet empire collapsed with a loud bang. Back to the future: the next four decades Armed with what we know, can we spot the new growth winners in the next four decades? There are many countries in and outside Asia with the potential to be the "Good". But I will focus only on those in Asia as I am more familiar with developments here. I should add that picking winners in the growth game is a tricky business as we tend to rely on past experience and foreseeable trends. We cannot foresee unexpected, seismic events. I am emboldened, however, because I would not be around to answer for my predictions in 40 years' time! The China growth story is well-known. The Chinese jumbo jet has taken off for some time and is almost reaching cruising altitude. The pilot and his crew are in full control, coping with pockets of turbulence and ensuring a smooth flight. In East Asia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand are expected to continue to do well. Besides them, I think three other countries deserve attention because their leaders have a pragmatic vision for the country, their institutions are being strengthened and there is growing social consensus on the direction of reform. They are India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. India India is a late-comer in economic reforms. The Indian jumbo jet has just taken off the runway and is starting to climb. It has not attained cruising altitude. Its destination is still far away and the plane may have to descend from time to time to refuel. But the plane, which is well built, will continue on its long-haul journey, with its flight path unchanged. There is consensus amongst leaders from the major political parties on the direction of India's economic reforms. Whichever party is in power will have to deliver the economic goods, which the Indian people deserve and demand. In June last year, India concluded its first comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore. This is a strong signal that India intends to leverage on external economies and open itself BIS Review 86/2006 3 
further. The FTA will also act as the building block for India's comprehensive economic integration with Southeast Asia through the ASEAN-India FTA. Of course, India faces some serious challenges like inadequate infrastructure and rigid labour market. India must also find ways to make the bureaucracy more pro-business, especially towards foreign companies. In addition, India's growth in the last 10 years has been driven by its IT and services industry. But India cannot grow into a major economy on services alone. It will have to expand its manufacturing sector massively. Vietnam Next, Vietnam has grown strongly over the past decade. In the 1980s, there was a paradigm shift in the leadership's thinking. Vietnam implemented economic renovation, or doi moi, and the efforts are bearing fruit. Intel is building a chip plant in Ho Chi Minh city. Singapore, Taiwanese and Korean firms are among the biggest foreign investors in the country. The new generation Vietnamese leadership will press on with reform. However, having witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the revolutions of various colours in other communist countries, they will, like their elders, be extra careful in feeling the stones as they cross the river. They look at Singapore as one such stone in their river crossing. In 2004, I proposed to then-Prime Minister Phan Van Khai for Singapore and Vietnam to connect our economies. He took sometime to think over it before responding positively. Our two countries have since signed the Connectivity Agreement, which enables Vietnam to leverage on Singapore's strengths in sectors like finance, tourism, aviation, telecommunications and human resource development. Singapore is a base for MNCs and well-connected to other parts of the world through trade, communications and transportation. By connecting our economies, Vietnam plugs itself into the global grid. Indonesia Now, Indonesia. It has the potential to take off but more work needs to be done - on policies, institutions and implementation. Indonesia had enjoyed strong growth for three decades, from the 1970s to the mid-1990s. Unfortunately, the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 grounded the Indonesian plane. But the engine is being overhauled and the plane refitted. Banks and firms have cleaned up their balance sheets. Macroeconomic indicators have improved. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has gathered a competent crew under him. The Indonesian plane is now on the runway and lining up for take-off. President Yudhoyono has implemented some difficult but much-needed reforms. He has cut fuel subsidies, and carried through the unpopular decision to raise fuel prices to keep Indonesia's budget deficit from ballooning. Acceptance of the need for continued economic reforms by the population will build investor confidence. Investors remain concerned about unclear and inconsistent regulations as well as the security situation because of the threat of terrorism. They are also unhappy with the restrictive labour laws in the country. If these areas can be improved, foreign investments will stream in. Indonesia is a huge and sprawling archipelagic country consisting of almost 18,000 islands, making it very difficult for a concerted take-off in one single planeload. So it may be a better strategy to think in terms of building a fleet of smaller jets. Each one will take off when ready. Eventually, the entire fleet will take the whole country airborne. In other words, it may be more practical to focus first on some parts of this huge country. These parts can then demonstrate to the other regions what is needed to attract investors and generate growth. They can also generate the resources to help other parts to grow. Indonesia has now decided to use the strategy of SEZs to spearhead its growth. Singapore is working with Indonesia to develop SEZs in the nearby islands of Batam, Bintan and Karimun. When the SEZs in these islands succeed, they will provide the thrust and momentum for SEZs in other parts of the country to do likewise. 4 BIS Review 86/2006 
Conclusion Let me conclude. The subject of growth and development is complex and fascinating. There is no "one-size-fits-all" magic formula. But a country must have the necessary conditions of effective political leadership, sound institutions and social consensus on reforms, and the sharing of fruits. A country must also have the capacity to adapt as the world changes; otherwise, it will soon fall behind.  I hope that your stay in Singapore over the next few days will be fruitful, enjoyable and memorable. Thank you for visiting us. BIS Review 86/2006 5 
Glenn Stevens: Capital flows and monetary policy Remarks by Mr Glenn Stevens, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to “Investor Insights: ANZ Asia Pacific 2006” Seminar, Singapore, 17 September 2006.  I thank Guy Debelle and Michael Plumb for their considerable contributions to the historical part of this paper. *      *      * The organisers of today’s seminar have suggested the topic of Capital Flows and Monetary Policy. It seems an appropriate one in an east Asian setting. It is common to hear of the difficulties created for the conduct of domestic macroeconomic policies by capital mobility. The fact that capital flows these days are so large, and so rapid, tends to add to the perception of policy complexity. This has only grown in the wake of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, though capital flows had caused serious problems for countries in Latin America and Europe on numerous occasions long before the Asian crisis occurred. Various countries in Asia are still wary of international capital flows, and even after accumulating very high levels of foreign reserves, many seem to worry more about the possibility of sudden outflow – as opposed to the very real problems associated with large inflows. Australia too has struggled on occasion with capital flows and their complicating role for the conduct of monetary policy. But Australia’s biggest problems for the conduct of monetary policy came in the days when capital flows were more restricted than they are now, but financial prices were regulated. In those days – and I refer here to the period before the decisions in the early 1980s to allow markets to set the exchange rate and yields on government debt – the problem was basically one of monetary control: policy-makers could not accurately control the amount of settlement funds available to the banking system because domestic policy actions to control these funds were often over-run by foreign operations we had to undertake to clear the foreign exchange market at the nominated exchange rate. That fundamentally impaired the Reserve Bank’s capacity to influence broader monetary conditions: we were not actually in control of the stance of monetary policy. Those days are now long gone. The market for foreign exchange clears entirely in the private sector (unless we make a choice to intervene). The Government’s financial operations are funded at market-determined interest rates, relieving the central bank of any obligation to support a particular price in the market. The result is that the Reserve Bank is able to control the total quantity of settlement funds in the system, which allows us to set, for all practical purposes, the overnight rate of interest. That does not mean that capital flows are no longer a concern, but it does change the location, and in my view the size, of the problem they present. A deeper financial system can also absorb much larger flows with less disruption. More generally, after more than 20 years of experience, the economy and financial system have shown that they can adjust to even quite large changes in the exchange rate without undue disruption. This has involved a reasonable amount of learning by doing on the part of financial markets, businesses and policymakers – and, on occasion, the learning curve was fairly steep. But there is no doubt that the present world is preferable. The story of how we got to this position is an interesting one, and it is that story I would like to tell today. Let me do this by referring to two episodes. When capital flows were a problem The first is the year 1983. At the beginning of that year, Australia’s exchange rate regime was a crawling peg to a trade-weighted basket. (This regime had been in place since 1976.) The peg was determined daily by a management committee consisting of the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the heads of the main economic government departments.1 This group set the peg given an assessment of economic conditions, with both external and internal factors taken into consideration. The intermediate target for monetary policy was an M3 growth rate set by the Government.

Reserve Bank sought to achieve this through a combination of open market operations, changes in various reserve ratios and quantitative lending guidelines. Interest rates on various financial instruments were in the process of being liberalised at that time, though some important regulations (e.g. on housing loans) remained in place. But the capacity of the Reserve Bank to control the quantity of settlements funds in the banking system, and therefore to influence broader monetary and credit conditions, was weak, because of the commitment to a particular exchange rate, even one that varied every day. An attempt to tighten conditions by withdrawing cash from the market, for example, was likely to be thwarted by the simple expedient of the private sector borrowing offshore and converting the proceeds into Australian dollars at the price nominated by the central bank. This would reverse the initial withdrawal of cash. Conversely, when private capital decided to move out, the authorities struggled to keep the system supplied with adequate liquidity. In the lead-up to the March 1983 federal election, markets were anxious about the prospect of a change of government. In the week prior to the election, capital outflow amounted to about 3 per cent of the total money stock, or about 1½ per cent of Australia’s annual GDP. This occurred in spite of capital controls that were still in place, because the distinction between current and capital transactions was blurring and market participants were becoming more adept at circumventing the controls. Exporters were by then skilled at delaying receipts when a devaluation was anticipated, while importers accelerated their payments, as did those servicing foreign currency debt. These swings caused operational difficulties in maintaining suitable conditions in the money market. As for achieving the target for M3 growth, I can well recall, as one involved in forecasting growth of the ‘money supply’ in those days, the impossibility of forecasting the size and the persistence of the capital flows, which were one of the major drivers of the growth in the community’s monetary assets. The newly elected Labor Government responded to the crisis by devaluing the Australian dollar by 10 per cent against the TWI. This was successful in reversing the flow of funds and generating capital inflow, as exporters, for example, brought onshore their pent-up receipts. But the problems were far from solved. Later in 1983, Australia’s external position was improving, due to a post-drought recovery in the rural sector, rising commodity prices and higher demand for mineral exports. The volume of capital inflow gradually mounted, further encouraged by Australia’s positive interest differential with the major countries. This again caused problems for monetary policy as the Reserve Bank had difficulty withdrawing the resulting increase in cash in the banking system. The plan that was devised to counter these problems was one of a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate (achieved through adjustment of the daily fix), lower short-term interest rates but increased sales of government securities to fund the fiscal deficit, which was likely to see longer-term yields increase. That is, it was thought that currency speculators would be deterred by the very low short-term rates, notwithstanding the higher yields on offer at the longer end. This would help achieve the M3 target by reducing the liquidity resulting from capital inflow. The exchange rate management committee also sought to add a random element to the daily movements in the exchange rate, around the general trend appreciation, to reduce the predictability in the movements in the exchange rate and thwart the speculation. As capital inflow continued to mount during November, the Reserve Bank actually devalued the Australian dollar against the TWI.2  Attempts to frustrate the speculators were unsuccessful. Inflows continued. Finally, the exchange rate was floated on 12 December 1983 and most of the remaining capital controls were removed simultaneously. Australia was one of the few countries to have taken a decision to float when the currency was under upward pressure, because the capital inflow just could not be adequately absorbed. The decision has rightly been regarded as one of the most important ever taken by an Australian Government in the field of economic policy, for a number of reasons. Most important from the perspective of monetary policy, the system for control over the amount of settlement funds in the system became fully effective for the first time. If the Reserve Bank wanted to tighten financial conditions, by taking funds out of the system, the private sector could no longer immediately offset that by getting those funds back by selling foreign exchange to the Reserve Bank: we were no longer obliged to buy or sell foreign exchange at a given price.                                                       2  G. Debelle and M. Plumb (2006) ‘The evolution of exchange rate policy and capital controls in Australia’, Asian Economic Papers (forthcoming). 2 BIS Review 86/2006 
In summary, the operation of monetary policy in the pre-float period was significantly constrained by external considerations, and was hampered by capital flows. While we had a quantitative target for monetary growth, we had no way of exerting the required control in order to achieve that outcome. Eventually, this system was overtaken by events and we had to change it. Over a number of years, we evolved towards a floating exchange rate with a medium-term inflation target. Let me now turn to the more recent episode of Australia’s experience during the Asian crisis, to illustrate how that arrangement worked. When capital flows were not quite so much of a problem At the onset of the Asian crisis in mid 1997, the Australian economy was growing at around trend rates, with domestic demand beginning to accelerate, and underlying inflation below 2 per cent. Given the inflation performance, monetary policy had been eased over the previous year as required by our 2–3 per cent inflation target. Thus, the shock hit the Australian economy at a time when it was in reasonable shape with the stance of monetary policy already relatively expansionary.  Exports to east Asia accounted for around one-third of Australia’s exports at the time, so the decline in output in the east-Asian region represented a significant negative demand shock to the Australian economy. Australia’s terms of trade also fell as commodity prices declined, further exacerbating the loss of income. Reflecting this and the expected negative effect on the Australian economy, there was less demand for Australian assets (that is, ex ante, capital wanted to flow out). Twenty-five years earlier, such a situation would have resulted in a large loss of foreign exchange reserves, but under a floating exchange rate the adjustment was mostly borne by the exchange rate, with the Australian dollar depreciating by around 20 per cent. On some previous occasions, such a large depreciation of the exchange rate had led to a rise in inflation expectations and a pick-up in inflation due to higher import prices, so requiring an increase in interest rates to contain and eventually reverse the inflation impulse. In contemplating whether that policy response was appropriate on this occasion, we came to the view that, even though in the short term inflation was forecast to rise above 3 per cent for a time, as the depreciation was passed through to consumer prices, performance would most likely be consistent with the target thereafter. The forecast rise in inflation was not expected to be persistent, partly because the contractionary impulse from the decline in export demand would dampen growth. But, in addition, the credibility of the inflation target was by then quite well established, and this could be expected to help keep inflation expectations in check. The flexibility of the monetary policy framework allowed the validity of this assessment to be reassessed as time passed. In the event, inflation rose by less than was forecast, in part because of a decline in the pass-through of the exchange rate depreciation, as well as a greater-than-expected disinflationary impulse from the Asian region, which put downward pressure on foreign-currency import prices. As a result, by the end of 1998, not only had we not lifted interest rates, we actually reduced them slightly. So the flexible inflation target served as a useful framework within which to manage the effects of the Asian crisis and the policy response to the capital flow. We also used, on occasion, intervention in the foreign exchange market to counter the downward pressure on the exchange rate, but only after allowing it to move a considerable distance. The important aspect of this whole episode for the issue at hand is that allowing the exchange rate to move provided a part of the mechanism that helped the economy adapt to the Asian crisis and the changes in capital flows that it brought about. This reduced any disruption to the domestic economy and, most importantly, did not compromise the setting of monetary policy. It has often been remarked that the decline in the exchange rate was expansionary for the traded sector and that this helped the economy through that period. That is true, but in my view the much more important point is that capital flows and exchange rate changes did not compromise the conduct of monetary policy, which remained relatively expansionary, consistent with the needs of the economy at the time. Had we been in the world of fixed exchange rates, we would not have been able to set policy in that way. Broader macroeconomic considerations The change to the exchange rate regime, with its accompanying improvements to monetary control, would be expected to have an effect on the volatilities of key financial prices. In particular, it would be BIS Review 86/2006 3 
likely that, all other things equal, domestic interest rates would be less volatile and the exchange rate more volatile. Shocks in the form of swings in capital flows would show up more in the exchange rate and less in the level of domestic interest rates. Of course, all other things were not equal in this period. There has been a well-documented decline in macroeconomic volatility in a number of countries over the same period, the so-called Great Moderation.3 Nonetheless, as shown in Graph 1, after the floating of the exchange rate, interest rates have been considerably less volatile, and it is highly likely, at least in the case of Australia, that the change in the exchange rate regime, along with other reforms and the establishment of consistent medium-term frameworks for monetary and fiscal policy,4 made some contribution to the decline in macroeconomic volatility.  There has been an increase in the measured volatility of the exchange rate, though perhaps not by as much as might have been expected. Prior to the float, changes in the exchange rate were infrequent but very large, as the authorities made periodic adjustments to the fixed parity in response to macroeconomic and financial developments, including some induced by capital flows as I described above. In the post-float period, the increased volatility generally reflects frequent small changes in the exchange rate, in this case determined by the market. And for significant periods in the floating era, such as the mid 1990s and the past two or three years as well, exchange rate volatility has been not very different from what it was towards the end of the managed exchange rate era in the early 1980s.

  Short-term variability of the exchange rate is not necessarily costless, of course. Some people might argue that it creates a degree of uncertainty for exporters and importers, and those allocating capital. But the share of Australia’s real economy engaged in international trade, and the extent to which Australians’ financial assets are traded internationally, have grown over the same period. No doubt this was mostly a result of the general opening up of the economy to the international system, but it is difficult to support the claim that exchange rate variability has seriously impeded these developments. On the contrary, I think that the most serious potential problem for the internationally exposed sectors is not short-term exchange rate variability, but medium-term misalignment in the exchange rate. Allowing market forces to move the exchange rate makes such an outcome much less likely. Better monetary control afforded by the flexible exchange rate, on the other hand, has been an unalloyed benefit to all sectors of the economy, traded and non-traded. Lest this sound as though we never have a care in the world about the exchange rate moving, however, it is important to add one caveat to this story. It is this: a strong monetary policy framework is essential. Indeed, there were plenty of times when the movement in the exchange rate, especially downward ones, made the Reserve Bank quite uncomfortable. Looking back, these were mostly periods when the policy framework was not as well developed, or as credible, as it is today. On occasion, it seemed that the exchange rate was moving because of a change in confidence about the conduct of economic policies, including monetary policy, in Australia. This was more a feature of the 1980s, when the medium-term inflation targeting framework was not yet in place, though some episodes in the early 1990s were also troublesome as the inflation target really did not acquire strong credibility until about 1995. In some such episodes, monetary policy did respond to changes in the exchange rate by altering interest rates. But by the advent of the Asian crisis, when the exchange rate declined a lot, both we and the financial markets had developed sufficient confidence in our monetary policy framework that we were able to allow the exchange rate to do its job. The conduct of policy through that period is generally regarded as successful. Conclusion Capital mobility can complicate the conduct of monetary policy. In Australia, we have found that the complications which arise under a floating exchange rate – while often not trivial – are not of the same order of magnitude as the monetary control problems we had when capital was less mobile but financial prices were heavily regulated. In the system we have had for some years now, the inflation BIS Review 86/2006 5 
target, rather than the exchange rate, is our anchor for policy. When capital flows suddenly change, the exchange rate is free to move to absorb at least part of the shock, and we are able to decide how much of the shock should show up as changed financial conditions in Australia. This seems to be a pretty durable arrangement. Of course, it took some time to get to this position. I recognise that many other countries in the region are in a different position. Many are more open, so with perhaps less scope to allow large exchange rate moves without significant first-round inflationary or deflationary effects. Others are still working to develop stronger domestic monetary policy frameworks. Hence, these countries probably tend to worry more about the flightiness of international capital flows than do we. Nonetheless, it does seem to me that Australia’s experience offers reasonable grounds for thinking that, over time, these problems can be contained sufficiently so that we can enjoy the benefits of openness to capital flows without too much cost.  6 BIS Review 86/2006 
Timothy F Geithner: Hedge funds and derivatives and their implications for the financial system Remarks by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at the Distinguished Lecture 2006, sponsored by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Hong Kong Association of Banks, Hong Kong, 14 September 2006. *      *      * I want to thank Joseph Yam for inviting me to Hong Kong for this occasion.  We are approaching the 10-year anniversary of the financial crises of 1997-99. Those crises were remarkable both in the scope of countries and markets they affected, and for their speed and severity. The circumstances leading up to the crises varied across countries and regions, as did the magnitude of the resulting damage to the real economy. But each of these events had one dynamic in common - the confluence of a sharp increase in risk perception, and the subsequent actions taken by financial institutions and investors to limit their exposure to future losses. As asset prices declined and volatility increased in response to increased concern about risk, firms moved to call margin, to reduce positions and to hedge against further losses. These individual actions had the aggregate effect of inducing even larger price declines and further heightening perceptions of risk, ultimately propagating and amplifying the effects of the initial shock.  The dynamic I just described was not unique to the crises of the late 1990s, nor was the damage to overall economic activity they left in their wakes. Systemic financial events with spillovers to the real economy have been a persistent feature of the economic environment, and both financial market participants and policymakers have grappled with the challenge of how to reduce their incidence and to minimize their severity, longevity and impact on the broader economy.  There is a lot we do not understand about these challenges, but we know more today than we once did. In the case of the crises of the late 1990s, despite the broad-based nature of the financial market turmoil, in countries where capital cushions in the financial sector were strong relative to risk, where there was a greater diversity of institutions in the financial system to absorb the losses, and where monetary authorities were in a position to provide liquidity to restore confidence, the financial and macroeconomic impact of the crises was relatively modest. Where those conditions did not exist, the damage was acute. The U.S. economy appears to have become more resilient to financial shocks. Over the past two decades, the U.S. economy has experienced several episodes of significant financial market strain. These episodes were associated with spikes in risk perception and significant market volatility within financial markets, but none proved exceptionally damaging in terms of the overall macroeconomic impact. The mild impact of these episodes on the real economy contrasts with financial events such as the “credit crunch” that exacerbated the 1990-91 recession. That episode was characterized by a widespread reduction in the provision of credit by banks in response to loan losses and the need to raise capital.  The resiliency we have observed over the past decade or so is not just good luck. It is the consequence of efforts by regulatory, supervisory and private financial institutions to address previous sources of systemic instability. Risk management has improved significantly, and the major firms have made substantial progress toward more sophisticated measurement and control of concentration to specific risk factors. What seems to have been most critical in preventing financial market turmoil from translating into a significant reduction in credit provision by banks and other financial institutions were the steps taken by regulatory authorities and financial institutions alike to strengthen capital in the core of the financial system, and to measure and manage risk.  These efforts have most notably manifested themselves in increased levels of risk-adjusted capital in the core of the system relative to what prevailed in the early 1990s. In the United States, for example, tier-one risk-based capital ratios have stabilized near 8.5 percent, considerably higher than the estimated levels around 6.5 percent for the early 1990s. This is based on a relatively crude measure of risk, but the direction of the improvement is right and the magnitude of the change is significant.  Relative to the conditions that prevailed in the early 1990s, the higher levels of capital in the core now provide a larger buffer against shocks and enhance the ability of the banking industry to act as a critical stabilizer in times of stress by providing liquidity to the corporate sector. When financial markets BIS Review 85/2006 1 
dry up, firms turn to banks and their unused loan commitments and lines of credit. Banks are in a position to fund this liquidity because transaction deposits tend to flow into the banking sector. In times of crisis, it appears that U.S. investors now run to banks, not away from them. In view of the critical role that efficient credit provision plays in economic growth and development, the benefits to the global economy of getting the underpinnings of a stable, efficient financial system in place are substantial. At the same time, we also know that these important markets are susceptible to certain “market failures,” such as information asymmetries, incentive conflicts, moral hazard and agency problems. By at times distorting incentives to manage risk, these market imperfections can alter credit decisions and lead to a higher overall level of risk-taking than may be optimal for the economy as a whole. This provides the classic rationale for supervision and regulation. Supervision and regulation have the potential to help mitigate these sources of market failure. The recognition of a market failure does not mean, of course, that policymakers have the capacity to design solutions that can effectively mitigate those failures without raising others problems. The fundamental challenge for policy is how to achieve the appropriate balance between efficiency and financial resilience. With too much government intervention, innovation is constrained and the system is stifled. With too little, the probability of systemic crisis may rise to levels that are unacceptably high. We judge the appropriate balance not against the standard of whether it reduces to zero the probability of a major financial crisis, the failure of a large individual financial institution or a major reduction in asset prices. That is not an appropriate objective of policy. Some vulnerability to crisis is a necessary and unavoidable feature of a dynamic and efficient financial system where asset prices need to be able to adjust to changes in fundamentals. The consequences of trying to induce regulated financial institutions to self-insure against all conceivable potential risks would do substantial damage to the level and efficiency of economic activity and cause the same risks to migrate to other institutions.  This leaves policymakers with a set of normative questions, the answers to which must be based on knowledge about how markets work, as well as a substantial degree of judgment about what policy actions are likely to be both appropriate and effective. What level of exposure to very low probability, extreme adverse events should we be comfortable living with? What fraction of that residual exposure to the potential range of adverse events can and should the official sector try to protect the system against?  The apparent success that market participants and supervisors have had so far in confronting these issues does not imply that the potential for systemic risk in financial markets no longer deserves the attention of central banks and supervisors. Although improvements in capital adequacy and risk-management tools seem to have been a key part of the increased resiliency we’ve seen in recent years, we can’t assume that the standards and risk-management practices consistent with stability in the recent past are the ones that will perform well in the future. This is partly because it is impossible to know for sure how the favorable macroeconomic conditions and the financial sector stability interacted and reinforced each other. That is, would financial sector outcomes be as favorable in a weaker macro environment?  But probably more important is the fact that even as we have pushed forward on regulatory, supervisory and risk-management efforts, financial markets, instruments and institutions have continued to evolve as well. Among the most notable of these changes has been the rapid growth and innovation in derivatives and the greater relative importance of private leveraged financial institutions, such as hedge funds.  The changes in credit markets that have accompanied the latest wave of innovation in derivatives and the large role played by leveraged financial institutions in those markets may exacerbate some of the traditional sources of challenges in financial markets. And they present new challenges for the framework of incentives and constraints that central banks and supervisors set for financial institutions. On balance, we believe these changes in the financial environment are likely to come with substantial benefits in terms of overall market efficiency. In the remainder of my remarks today, I will highlight some of these benefits, but will also consider some of the challenges they present for central banks and governments in determining where on the spectrum of efficiency and vulnerability to crisis the financial system should operate, and in crafting the policies consistent with achieving that objective.  2 BIS Review 85/2006 
Changes in financial markets since the late 1990s In the United States and the other major markets, the policies designed to mitigate the risk of financial crises rely primarily on a capital-based system of supervision of the major financial institutions, reinforced by measures to improve market discipline. These policies have evolved to reflect both the fundamentally important role credit markets play in the economy, as well as the reality that these complex markets are susceptible to a range of potential market failures.  In thinking about the potential supervisory and regulatory challenges presented by the broad evolution of the financial system over the past decade, it makes sense to first consider how some of these changes may have enhanced market functioning by mitigating at least some of the imperfections that characterize these markets. My remarks here are a mix of what we see happening in practice and how we might expect things to work in principle.  To begin with, financial institutions within the regulated core of the financial sector have become larger, and the industry considerably more concentrated. The 10 largest bank holding companies now hold roughly half of banking assets, compared to less than a third in 1990. These institutions now operate with greater geographic scope and offer a broader range of financial products, but overall volatility of earnings has not changed much relative to capital.  Hedge funds, private equity funds and other leveraged financial institutions control increasingly large shares of aggregate financial capital and play very active roles in many asset markets and in credit markets. Although assets under management in hedge funds still represent a relatively small share of total financial assets, their relative share has increased significantly and their ability to take on substantial leverage magnifies their potential impact on financial market conditions. These private leveraged funds have become an important source of protection to regulated institutions by being large sellers of credit insurance in the rapidly growing market for credit default swaps. In terms of enhancing overall market efficiency, the growth of these private leveraged institutions can be expected to provide benefits in terms of improved liquidity, price discovery via arbitrage, diversity of opinion and diversification opportunities for investors. The increase in the share of assets managed by private pools of capital devoted to arbitrage activity should improve the overall functioning of markets. In most circumstances, increased trading and participation contributes to market liquidity and makes markets less volatile. The ultimate benefit should be lower risks for all market participants. This in turn should reduce the risk premia associated with holding financial assets, and ultimately reduce the cost of capital. The rapid growth in the relative importance of these leveraged financial institutions has been accompanied by a number of structural changes as well. The total number of funds has grown dramatically. There are more very large hedge funds and private equity firms. Greater institutionalization, and the maturity of risk management and operational infrastructure in the largest of these private funds, has likely reduced operational risk. To the extent these changes have increased the diversity of firms and strategies in this part of the financial system, and this is hard to measure with any confidence, this heterogeneity should provide diversification opportunities, foster more efficient price discovery and could help improve stability.  These changes in market participants have occurred in conjunction with a dramatic acceleration in number and type of derivative instruments. These developments have likely had the important impact of allowing for a more efficient distribution and more effective management of risk.  All of these changes should move the market in the direction of fostering the efficient allocation of credit and capital formation, and thus enhancing the economy’s real growth potential.  The available evidence is consistent with the view that the changes in the core of supervised institutions, growth of the leveraged sector and rapid financial innovation have strengthened the efficiency and resiliency of the overall financial system. As I mentioned at the start, a broad range of recent financial shocks do not seem to have adversely impacted the real economy. The international financial crisis that began in 1997 did not spillover to the nonfinancial sector in the United States. The equity price collapse and deterioration in credit in 2000 did not cause significant damage to the core institutions in the U.S. market. The relatively limited damage caused by operations failures of the 9/11 attacks reflected the strength of the capital position of major intermediaries, as well as the policy actions by the Federal Reserve to provide liquidity to the markets.  More recently, the series of smaller financial shocks experienced since 2001, including the corporate bond defaults after 2001, the corporate accounting scandals in 2002, credit downgrades in the U.S. BIS Review 85/2006 3 
automobile industry in 2005, the failure of Refco, the sharp declines in mid-2006 in equity, commodity and emerging markets debt prices caused little contagion to other markets and limited strain on financial institutions. Challenges The favorable balance between efficiency and resilience in the financial system we have observed recently does not of course guarantee we will achieve as favorable a balance in the future. The prospects for future stability will depend in part on how effective supervisors are in adapting policies in response to the ongoing evolution in markets.  Financial institutions face strong incentives to monitor and limit their risk profile and the risk-taking of their leveraged counterparties to some efficient level where benefits balance costs at the margin. This is good for the firm and also good from society’s perspective. Private pools of capital have the capacity to use extensive leverage to amplify returns. This leverage can be acquired in a variety of ways: through repurchase agreements and reverse repos, through secured financing and securities lending and through derivatives and structured financial products.  The ability of funds to take on risk and leverage is constrained by two external sources of discipline - the returns required by their investors, and the terms on which their dealers/financers are willing to extend credit. In other words, the fund is constrained by the willingness of outsiders, collectively, to take exposure to the fund. The willingness of banks and investment banks to take on exposure to hedge funds is in turn influenced by the capital and supervisory framework that applies to those institutions and the discipline imposed on them by the market. The effectiveness of market discipline in constraining the risk-taking behavior of financial firms, however, may be compromised by the presence of market failures of the type mentioned above. While this issue is at the heart of risk management challenges for the provision of credit more broadly, the rise in the relative size of the private leveraged fund sector and the rise in the importance of new derivative financial instruments may complicate the design of policies and risk-management practices to counteract these traditional frictions. Virtually all types of credit markets suffer from informational problems - consider the challenge faced by a bank in assessing the risk associated with lending to a small unrated company. But the complexity of new financial products, the rapidity with which positions can change, and the lack of a long time series of historical relationships seems likely to enhance these problems for leveraged institutions operating in new markets such as credit derivatives.  Funds typically deal with several different banks and investments banks. The desire to maintain the confidentiality of their trading strategies has traditionally led firms to be quite opaque to outsiders and reluctant to give their banks sufficiently detailed information on a real time basis about the risk profile of the overall fund. Without that information, individual dealers or banks have a difficult time evaluating the probability of default of a leveraged counterparty and the potential covariance with other positions of the firm.  Individual firms may also see only a piece of the hedge fund’s positions, and if their direct exposure to the individual fund is small, may perceive less need to worry about the overall risk profile of the fund. Public disclosure requirements designed to compensate for this information problem do not exist. Even if information on the overall size of the fund’s positions were available periodically, it would be difficult to accurately ascertain its risk profile. This gives individual firms an incentive to free-ride on the due diligence or monitoring by others, which may render resultant collective discipline inadequate. The foundations of modern risk measurement rest on a framework that uses past returns to measure or estimate the distribution of future returns. The stability of the recent past, even if much of it proves durable, probably understates potential risk. The parameters used to estimate value at risk can produce very large differences in predicted exposure, especially at extreme confidence intervals. Estimating the potential interactions among these exposures in conditions of stress is even harder, due to the uncertainty about the behavior of investors and other market participants and because of the potential effects of financial distress on overall economic activity.  The relatively short history of returns for new products, the complexity of measuring exposure in many new instruments and limitations on transparency also create the potential for classic “agency” problems - internal conflicts of interest that can lead to problematic outcomes. In exposures where the 4 BIS Review 85/2006 
measurement of potential loss is more uncertain, more subjective, and less amenable to independent evaluation, for example, reasonable people can come to very different judgments about the potential risk in a particular position. Normal competitive pressures can push valuation methods away from the conservative extreme and generate larger exposures to risk. As a result, individual firms and the overall market are more exposed to risk in a stress scenario than would be desirable. Another set of challenges comes with the broader damage to markets that can accompany the failure of a major financial institution. Firms have strong incentives to avoid large financial losses and to reduce the risk of failure, of course, but they do not have the incentive to internalize the potential external consequences of their distress on the financial system, and it is unrealistic for market participants to incorporate these risks into market prices. This “public good” dimension of financial stability means that while the whole economy benefits from a more stable financial system, each individual institution would prefer that others incur the costs associated with its provision. As a result, firms may collectively underinsure against the risk of failure and underinvest in the infrastructure and policies that promote financial stability.  And finally, policies designed to reduce the risk of failure in financial markets create moral hazard, dulling the incentive individual firms face to self-insure against potential loss. We apply a set of capital requirements and supervisory constraints to offset the distortion created by the safety net, but these may not fully compensate for the impact on behavior of the broader range of financial intermediaries of the perception that the authorities will act to protect the financial system from systemic risk.  While these constraints and challenges may weaken the effectiveness of counterparty discipline, they are not fatal constraints. If individual dealers to a very large hedge fund each operate with adequate knowledge of the risk profile of the fund, if they each make conservative judgments about their potential direct exposure to the fund in a stress scenario, if they limit the overall exposure of the firm as a whole to the broader market distress that might accompany that failure of a major hedge fund, if they compensate for the uncertainty in making these judgments by charging appropriate risk premia or building in a greater cushion against adversity, and if the supervisory constraints on the core institutions adequately offset the moral hazard that comes with that relationship, then the financial system as a whole will be less vulnerable to distress in the hedge fund sector. These are exacting conditions, but they are not unachievable. And we all have an interest in encouraging progress toward that objective.  Implications for policy and risk management What are the implications of these challenges for central banks and supervisors? The changes in the financial system we’ve seen over the past decade don’t change the principal objectives of policy - to ensure that the core financial institutions maintain an adequate cushion of capital in relation to risk, and to build greater resilience into the infrastructure that supports the financial markets. We have very limited ability to predict the sources of stress to the financial system, but if the cushions at the core of the system are robust, the risk of a systemic crisis will be diminished, and central banks will have greater ability to mitigate the risk of broader damage to the economy. The pace and extent of the changes in financial markets requires supervisors to work harder to understand the consequences of changing market practice for the incentives and constraints we impose on financial institutions. Let me give two examples of evolving market practices that may help alleviate one concern only to exacerbate another. Collateral plays an increasingly important role in counterparty credit risk management, particularly for highly leveraged counterparties. The increased importance of variation margining plays a critical role in counterparty credit risk management. These changes help limit the exposure of the core financial institution to losses among their leveraged counterparties, but they also act to exacerbate volatility, with asset price declines forcing further margin calls, adding for further market declines. Where initial margin is thin in relation to potential exposure, counterparties are more exposed to adverse movements in asset prices, and in a situation of stress the actions they take to reduce their exposure to further losses are likely to have a greater negative impact on market dynamics.  In market conditions where initial margin may be low relative to potential future exposure, the self-preserving behavior of leveraged funds and their counterparties may be more likely to exacerbate rather than mitigate an unexpected deterioration in asset prices and market liquidity. As financial firms demand more collateral, funds are forced to liquidate positions, adding to volatility and pushing down asset prices, leading to more margin calls and efforts by the major firms to reduce their exposure to BIS Review 85/2006 5 
future losses. In the context of the previous discussion of externalities, firms’ incentives to minimize their own exposure can amplify the initial shock and impose on others the negative externality of a broader disruption to market liquidity. The fact that this potential adverse dynamic exists does not mean it will occur. The deviation of prices from their fundamental values in times of stress is likely to create incentives for firms and investors with resources to step in and provide liquidity. In other words, the market may itself have the capacity to self-correct and prevent a disruptive loss of liquidity.  A second example is the recent trend to lengthen lock-ups, implement redemption gates that limit withdrawals, and create special side-pocket accounts for particularly illiquid investments by hedge funds. Each of these changes may serve to reduce the liquidity risk of the fund, which should be beneficial and potentially reduce the disruption from the forced liquidation of positions. They may also, however, reduce market discipline and increase the overall scale of leverage assumed by those funds. We don’t have the capacity to assess with confidence the balance of these effects on the probability of crisis and the severity of market dynamics in conditions of stress.  What should be the focus of supervisory efforts in this new context? Clearly, capital supervision and market discipline remain the key tools for limiting systemic risk. The emergence of new market participants such as leverage institutions does not change that. I am going focus on three broad policy priorities - risk management, capital and margining practices, and the financial infrastructure.  Risk management We should focus more attention on parts of the risk-management process where uncertainty is greatest and materiality of the risks that we can’t readily quantify is highest. This means more attention on the risk factors where the measurement challenges are most complex. It means more attention on assessing potential exposure in extreme events that lie outside past experience, not just those outside of the recent past.  These challenges require using a mix of different analytical tools to help illustrate the range of possible outcomes and the dimensions of uncertainty that apply to the measurement of exposure. The focus should be not on the specific estimates produced for various types of asset price movements or stress events, but the uncertainty that surrounds those estimates and the magnitude of the potential underestimation of losses. Another way to say this is that we probably need to spend as much time discussing the limits of the quantitative outputs of the risk-management process as we do on the estimates produced by the models.  Understanding and evaluating “tail events” - low probability, high severity instances of stress - is a principal, and extraordinarily difficult, aspect of risk management. These challenges have likely increased with the complexity of financial instruments, the opacity of some counterparties, the rapidity with which large positions can change, and the potential feedback effects associated with leveraged positions.  Stress testing and scenario analysis have become central to the process of risk management, and we have seen substantial progress since 1998. The efficacy of these tools should be judged in part by the extent to which they capture, on a high frequency basis, the full exposure of the firm to a sufficiently broad range of adverse conditions, the aggregate exposure to specific types of different risk factors and types of counterparties, the potential interactions among those factors, the effects of a general loss of liquidity and confidence in markets, and the constraints on the ability of the firm to move to reduce its exposure to further losses. And, of course, the credibility of the risk-management process should be judged not just by the quality of attempts to estimate stress exposure, but also by the impact of these results on the decisions about how much exposure the firm actually takes. In other words, effective stress testing must be viewed not only as a tool for monitoring the risks a firm has taken, but for actually influencing and changing behavior. Supervisors should focus on concentrations of exposure to a range of different risk factors, not just on the concern of the particular moment or the most recent sources of shocks. Just as generals are often accused of preparing to fight the last war, practice tends to chase measures of direct exposure implicated in past crises, or what seem like the plausible candidates for future crises, whether to real estate, to hedge funds, to structured financial products, to emerging markets or to a particular industry. 6 BIS Review 85/2006 
This may be necessary and desirable, but it is not the most challenging task in risk management, and we generally don’t put ourselves in the position of trying to substitute our judgment for the markets on what level of direct exposure to a particular company or industry is prudent relative to capital. The better approach is to look at what might happen to the firm’s losses in various alternative, more adverse states of the world, and then assess the direct and indirect effects of distress in different parts of the portfolio and the interactions among them. The major financial institutions, for example, typically take on very little direct current exposure to hedge funds as group. But, as you might expect, the scale of potential future exposure is more substantial. An even greater challenge is measuring the exposure of the firm not simply to the direct effects of the failure of a particular hedge fund counterparty, but to the broader distress that it might cause to other market participants or its impact on the other exposures of the firm. The management of these direct and indirect exposures needs to be an important focus of attention.  Capital and margin Supervisors have put a considerable amount of effort over the past decade into designing a successor to the Basel capital accord. The present regime does not do a good enough job of capturing the risks a major institution typically assumes today. Because it understates the amount of capital required against some risks, overstates others, and ignores still others, we should work to put in place a replacement regime as quickly as we can be confident we have a viable alternative. The prudent, conservative approach should be to move forward to a more risk sensitive framework that creates better incentives for prudent risk management, not to try to extend the life of the present accord. It is critical that these broader efforts to fix the capital regime be reinforced with more attention by supervisors to margin practice and limits around the counterparty risk-management process within the major financial institutions. The regulatory capital regime is designed to offset the effects on individual firms of lower margin. Where margin levels are low relative to potential exposure, the capital requirement is higher. Where margin is higher, the capital charge is lower. Both capital and margins have costs, and firms seek to limit these costs and choose their preferred combination. The question for policymakers is whether the mix of capital and margins produced by the market is appropriate from the perspective of the financial system as a whole. As forms of financing that enable leverage and as leveraged funds grow in importance, the overall level of margin held against positions can provide an important cushion against the type of adverse market dynamics and general run on liquidity we saw in 1998. For these reasons, in the 2005 report of the Counterparty Risk Management Policy Group, chaired by Gerry Corrigan, a diverse mix of major market participants recommended that margin levels be set at a threshold that is “sustainable over the cycle.” This reflects a view that, in general, the initial margin required of unregulated leverage counterparties should be set to provide some cushion against potential exposure.  Financial infrastructure Supervisors should continue to encourage improvements in the infrastructure that supports financial markets. When we think about infrastructure in today’s market, it’s not enough to look just at the technology and risk-management systems that support the major exchanges and the payments and settlement systems operated by central banks and private utilities. This view is reflected in the amount of recent supervisory attention that has been focused on the systems within and among private institutions that support the bilateral over-the-counter derivatives markets. Last September, 14 major financial institutions and their principal supervisors met at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to undertake a concerted program of improvements to the infrastructure that supports the OTC credit derivatives market. When that group reconvenes next week, we will review the extent of progress in reducing the backlog on unconfirmed trades and increasing the number of trade confirmed through automatic systems. We will also assess the progress toward agreement on a protocol for settlement events. And we will review new commitments to expand this effort to other OTC derivatives, including equity derivatives.  These priorities for policy and supervision have the potential to strengthen our financial system and make it more robust to real systemic events. To be effective, however, we must continue to explore ways for supervisors and regulators to cooperate more closely together. The changes in market structure and financial innovation during the past decade, along with the increased global integration of capital markets, have increased opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. Policy initiatives that focus BIS Review 85/2006 7 
only on the U.S. market or on a specific class of institutions will push the activity to other markets or other institutions, raising costs on the regulated intermediaries without reducing overall risk in the system. Balancing the imperative of a cooperative approach across markets and institutions with the need for a more agile response to the rapid pace of evolution in markets will be a continuing challenge. Conclusion The changes in the financial system since 1998 confront us with a mix of benefits and challenges. The larger size and scope of the core institutions, the greater opportunities for risk transfer and hedging provided by innovation in derivatives, the improvements in risk management, the larger role played by a much expanded number and more diverse mix of private fund managers seem likely to have improved the stability and resilience of the financial system across a broader range of circumstances. The same factors that may have reduced the probability of future systemic events, however, may amplify the damage caused by and complicate the management of very severe financial shocks. The changes that have reduced the vulnerability of the system to smaller shocks may have increased the severity of the large ones. Supervisors need to continue to focus attention on reducing the vulnerability of the market to these low probability, but extreme events, while preserving the benefits that have come with these changes in financial markets. The limitations of the conventional risk-management tools in assessing potential losses in the adverse tail of possible outcomes in today’s financial system magnify the risk that individual institutions will operate with less of a cushion than might be desirable for the market as a whole.  As the structure of markets change, we need to continue to review whether the overall framework of supervision over the core banks and investment banks provides the right balance of efficiency and resilience for the system as a whole. The capital requirements and other constraints we place on the regulated institutions have played an important role in encouraging the transfer of risk to a broader range of institutions, including the leveraged private pools of capital. As the aggregate size and importance of those funds increases, distress among those institutions can have greater effects on overall market dynamics, potentially increasing risks to the regulated core. Over time, this will force us to consider how to adapt the design and scope of the supervisory framework to achieve the protection against systemic risk that is so important to economic growth and stability.  For the present, however, our hierarchy of priorities should focus on improving supervisory incentives to make counterparty discipline more effective and to strengthen the resilience of the core institutions to more adverse economic and financial conditions.  Thank you. 8 BIS Review 85/2006 
Ardian Fullani: Economic outlook and important developments in Albania  Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at The Economist's Conference – First Business Roundtable with the Government of Albania: Identifying new business opportunities, Tirana, 14 September 2006. *      *      * Honorable Chairman, Distinguished Participants, I am very pleased to be here today to share and discuss with you our views, future macroeconomic and financial market developments and outline our policy orientation. I was looking forward to converse to this forum. It is a great opportunity that such well known institution, focus their attention toward Albania. I would like to thank The Economist Conferences and express my deepest and highest appreciation for this venture. I am confident that members of all communities, foreign and domestic, gathered here today will leave this forum with a clear image on the economic reality and business opportunities Albania has to offer. Assisted by geopolitical conditions and actual state of affairs, although small at a glance, Albanian economy presents numerous financial and economic advantages and incentives. Recently Albanian economy has reached a commendable macroeconomic equilibrium, sustained by an economic growth of 5-6 percent, low inflation levels well contained within a 2-3 percent band, and continuously shrinking budget deficits. It is my pleasure to emphasize that the Bank of Albania and its policy has been rightfully credited and earned accolades by established foreign and domestic institutions for its notable role in such accomplishments. Monetary policy has been designed and implemented in line with midterm country’s macroeconomic program: with specific focus on price and financial stability Let me now briefly summarize what I believe are the latest most important developments, and outline our economic outlook.  Economic growth After the significant electricity shortages at the end of 2005, it appears that traditional growth promoting industries like services (tourism) and construction are growing at a stable pace, contributing at a sustainable economic growth. Building upon these developments as well as other positive indicators, we expect the economy will grow at a solid rate of 5-5.5 percent. The main challenge remains ensuring sustainability of these growth rates, even higher in the long run. I believe that respective Albanian authorities have already identified the major priorities of these challenges which fully converge with Bank of Albania views. Just to remind you I would briefly summaries some of these priorities. Building new, preferably alternative, energy sources and improving the efficiency is top priority. In our view, sufficient and reliable energy supply remains a main concern to achieving economic growth. Providing a solution to this problem is a priority in the verge of increasing global demand and energy prices. Speeding up the privatization process of the remaining state assets is another important step forward. Special attention should be paid to structural reforms, particularly property rights and legal framework. In our opinion services, construction and in particular agriculture will remain driving forces of the GDP growth in the coming years.  Therefore I would strongly agree with any initiative that encourages FDI’s in these sectors through attractive laws and other measures. I believe FDI’s are very important for providing long term stability of the foreign sector. Moreover the productivity growth that usually follows FDI’s inflows will play e significant role in reducing current account deficit. Our economy needs more foreign direct investments hence Country Credit Ratings constitute a chief priority for our economy.  It is my belief that FDI’s represent a regional rather than an individual challenge for the South East Europe. Countries in the region must coordinate their efforts toward creating a regional market. Regional infrastructure projects will significantly increase attractiveness and competitiveness as well as international financial market awareness toward our region. It will improve confidence and provide necessary economic incentives to enter in the region leading to higher FDI’s inflows for each economy. BIS Review 85/2006 1 
Inflation Our economy has experienced a relatively long period of stable prices. Annual inflation figure as measured by the consumer price index, for the last 12 months is reported at 2.4 percent. Both monetary and fiscal policies have been important factors in keeping inflation low. However, recently inflation pressures have accelerated. The fast growth of credit to economy, the steep increase of oil prices, administrative increase of energy prices, as well as other risks have the potential to create inflationary pressures and pose risk to elevate inflation expectations. Bank of Albania will take all necessary actions to ensure an inflation rate of 3 per cent with a tolerance band of ± 1 percent, in the short and long run.  Interest rates During the recent years interest rates have dropped reflecting the ease of monetary policy. This has been a general trend for all financial assets either in Lek or foreign currency. On average banking system applies 9.7 percent for loans in domestic currency. The yield of 12 month Government securities dropped at a minimum of 5.74 percent in June 2006. However, following the last decision of the Bank of Albania and latest trends in global markets, a modest increase in interest rates has been observed during the last three months for both domestic and foreign financial instruments. We expect this trend to persist within the next 6-12 months.  Banking system The Albanian banking system continues to expand. It is solid, consolidated and fully capitalized. The system consists of 17 banks, of which only 3 are entirely domestically owned. Banking network has been extended continuously including remote areas. Banking products increased in number and improved in quality. Entrance in the market of important European financial groups created a better competitive environment and further enhanced efficiency. The expansion of lending portfolio and more competitive lending rates has deepened financial intermediation. Latest data show that in June 2006, the assets of the banking sector reached 60 per cent of the Albanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Rapid changes in the banking system in light of credit boom, and global market financial integration impose the need for higher standards of transparency, accountability and governance from the banking system itself. Not only with regard to Bank of Albania, but public as well. Banks should behave responsibly and must integrate the stability of the entire system into their utility function. Financial system reforms Since years the banking systems has been in a constant process of transformation. The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) marks a significant moment in this process. On behalf of the Bank of Albania I would like to thank IMF and WB, for their excellent efforts on this professional and transparent financial certification of the Albanian Financial System.  Bank of Albania remains very much focused in fulfilling the recommendations of the FSAP following the priority and institutional hierarchy.  • Bank of Albania has increased the access and investment opportunities of commercial banks in the securities market. • The draft on Banks Law is completed.  • Automated clearing house system is operational.  • The number of electronic transfers has increased significantly. There is concrete evidence that shows a continuous reduction of cash economy.  • Bank of Albania has extended its supervisory authority over all non-bank financial institutions that operate within the economic territory of the Republic of Albania. • Supervisory Board of the Bank of Albania has further increased the transparency of its decision making process. Minutes are released regularly and Bank of Albania website provides fresh info on daily activity.  2 BIS Review 85/2006 
• There is significant progress on establishing the Credit Information Bureau. We hope by the end of next year that will be fully operational. • Last but not the least I would stress out that we have already presented a detailed action plan for the remaining part of the FSAP recommendations.  Honorable participants,  Designing and implementing monetary policy has become more challenging. Globalization in particular has exposed our economy to foreign shocks. In addition policy actions of ECB and FED, exert their impact on Albanian economy mainly due to high extend of currency substitution. Rapid growth of lending activity is the most notable development among domestic factors. According to our figures over the last two years credit to economy has expanded by an equivalent of 10-12 GDP percentage points. At this rate it is expected to reach 18-20 percent of GDP at the end of current year. Is worth mentioning that approximately 30 percent of the outstanding credit represents consumer credit, moreover 75 percent of the outstanding stock is loaned in foreign exchange currency. This represents a very important development and deserves scrupulous attention. Our main concerns relate to inflationary pressures and non-performing loans that such credit expansion might generate.  In the light of these developments Bank of Albania assessed that existing stance of monetary policy was not providing enough stimulus to curb aggregate demand. Therefore in July 2006 Bank of Albania decided to shift the course of monetary policy by raising the base rate (7 days repo rate) with 25 basis points. We are happy to observe that market is reacting following our decision. However based on our short term inflation forecasts and in presence of several risks, some of which I already explained above, Bank of Albania perceives that inflation pressures for the next 12 months remain elevated. Currently we are cautiously evaluating the extend of market response and assessing whether further action is needed.  Simultaneously Bank of Albania is becoming increasingly concerned regarding the quality of loan portfolio. The accelerated pace of credit expansion, is posing challenges to both banks and to supervisory authority. The response to these challenges will aim at achieving macroeconomic stability, by means of a well capitalized banking system. With this goal in mind, the Bank of Albania, as the supervisory authority, has intensified the dialogue with the banks in order to find an adequate consensus for: setting realistic objectives of annual activity growth; containing the credit expansion and maintain good credit portfolio quality; strengthen the internal control and risk monitoring systems; and monitor carefully the capital indicators. I would like to use this floor to emphasize that Bank of Albania will be very firm to follow strictly all requirements that derive from the law and regulatory framework. On our part, we will make the necessary modifications in the supervisory and regulatory framework that target the above mentioned issues with a realistic and flexible approach. The sole purpose of this conformist approach to supervisory rules, is to provide a cushion for avoiding potential future disturbances in the financial stability.  Finally I would like to strongly emphasize for all business community, households and all other economic agents that Bank of Albania will make all efforts to ensure and further consolidate the general macroeconomic equilibrium in Albanian Economy, with specific role on financial stability.   I believe that business community comprehends this important mission. Bank of Albania intends to be vocal regarding its prospects for economic developments, so that none of its actions should come to you as a surprise. Therefore I invite you to interpret our signals fairly and smoothly integrate them into your decision making process. I would like to remind you that our medium term agreement with IMF and focused policy orientation toward EU and European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) provides additional collateral for our pledge. Thanking The Economist Conference for giving me this opportunity I am open to take questions and share comments.  BIS Review 85/2006 3 
Yves Mersch: Monetary policy and time inconsistency in an uncertain environment Speech by Mr Yves Mersch, Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg, at the NOBELUX Seminar, Luxembourg, 11 September 2006. *      *      * 1  Time inconsistency and policy 1.1  About time inconsistency On October 11, 2004 Fynn Kydland and Edward Prescott were rewarded the "Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel". One of the reasons for granting them the so-called "Nobel-prize in economics", was that they enriched the economics profession with an insight that was to change the thinking about economic policy. At first, their research was meant to merely shed some light on the execution of control theory in dynamic systems. All of a sudden, however, they ran into a problem, which although seemingly harmless, was to direct their work into a completely unexpected direction. They discovered the power of expectations in a policy planning framework. In the late 1960s, the role of expectations was investigated thoroughly and they were found to be important variables, which may determine economic outcomes. Academics like Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps strongly contributed to this line of research in the framework of monetary policy. Later Robert Lucas introduced the concept of "rational" expectations. According to this concept, individuals form their expectations rationally, using all information available to them. The information includes the functioning of the economy, the objectives of the government and all other relevant variables. This concept implies that a government (or the monetary authority) cannot systematically betray market participants by pretending to follow a certain policy and subsequently acting differently. Using this argument, Kydland and Prescott included government behaviour in their model and assumed that individuals form rational expectations. They showed that even if the government and its citizens pursue the same objectives, i.e. maximising the welfare of the population, discretionary policy is subject to a fundamental time consistency problem. The fundamental problem is that a government policy that is optimal at a certain point in time may not be optimal later on. Since individuals form rational expectations, they realize that the government has this incentive to deviate from its previously announced policy, and behave accordingly. The point is that the population’s expectations put an extra constraint on government policy and so if the government has an incentive to deviate, consistent policy will not be optimal and an optimal policy will not be time consistent. If, for example, the government chooses the policy optimal at a certain point in time, it does not take into account the expectations previously formed by the private sector. Since the private sector did take some economic decisions based upon these expectations, the government policy is not time consistent. On the contrary, if the government were to follow a time consistent policy, this would not be optimal. To illustrate this theory, Kydland and Prescott used some very accessible examples such as the following. Imagine a flood plain in which the government does not want its citizens to build their houses because it would have to construct dams in order to protect the houses. If there were houses in this plain, however, it would be optimal for the government to construct dams to protect its citizens. Consequently, if rational agents are certain that the government is not going to build dams to protect the plain, they will not build houses, which would be the best outcome for the economy as a whole. On the other hand, since the citizens know that, once the houses are there, the optimal choice for the government is to construct the dams and hence rational citizens will build houses in the flood plain. Now, what is the solution to this time inconsistency problem? The only solution can be summarized in one single word: commitment. Commitment in this case means that the government abandons control over certain policy options in order to credibly communicate to its subjects that policy is not going to be changed in the future. In the above example, if the government could enact a law that prohibits it from constructing dams in the flood plain, implying that the decision on dams would no longer be in its hands, citizens would not expect the government to change its mind and consequently they would not build their houses in the flood plain. BIS Review 84/2006 1 
Whenever a time consistency problem arises, policy rules of some kind are clearly superior to discretionary policy. Policy rules can be understood as any mechanism that helps the government to credibly commit to a certain policy and which prevents it from changing its mind later on. In the domain of monetary economics, the issue of policy rules was picked up in the late 1980s. Most important was the work of Bennet McCallum but also of John Taylor who introduced the famous "Taylor rule".  Bounded discretion versus explicit policy rules The idea behind rules is to give up the discretionary influence that policy makers have upon monetary policy. This is to make credible that monetary policy only depends upon the predetermined factors that are included in the rule. Since economic agents can cross check the results, credibility can easily be achieved. Another advantage of rules is the ease with which the public can determine its expectations. Under a regime led by rules, at least some if not all elements that guide monetary policy are observable and thus agents can derive future monetary policy by means of the rule. But policy rules do have important drawbacks, which in the end are the reason why they are never used in practice as a guide for the conduct of monetary policy. John Taylor himself notes it in his famous 1993 article that "[…] operating the rule requires judgement and cannot be done by the computer". What he means is that policy rules have the disadvantage of being inflexible. Since a rule must include some variables at the expense of others, it is obviously ill-prepared to unforeseen shocks that affect the economy. For example some demand shocks might require a quick response by the monetary authority in order to guarantee price stability. A solution to this problem consists in using a broader definition of a policy rule. Taylor gives the example of patent laws. If an inventor obtains a patent, he has the right to exploit a certain principle for a couple of years. The details of the invention are not subject to the patent. In a similar way, a policy rule can be understood as a set of objectives and targets subject to which the monetary authority takes its decisions. In this sense, bounded discretion is a systematic collection of discretionary policy actions which, while leaving the flexibility to react to unforeseen events, offers the credibility and purposefulness of a rule. 1.2  Time inconsistency and policy There are hardly any scientific publications in economics that had as important an impact on day-to-day policy-making as the contribution of Kydland and Prescott. Soon after identifying the inherent time inconsistency problem of optimal policy plans with rational expectations, similar problems were discovered in many areas of economic policy. The most important and influential ones were the time inconsistency problems concerning capital taxation in fiscal policy and the output inflation trade-off in monetary policy. Although both problems reside in different domains of public policy the core of both remains the same. In addition to dealing with these, I will also review a peculiar kind of time inconsistency related to fiscal sustainability. 1.2.1 Fiscal policy One important finding in the domain of public finance is the Ramsey principle of optimal factor income taxation. Developed in 1927 by the economist Frank Ramsey, it asserts that the input factor with the lowest elasticity of substitution should be taxed most. In order to keep the distortionary effects of taxation as moderate as possible, those factors that react least to taxation should be taxed most. Since the savings of today are the capital stock of tomorrow, a problem of time inconsistency arises in capital taxation. In order to promote savings and assure the capital stock of tomorrow, the government has to be wary of the elasticity of substitution of capital. That is to say, the government must account for the relatively high mobility of capital. This implies setting a low tax rate on capital income. Ex-post however, once capital is installed, its mobility drops to zero. Applying the same Ramsey principle then, implies taxing capital at 100 %. Of course rational individuals would anticipate this outcome, and not save in the first place. Again the government needs a commitment mechanism that helps it to credibly communicate that it won’t change its mind. In this case, reputation serves in part as such a mechanism. Besides the Ramsey principle, time inconsistency could feed through to another avenue in public finance. At a given point in time, governments could be tempted to depart from the optimal strategy, 2 BIS Review 84/2006 
i.e. fiscal soundness. They could, for instance, increase public expenditure in order to accommodate the demands of the median voter or specific constituencies. This move would of course result in higher deficits and therefore future taxes. However, governments are in a position to conceal this uncomfortable message over the short or even the medium term, at least if the "rational expectations" assumption is relaxed. First, it could make overly optimistic macroeconomic projections in order to hide the challenge to fiscal sustainability. Second, it could throw a veil of mist on this problem by capitalising on the uncertainty inherent in the definition and measurement of sustainability, especially over a long-term horizon. In many cases, the "true state of the world" will be disclosed well after the government responsible for higher expenditure has departed. This form of time inconsistency is quite peculiar and distinct from the concept I referred to so far. In the latter, as already said, the government might "betray" the citizens by pretending to follow a certain policy and by acting differently ex post. In the current, "peculiar" form of the concept, the government would confuse the citizens ex ante by pretending to follow a rigorous fiscal policy. The "true state of the world" would manifest itself through higher deficits or other breaches of sustainability, probably when it would be too late to address this challenge in an efficient way. The government does not renege on its promises in an active way, through the implementation of new, explicit measures, but it distorts ex ante the "true state of the world". Two commitment mechanisms could mitigate this peculiar kind of time inconsistency. First, independent budgetary institutions could be set up. They would endeavour to lift the veil of uncertainty, for instance by conducting independent macroeconomic projections. These projections could be the cornerstone of the elaboration of general government budgets (central government, social security, State and local governments). Independent institutions could also be in charge of measuring and monitoring fiscal sustainability based on long-term projections. Such institutions are already in place in many countries, in particular in small, open economies. Let me mention as examples Belgium (High Council of Finance), The Netherlands (the Central Planning Bureau provides independent macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts), Denmark (Economic Council) and Austria (Government Debt Committee). In Luxembourg, to a certain extent, the BCL assumes the role of an independent fiscal institution. Accordingly the BCL staff continuously analyses the situation and structure of the Luxembourg economy. This enables the BCL to comment on the fiscal sustainability and time consistency of policy actions taken by the government. Examples for this are the general government budget deficit, which amounted to 1.9% of GDP in 2005 after significant surpluses from 1993 to 2002 and a balanced situation in 2003. The BCL explicitly warned the government of risks to the fiscal balance well in advance, already in 2002. Furthermore, the demographical and macroeconomic challenge to the pension system, which by now is widely acknowledged, was subject to a BCL working paper in 2003. The health system was also under scrutiny in several issues of the BCL monthly bulletin. In these respects the BCL by adding an independent and critical point of view to the policy of the government enhances consistency in the process of policy-making in Luxembourg. The major problem the BCL faces in these independent monitoring tasks is the absence of sufficiently detailed information on budget outturns, in particular as regards direct taxes and the implementation of the expenditure programmes of the so-called "special" extra-budgetary funds. The setting up of an independent council – for instance along the lines of the Belgian "Conseil Supérieur des Finances" – with a transparent flow of information between the participants could help overcome this problem. Numerical fiscal rules and multi-annual budgetary frameworks are also essential in this respect. Since they constrain ex ante the behaviour of governments, for instance via expenditure limits, the scope for time inconsistent policies is narrowed. Independent budgetary institutions could be in charge of monitoring the implementation of fiscal rules. These institutions could contribute to improving the definition of fiscal rules, which is of paramount importance. For instance, expenditure rules will not effectively influence budgetary outcomes if they overlook the transactions carried out by extra-budgetary institutions or funds. The rules and their definitions would ideally be enshrined in law. The fact that legal acts are more difficult to change is a protection against time inconsistency. According to a recent study of the European Commission, legally binding rules tend to be more efficient than softer rules. 1.2.2  Monetary policy In 1958 London School of Economics professor A. W. Phillips published an article in which he showed an empirical connection between wage inflation and unemployment. His data on British wage inflation BIS Review 84/2006 3 
and the unemployment rate covered the timeperiod between 1861 and 1957 and showed a negative relation between the rate of change in nominal wages and the number of people without a job. Of course the idea that a trade-off between employment and inflation exists was and still is a very tempting one to politicians. The so-called Phillips curve could then be interpreted as a menu card that allows politicians to choose whether they want to have high inflation or high unemployment. Soon the temptation was followed and many governments tried to fight unemployment by conducting inflationary monetary policy. However, when the attempt was made to exploit the above relationship, it collapsed. The employment-inflation trade-off that seemed stable for a whole century broke down during the late 1960s and early 1970s. All of a sudden, those countries that tried to fight unemployment with inflationary policy ended up with both: high inflation and unemployment. Time inconsistency, could again be made responsible for this puzzling fact. Moreover, the solution to the collapse of the Phillips curve was to become the foundation of modern central banking. The output-inflation trade-off example In the late 1960s and the first half of the 1970s, the reason for the breakdown of the relationship discovered by Phillips was found. It was mainly due to Friedman, Phelps and Lucas that the difficulty with the simplistic "menu-card" view of politics was unveiled. The newly discovered expectations played a main role in their arguments. The most important thing to comprehend, these academics claimed, was that the relationship between unemployment and inflation was stable only when inflation expectations were stable. If this was not the case, then the relationship itself would change in structure, and hence collapse. The Phillips curve would simply shift. The key argument was that inflation expectations of individuals enter the relationship between unemployment and inflation because individuals need a measure of inflation to determine the next periods’ real wage. In the end, real variables like unemployment or output can only be determined by real variables like the real wage. Once individuals have adapted their expectations to the accommodative monetary policy of the monetary authority, further monetary expansion is like pushing on a string. It can only lead to high inflation, leaving unemployment unaltered. The time inconsistency nature of this problem lies in the fact that only unanticipated inflation leads to lower unemployment because it depresses real wages. Again, the socially optimal strategy of the monetary authority changes between periods. Ex-ante it is optimal to follow a restrictive monetary policy aiming at low inflation. Ex-post however, when expectations of the public are formed, and have induced a certain behaviour of the agents, it is optimal for the monetary authority to defect and produce "surprise"-inflation. The monetary authority, however, cannot permanently fool agents with rational expectations, because they are aware of the incentives of the monetary authority to regress on its decision about inflation. So in the end, any attempt of the monetary authority to exploit the Phillips-relationship is doomed to produce inflation without reducing unemployment. A related example in the Luxembourgish context consists in the nominal wage-indexation rule, which characterizes wage setting behaviour in the Grand Duchy. The wage-indexation rule may in a model of the Phillips curve, prima facie, seem as a device to stabilize inflation expectations, and alleviate the inflationary bias. However some important caveats do apply. Wage-indexation is per definition backward looking so that information concerning expectations is ignored. Moreover, it is prone to supply shocks that strike the economy and may, through second-round effects, heat the wage-price spiral. Recent oil price increases, to name but the most prominent example, have fed into price increases, which in turn have triggered several increases of the index. Through this channel supply shocks have a stronger and more lasting effect than they would without indexation. Several alternatives to resolve this problem have been suggested, mostly by excluding goods with high price volatility from the relevant inflation measure or by tying the index to price developments in neighbouring countries. Further caveats concerning wage-indexation point out that it introduces rigidities into labour markets, which hampers adjustment processes. Lastly by mitigating the cost of inflation for wage earners it may reduce the will to fight inflation. Hereby wage-indexation influences the incentives and hence the credibility of the authorities. 4 BIS Review 84/2006 
2  The monetary policy of the Eurosystem and the time inconsistency problem 2.1 Central banking and the time inconsistency problem The insight on the time inconsistency problem of monetary policy made it clear that some sort of commitment device was necessary in order to overcome the inflation bias of monetary policy. Research had shown that under discretionary monetary policy certain equilibria were not attainable in the presence of rational agents. In the 1980s several proposals were made on how to resolve this problem. One idea was for the monetary authority to invest in "good reputation" by continuously fighting inflation and by this shape the expectations of the private sector concerning future inflation. In the end it was the economist Kenneth Rogoff who showed that a good solution was to delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank. The incentives set for the central bank had to be such that it would be able to make economic agents believe in its determination to deliver price stability. For instance, one could make the central bank president’s wage depend on the degree of price stability that his policy delivers. New Zealand went even further as according to his employment contract, the Governor can be dismissed if the inflation rate exceeds the target. The Governor of the Bank of England has to explain the underlying reasons and to present appropriate monetary policy measures if inflation deviates more than 1 p. p. from the target set by the Government. So to delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank was supposed to allow for a good balance between credibility and flexibility. On the grounds of these arguments central banks throughout the world were reformed with a special focus on giving them more operational independence. Independent central banks have to keep in touch with markets and guide market participants through sensible monetary policy. The central banks’ obligations are mainly twofold. On the one hand a central bank has to conduct monetary policy such that price stability is maintained. On the other hand, central banks can help to stabilise the economy, when it is shaken by fluctuations. Those obligations are two sides to one medal and what is of utmost importance to fulfil them is credibility. On February 7th 1991 the Treaty on European Union was signed in Maastricht. After having experienced an extended period of very high inflation between the mid 1960s and the mid 1980s, an essential aim of the participating nations was to assure price stability. In order to achieve this, the aim of price stability and the independence of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) were enshrined in the Treaty. Next, I will present the strategy of the Eurosystem to you, thereby focusing especially on the issue of time consistency. 2.2 The Eurosystem monetary policy As a relatively young organisation, the ESCB with at its heart the ECB was able from start to cherish the fruits of the research I just presented. As a result, many important results were implemented straightaway. The first and foremost example thereof is the crucial role that is given to price stability. To manifest this importance, Article 105 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the primary objective of the ESCB "[…] is to maintain price stability". All other objectives are subordinate to this. Obviously, this is to make clear to the public, that the ESCB is committed to price stability only. To emphasise this, the article continues: "[w]ithout prejudice to the goal of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Community […]". 2.2.1 Commitment devices of the Eurosystem As I just described, it is not only important to clearly state a certain goal in order to influence expectations. The other important and presumably more difficult part is to make that statement credible to the public. In order to make its monetary policy ambitions credible, the Eurosystem needs devices that prove its determination to maintain price stability. A key ingredient, if not the most important, for credibility, is a clear quantitative definition of price stability. Milton Friedman, at the time, trusted neither politicians nor central bankers and thus advocated a constitutional rule that required constant money growth. Constitutions are devices well suited to prove the seriousness of a purpose. Since it is hard to change them, even for politicians, they provide a BIS Review 84/2006 5 
strong insurance against a government changing its mind. It is certainly with this fact in mind that the price stability target was included in the article 105 of the Treaty on European Union. As a primordial prerequisite for the monetary union and considering the above-mentioned time inconsistency issues, the Treaty is the appropriate place for defining the major objective of the ESCB. In order to further clarify this target, the Governing Council of the ECB defined price stability in October 1998 as: "[…] a year-on-year increase in the HICP for the euro area of below 2 %". In May 2003 the Governing Council further narrowed its target by restraining inflation rates to be "[…] below but close to 2 % over the medium term". A clearly defined and appropriately fixed objective is one part of ensuring credibility. The other part is taking responsibility for the results of monetary policy. This gives the public the opportunity to hold the Eurosystem accountable. The fact that the target is clearly defined makes it easier to evaluate the results of the policy measures taken. Accountability is important since with central bank independence it is difficult to sanction its actions. Transparency is a key prerequisite for accountability. An important part of transparency lies in the definition of the targeted inflation rate. Furthermore, the steps taken to achieve this goal have to be clarified as well. An important instrument in this respect is the two-pillar strategy of the Eurosystem. By analysing the real and the monetary side of the economy and by subsequently cross checking the results of this analysis all decisions can be justified. Moreover, policy decisions, once they have been taken, understood easily by the public, since the underlying data is published regularly. The ECB tries to meet all these communication requirements with its wide range of publications and press conferences. The credibility and the independence of monetary policy is enhanced if fiscal discipline prevails. In spite of the monetary union, fiscal policy remains in the hands of the national states. In order to guarantee the soundness of national budgets and to avoid any disruptions to the mechanisms of monetary transmission induced by fiscal imbalances, the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact puts certain constraints upon the ability of Member States to run deficits and make debt. 2.2.2  Inflation and expected inflation in the Euro area Central banks throughout the world have built up their reputation over time. Among the best known are obviously the United States’ Federal Reserve, the Bank of England or previously the Bundesbank. This tradition implies that market participants have some experience on how those central banks conduct their monetary policy, how they react to shocks and how "hawkish" or "dovish" they are on inflation. Reputation helps those central banks enhance their credibility and stabilize markets because it reduces uncertainty. The Eurosystem did not have such a track record when it started its mission in 1999. Market participants first had to collect some experience on the Eurosystem monetary policy conduct. Since the introduction of the Euro in 1999, the average HICP inflation rate according to Eurostat was 1,97 percent, since 2000 the average lies around 2,1 percent. This is very close to the price stability set.  As I laid out to you, stabilising prices implies stabilising expectations on prices, since inflation expectations are as important to economic processes as actual inflation is. In order to gauge the public’s assessment on how committed the Eurosystem is to fight inflation, I will report the results of the Survey of Professional Forecasters to you. This survey has been carried out by the ECB since early 1999, and consists of a questionnaire on expectations sent to experts affiliated with financial or non-financial institutions based within the EU. The expectations are reported for several time-periods. For example, one year ahead inflation expectations started off at a level of 1,2 percent in the first quarter 1999. They reached a temporary maximum in the second quarter 2002 at a value of 1,9 and during the whole period from 1999 until the beginning of 2006 they never crossed the 2 percent barrier. Only recently, in the second quarter of 2006, did one year ahead inflation forecasts rise to 2,1 percent reflecting the oil price and fiscal shocks (i.e. the German VAT increase) the Euro area is undergoing. Concerning longer-term expectations, the forecasts are similar. Expectations on two year ahead HICP inflation rates vary mainly between 1,5 and 1,9 percentage points. These results can be interpreted as a proof of confidence of the "expert" public in the ability of the Eurosystem to achieve its target. Important and complementary indicators for the credibility the Eurosystem are longer term inflation expectations. These are more stable and less affected by different shocks than short term expectations. For example, short-term expectations are for the moment influenced by rising oil prices 6 BIS Review 84/2006 
or the insecure political situation in the middle East. In the long run, the fundamental economic data are of more relevance for inflation expectations. Long term average inflation expectations as reported by the ECB’s Survey of professional forecasters have been at 1,9 % for the last 18 quarters consecutively. Very similar results have also been extracted from other surveys like that of ‘Consensus Economics’ or the ‘Euro Zone Barometer’. Overall, the Eurosystem has achieved credibility among market participants. This is also very important considering the uncertain environment, which the Governing Council of the ECB faces, in its day-to-day decision-making. In what follows, I am going to touch on this issue. 3  Monetary policy and uncertainty Far from the deterministic world of models in which researchers can exactly predict the effects of a change in a certain variable, there is the real world, which the Governing Council of the ECB faces at its monthly meetings. There are many possible disturbances that feed the monetary framework with uncertainty in numerous respects. In the recent past, we had to deal with terrorist attacks, asset price bubbles and extraordinary rises in the oil price, just to mention a few. All of these events affect and change the structure of the framework a central bank has to deal with and add uncertainty to the process of conducting monetary policy. Among the many forms of uncertainty the most relevant for central banks is twofold. The first concerns the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the second is about the current state of the economy. Concerning the mechanism of monetary policy transmission first of all, since the introduction of the Euro we have noticed an important move towards a closer integration of capital markets and the banking system. This has impacting repercussions on the way and the amount by which interest rate decisions are passed through to the economies. Nevertheless, since the Euro area still remains heterogeneous in structure, the pass-through may be quick in one region while it is rather stodgy in another. Recent labour market reforms in several member states as well as changes in social security systems influence the transmission mechanism further. All this continuously affects the process at hand and the Euro area of today may well be quite different from that of 1999. The second important source of uncertainty concerns the state of the economy. Again the division can be made between aggregate uncertainty and uncertainty at the country level. Among experts the opinion is not always unanimous concerning the state of the economy. There are many indicators and many ways of interpreting them, so discriminating between a temporary slowdown of the economy and the beginning of a recession or between a sound recovery and irrational exuberance is not always obvious. It is no wonder that at times reference is made to the "art of central banking". In order to cope with the special situation of the Euro area and with uncertainty in general the Eurosystem applies several instruments, which are either substitutes or complementary to each other. To start with, a solid foundation for monetary policy was created. The detailed and published monetary policy strategy reduces the uncertainty on behalf of the public concerning the objectives and behaviour of the Eurosystem. As I have just explained the Eurosystem tries to achieve the highest possible reliability by means of a clear objective and a high degree of transparency and accountability. The Eurosystem tries to reduce uncertainty about the structure of the economy to the maximum extent possible through the systematized analysis of the full information set, i.e. the renowned two-pillar strategy. By closely monitoring the real and the monetary side of the economic situation of the Euro area, the Eurosystem gathers all available information and by cross checking this information, the uncertainty is reduced to a minimum. Furthermore, in order to be prepared for broader changes in market structure and to foster the understanding of economics a heavy weight is laid on the conduct of genuine research. Lastly considering the remaining uncertainty, policy is generally conducted in a cautious manner. Indeed, the main body of literature considers a "non-activist" and gradualist policy conduct to be optimal in most cases of parameter uncertainty. 4  Conclusion Kydland and Prescott have shown in their work about time inconsistency of policy, how important it is for a government (or a monetary authority) to make itself and its policy credible among the public. This has led to widespread reforms in the sector of central banking throughout the world in the mid- to late- 1980s and the Authors of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union have integrated these insights. BIS Review 84/2006 7 
By carefully adopting a specific monetary policy strategy appropriate for the Euro zone, the Eurosystem succeeded, even without a track record and in spite of many turbulences and shocks of various markets, to keep inflation low and close to its target. Moreover, inflation expectations, a key indicator for the trust of the public in the policy of the Eurosystem, were also kept at a level compatible with the announced definition of price stability. In conclusion the time inconsistency problem has been well solved in the practice of modern central banking, notably by the Eurosystem. Even if uncertainty and unforeseen events, have in the past and will in the future prevail, the ECB has had a good start and achieved credibility with the public. This has been achieved by means of a framework that on the one hand delivers the determination necessary for credibility and on the other gives the flexibility that is essential to react to unforeseen events.

Lars Nyberg: The Riksbank's monetary policy strategy Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Foreign Banker’s Association, Stockholm, 14 September 2006. *      *      * Introduction Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation. It is a pleasure to be able to come here and talk about the Riksbank and our monetary policy. When conducting modern monetary policy, it is important that the principles guiding interest rate decisions are known to all. Monetary policy largely has an effect through its influence on expectations of future inflation and interest rates. Therefore, we regularly describe our views on economic developments in our Inflation Reports and publish the minutes of our monetary policy meetings to enable everyone to understand the considerations we make. In addition, twice a year the Governor of the Riksbank holds a public speech for the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) Committee on Finance and responds to questions from members of parliament and journalists. Moreover, we Executive Board members hold a large number of speeches, in which we discuss various aspects of the Swedish economy and explain our interest rate decisions. I should say that a continuous debate on monetary policy and its terms is a necessary condition for the policy to function satisfactorily. One difficulty with monetary policy is that it does not have an immediate impact. It is therefore necessary to base monetary policy decisions on forecasts of future inflation and developments in the real economy. Of course, these forecasts are uncertain and can also be made in different ways. One of the main purposes of the Inflation Reports is to explain how we make them, so that others can question us and discuss our methods. I shall return to the forecasts, as we have recently changed our methods in this area. During the spring I and my colleagues on the Executive Board described in a number of speeches the principles that guide our monetary policy. In May we also published a special document where we described these principles.1 One of the reasons why we considered it important to publish such a document was that there had been a lively debate on monetary policy for some time with disparate opinions. For instance, some people considered we should have more than one objective for monetary policy, in addition to the inflation target. Others claimed that we already had more than one objective, while some debaters pointed out that more than one objective risked creating confusion. Although the debate has not been quite so lively since then – which may of course be connected with the fact that we have had a long, pleasant summer that may have turned people's thoughts to other matters than monetary policy – I see that monetary policy is still sometimes described in a way that I do not really recognise. Two questions in particular tend to arise: Do we only take into account inflation, or do we also care about the real economy, for instance, the employment situation? And what do we think of the rapid increase in household indebtedness and in property prices? The aims of monetary policy To understand the monetary policy decisions, it is of course essential that there is no uncertainty regarding the objective of monetary policy. There is only one statutory objective for monetary policy and that is to maintain price stability. We at the Riksbank have then chosen to specify this objective in terms of an explicit inflation target. This entails an annual change in the consumer price index (CPI) of 2 per cent with a tolerance interval of ± 1 percentage point. One might ask why we allow a certain measure of inflation when Parliament has given us the task of maintaining price stability. One reason why we have chosen not to set the inflation target at zero is that an inflation target that is too low can under certain circumstances create adverse conditions for employment. There is an inbuilt resistance within the economy to nominal reductions in prices and                                                       1  See “Monetary policy in Sweden", Sveriges Riksbank (this document can be downloaded from the Riksbank’s website, www.riksbank.com, or ordered as a booklet).

wages and a certain measure of inflation can therefore make it easier to implement necessary changes in relative prices and wages. A consensus has developed among the countries with economic policy aimed at price stability that a reasonable rate of inflation is around 2 per cent. At the same time, I would like to point out that there are no scientific grounds for determining exactly how an inflation target should be formulated. Of course, it is impossible to have the ambition that inflation should always be close to two per cent in all situations. The economy is exposed to unexpected shocks and these cannot be immediately counteracted as monetary policy’s impact comes after a time lag. An attempt to bring inflation back on target too quickly may also lead to unnecessarily large costs for the real economy. Let me explain what I mean here. Monetary policy cares about the real economy If inflation is for some reason above or below the inflation target, it is necessary to decide how quickly it should be brought back on target. In these situations we have good reason and good opportunity to take into account developments in the real economy and not merely in prices. If, for instance, an increase in the price of energy has brought inflation well above two per cent, it would be possible to use a large interest rate hike to quickly bring inflation back on target. However, this has a price in the form of slowing down economic growth. If high productivity growth and low import prices were instead to lead to inflation being well below two per cent, it might be possible to correct the problem quickly by cutting the interest rate. However, this would risk stimulating the economy in a way that would not always be desirable. By bringing inflation back on target at a slower rate, the real economy will develop in a more stable manner. We can thus contribute to stability, although monetary policy cannot affect the long-term growth rate in the economy. It is not stated in the law that the Riksbank should take developments in the real economy into account in addition to the price stability target. On the other hand, it was stated in the preparatory works for the Sveriges Riksbank Act that the Riksbank, without prejudice to the price stability target, should support the goals of general economic policy with a view to maintaining a sustainable level of growth and employment.  Not having the ambition of bringing inflation back on target as quickly as possible thus creates flexibility in formulating monetary policy that provides scope to take into account developments in the real economy. At the same time, it is important that this flexibility should not give rise to doubts about maintaining the inflation target in the long term. This is why we have chosen to specify a time horizon, which states that monetary policy should normally be aimed at achieving the inflation target within two years. The two-year horizon should be interpreted as a restriction as to how much consideration can normally be given to real economic developments. It is a restriction that we have imposed upon ourselves – like the specified inflation target – to create credibility for the price stability target. Similar reasoning lies behind the set tolerance interval we have chosen around the target. While the tolerance interval provides an interval within which inflation can normally be expected to fluctuate as a result of unexpected shocks and insufficient knowledge of exactly how monetary policy affects the economy, it provides a limit as to the size of the deviations that can be tolerated. However, let me point out that there can be certain situations where the shocks to the economy are so great that there is reason to allow even longer than two years to bring inflation back on target. If our assessment was that such a situation had arisen, we would make this clear when publishing our monetary policy decisions. One condition is that we do not find ourselves in a situation where we would risk undermining confidence in the inflation target or in monetary policy. These thoughts on how to take into account developments in the real economy are of course not unique to the Riksbank. Although the guidelines for inflation-targeting monetary policy vary slightly from one country to another, all central banks with inflation targets conduct monetary policy that to some extent takes into account the real economy. This is usually termed flexible inflation-targeting. In other words, we are not “inflation nutters”, who want to bring inflation back on target as quickly as possible, whatever the cost. The importance of inflation forecasts for interest rate decisions Let me move on to talk about the assumption for the repo rate that we use when making forecasts in our Inflation Report.  2 BIS Review 84/2006 
The forecasts in the main scenario in the Riksbank’s Inflation Report have been based over the years on the assumption that the repo rate is held unchanged during the forecast period. This assumption had the advantage of providing a very simple and clear policy rule for monetary policy: If the forecast for inflation at the end of the forecast period was below two per cent, the repo rate would normally be cut, and if it was above two per cent the interest rate would be raised. If the forecast was very close to two per cent the repo rate would remain unchanged. Of course, this rule could not capture all of the nuances in the monetary policy discussion, but it provided a rough explanation of the monetary policy decisions. However, there were several disadvantages with the assumption of a constant repo rate. In situations where the market expected clearly rising or falling interest rates, it was difficult to compare our forecasts based on the assumption of a constant repo rate with those made by other forecasters. One reason was that the assumption of a constant repo rate often resulted in our forecasts for inflation differing from those of other forecasters; being higher when inflation was rising and lower when inflation was declining. This caused confusion in the discussions on monetary policy.  Since October last year, our forecasts are instead based on the technical assumption that the repo rate will develop in line with market expectations regarding the future repo rate, as expressed in the implied forward rates. This has made it easier to compare ourselves with other inflation forecasters and also to assess our monetary policy.2  The new interest rate assumption we now apply means that we can no longer use our old policy rule. If the forecast with a constant repo rate was close to two per cent, the repo rate would be held unchanged according to the old policy rule. If the forecast according to the new outlook shows inflation close to two per cent, the repo rate will normally develop in the way reflected by market expectations. This could mean that the repo rate, given the underlying inflation forecast, should be raised or lowered in a number of stages over the coming two-year period. The new outlook thus means that the monetary policy discussion is based on an interest rate path throughout the entire forecast period, while the old policy rule only took into account what should be done at the time the decision was made. I have seen several examples where the old policy rule is used in discussions concerning the new interest rate path. This is fatal, as it can lead to entirely wrong expectations of monetary policy. The old policy rule is dead and the market now needs to bury it. Even with the new outlook we care about developments in the real economy when making monetary policy decision. If, for instance, the forecast inflation rate were to be close to target two years ahead, but showed a rapid acceleration at the same time as growth in the real economy was high, it is possible that the implied forward rate path could not be expected to reflect a desirable development in the repo rate. In this type of situation it is possible that the repo rate would need to be raised more quickly at the beginning of the forecast period. When we make our decisions regarding the repo rate, we thus do not merely look to see whether inflation is close to target two years ahead, we take into account the entire development paths for inflation and the real economy. A desirable monetary policy is characterised by inflation under normal circumstances being close to the inflation target in a two-year time perspective while at the same time the paths for inflation and the real economy do not exhibit excessively large fluctuations. For the record, I would like to point out here that the forecast assumption that the repo rate will follow implied forward rates does not of course entail any commitment from the Riksbank that this will be the case. We have no unique information about the future. We cannot in advance commit monetary policy to a particular sequence of future interest rate changes, as future economic developments are uncertain. The stand we take regarding the development of the repo rate at our monetary policy meetings is based on the information available at the time the decision is made. Our considerations can and should change if the economy develops in a manner different to that we had expected.                                                       2  This is further described in the box entitled, ”Changes in the Riksbank’s forecasting methods”, Inflation Report 2005:1, in Irma Rosenberg’s speech ”The Riksbank and monetary policy” at Danske Bank, 29 September 2005 and in Lars Heikensten’s speech, ”Thoughts on how to develop the Riksbank’s monetary policy work”, at the Swedish Economics Association on 22 February 2005. BIS Review 84/2006 3 
Managing risks in monetary policy decisions As monetary policy must be based on uncertain forecasts of the future, there is a need to manage the risk that the economy will develop in a way different to what was expected by the central bank. The former Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan called this the risk management approach to policy. Given this way of thinking, our Inflation Reports contain a special section where we discuss alternative scenarios for inflation and the real economy and the probability that these will materialise. It is the forecast of inflation and the real economy taking into account the risks of alternative scenarios that forms the basis of our monetary policy decisions.  Of course, it is not appropriate for a risk analysis to take into account all imaginable risks; not even all those that would have dramatic consequences if they were to materialise. For instance, it is not reasonable, in my opinion, to allow monetary policy decisions to be governed by the risk of global imbalances, as we are unable to affect this development through our own monetary policy.3 On the other hand, I consider that it is important to always take into account risks that arise from the monetary policy conducted, even if it is sometimes difficult to quantify these risks and calculate their consequences. One problem faced by many central banks with inflation targets, and which relates to this, is the risk of unfavourable developments in property prices and household indebtedness as a result of a long period of expansionary monetary policy. Sweden is no exception here.  Both cyclical and structural factors justify the growth rate in household debts and property prices being high over a period of time in Sweden and there is thus reason to take this into account in the normal analysis and forecasting work. Rising house prices lead to wealth effects that influence decisions regarding consumption and saving. Developments in debt affect the impact of interest rate changes on consumption. This does not necessarily entail any dramatic consequences. However, when the rates of increase remain at a high level for a long period of time, there is an increased risk of imbalances in the build up of debt and in house prices. This could in a worst case scenario lead to large fluctuations in both inflation and the real economy further ahead. The question is how to manage the risk of this type of imbalance occurring. One way of managing this and similar risks is to make a change in the repo rate sooner or later than would otherwise be assessed as the most appropriate timing, given the forecasts for inflation and the real economy. Let me illustrate this with a brief summary of our reasoning in connection with the monetary policy decision made in February this year. We then raised the repo rate, despite the fact that the inflation forecast in itself could have warranted waiting some time before implementing an increase. Our assessment was that there were other circumstances that indicated the repo rate should be increased in February, but that it could thereafter be raised at a slightly slower rate. The very expansionary monetary policy conducted in recent years, together with the weaker krona, has stimulated the economy considerably. It has contributed to our now being in a situation where household indebtedness and house prices have increased at a more rapid rate than can be regarded as sustainable in the long term. Our assessment at the monetary policy meeting in February was that a slightly earlier increase in the repo rate would reduce the risk of an abrupt adjustment in house prices and household indebtedness further ahead, which might have adverse consequences for both inflation and the real economy. One could say that, bearing this risk in mind, we discussed the appropriate timing of an interest rate increase that we anyway considered necessary with regard to the inflation target. I and my colleagues on the Executive Board of the Riksbank have pointed out in several different speeches that this procedure does not mean that we have introduced other objectives for monetary policy in addition to the price stability target and the aim to contribute to subduing fluctuations in the real economy. We expressed this quite clearly in the special document on monetary policy strategy we published prior to the summer. It therefore surprises me when I still see monetary policy described in some contests in a way that implies that we have other objectives besides price stability when making decisions on the repo rate.  I would also like to emphasise that our management of the risk of an adverse development in house prices and household indebtedness does not in any way mean that we consider that these aspects                                                       3  See also Tucker, P., (2006), "Reflections on operating inflation targeting”, Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin: Summer 2006. 4 BIS Review 84/2006 
have greater relevance for what is regarded as desirable monetary policy than, for instance, the situation in the labour market. From time to time situations will arise where we will need to take into account, in a different way than the usual, the risks of adverse economic developments that are difficult to quantify. Recently this has been house prices and household indebtedness, but in the future it could be other variables. This is an important dimension of the flexibility in our inflation-targeting policy. The current situation Let me conclude with a few comments on our most recent monetary policy decision. A more detailed account is provided in the separate minutes of the monetary policy meeting, which were published the day before yesterday.  We chose at our monetary policy meeting on 29 August to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points. Now that we have chosen to conduct less expansionary monetary policy, this is because we have made the assessment that it is necessary to avoid inflation being above target a couple of years ahead, while at the same time it contributes to a balanced development in the real economy. The increase in the repo rate is in line with the repo rate path expected by the market and which was used as a basis for the inflation forecast.  On the one hand, the high GDP growth indicates that inflation could rise more quickly in future than we assumed in June. But on the other hand, productivity has been slightly stronger than expected, which has contributed to holding back cost developments and the rate of increase in unit labour costs. This has a dampening effect on inflation. However, there are indications that the labour market is beginning to strengthen, which should contribute to rising cost pressures. Our overall assessment was that inflation will increase and will be in line with the target a couple of years ahead, given that the repo rate is increased approximately in line with market expectations.  Our assessment at the monetary policy meeting was that the upside risks and downside risks were roughly equal. Among the upside risks we mentioned were higher energy, oil and electricity prices, with a risk of contagion effects and a higher rate of wage increase following on from good growth in the economy. The downside risks included the continued strong domestic productivity growth and international price pressures. With regard to household indebtedness and house prices, we expect that the growth rates will slow down, but we have not yet seen any certain signs of this. The picture painted earlier in the year still remains largely unchanged. Our assessment throughout the year has been that the outlook for inflation and the economy over the coming years indicates that it is reasonable to assume the repo rate will need to be gradually increased. In accordance with this view, we have raised the repo rate four times so far this year and my assessment is that the repo rate will need to be raised further in future. However, as I mentioned earlier, we both can and should change our assessment if the economy develops in a manner we had not expected.  Thank you!  BIS Review 84/2006 5 
Susan Schmidt Bies: Basel II and commercial real estate  Testimony of Ms Susan Schmidt Bies, Member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, before the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, Washington, DC, 14 September 2006.  *      *      * Chairman Bachus, Representative Sanders, and members of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, I thank you for the opportunity to discuss the developments relating to bank regulatory capital requirements in the United States, including the U.S. implementation of Basel II and updates to regulatory capital rules for market risk, as well as the regulatory agencies' proposed guidance on commercial real estate (CRE) concentration risk. Developments related to regulatory capital requirements in the United States As Subcommittee members may know, last week there were some very positive developments in the process to revise regulatory capital requirements for large, internationally active U.S. banking institutions. First, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation board approved the Basel II notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on the advanced capital adequacy framework, commonly referred to as Basel II. At the same time, the FDIC board approved an NPR that would update the U.S. regulatory capital rules for market risk exposures. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision took similar actions on the same day. Together with the Federal Reserve's approval of the draft Basel II NPR in March and the market risk NPR in August, these steps complete all necessary approvals for the two NPRs to be published in the Federal Register for formal public comment. Proposed templates for regulatory reporting requirements associated with the two NPRs will be published in the Federal Register for comment at the same time. Regarding market risk exposures, that NPR is based on a set of revisions developed jointly by the Basel Committee and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) in 2005 to update the Market Risk Amendment (MRA), developed a decade ago by the Basel Committee. These amendments would apply to any banking organization that has significant trading book activity, whether it stays on Basel I or moves to Basel II in the United States. The market risk NPR is intended to improve the risk sensitivity of the market risk capital framework. Further, it will serve to level the playing field between U.S. banking organizations and securities firms that are subject to similar capital requirements. Moving to the main focus of today's hearing, the Basel II framework represents an important effort by supervisors to integrate modern risk-management practices with regulatory capital requirements. We are pleased that the four federal banking agencies have reached consensus to move ahead with the process for Basel II and the market risk update. We recognize the significance of this development to the industry, the Congress, and others who have waited for greater specificity about U.S. efforts to implement Basel II. It has taken quite a bit of work to reach this point. I would like to thank my colleagues here at this table and their staffs, as well as the Fed's own staff, for their tireless efforts. Overview of proposed rulemakings The Basel II NPR is designed to improve the risk sensitivity of U.S. bank regulatory capital requirements and to enhance the risk-measurement and -management practices of large, internationally active U.S. banking organizations. The NPR is based on the 2004 capital adequacy framework released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. That framework contains the now-familiar "three pillars" of minimum capital requirements for credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory review (Pillar 2) and public disclosure (Pillar 3). As you are aware, the agencies propose to adopt all three pillars in the United States. In Pillar 1 as proposed by the Basel II NPR, only the most advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB) for credit risk and the advanced measurement approaches (AMA) for operational risk would be available, and the framework as a whole would be required only for the largest, most complex, internationally active U.S. institutions. In contrast, in many other countries all banking organizations are required to adopt Basel II because Basel I will be dropped when Basel II takes effect. To make Basel II appropriate for the wide variety of financial BIS Review 84/2006 1 
institutions, three credit risk and three operational risk approaches were developed in the 2004 framework. The A-IRB approach for credit risk in the Basel II NPR requires institutions to estimate key risk parameters for each type of credit exposure, subject to supervisory review, and to calculate a capital requirement by using those risk parameters as inputs. The AMA approach for operational risk requires institutions to calculate a capital requirement based on their individual operational risk profile - again, subject to supervisory review. The Basel II NPR also specifies, as part of Pillar 2, that each institution must develop a rigorous internal process for assessing its overall or total capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile for other types of risk and through economic cycles. These internal assessments will enable each institution to determine the appropriate level of capital for its unique long-term business strategy. These internal capital assessments are, we believe, critically important, and are also subject to supervisory review. Finally, institutions must publicly disclose key information relating to credit and operational risks, under Pillar 3, to ensure adequate transparency for market participants, customers, and counterparties, so that market discipline can also work effectively to differentiate risk exposures among banking organizations. I would like to stress that the Basel II framework has three Pillars and note that Pillars 2 and 3 are critical components of the overall framework. They should not be overlooked. To accompany the Basel II and market risk proposals, the agencies plan to publish in the Federal Register reporting requirements for institutions planning to adopt Basel II and the updated market risk rules in the United States. Each institution that qualifies for and applies the Basel II capital rules and the updated market risk rules would file quarterly regulatory data, some of which would remain confidential, for the agencies' use in assessing and monitoring the levels and components of each reporting entity's risk-based capital requirements and the adequacy of the entity's capital. These data also would support the agencies' efforts to analyze the quantitative impact and competitive implications of the Basel II capital rules and the updated market risk rules on individual reporting entities and on an industrywide basis. In addition, the reporting schedules will help clarify for these entities our expectations surrounding the systems and other infrastructure necessary for implementation and validation of the two proposals. The submitted data would supplement on-site examination processes, and the data released publicly would provide other interested parties with information about banks' risk profiles and capital adequacy.  Importance of the regulatory capital proposals While our reasons for moving to Basel II have not changed since we began this endeavor, I believe they are worth reiterating. Our core reason is that the current Basel I framework is inadequate for the largest, most complex U.S. banking organizations. The current Basel I capital requirements simply are not able to capture the full array of risks facing these organizations. For example, they do not explicitly recognize the operational risk embedded in many of the services from which the largest institutions generate a good portion of their revenues today.  Further, Basel I does not differentiate the riskiness of assets within the major asset types based on either borrower creditworthiness or the presence of collateral or other risk mitigants. This lack of sophistication can lead to significant distortions and capital arbitrage. The capital required for the various types of exposures should reflect the unique business strategy of each institution, rather than be based on an assumed homogeneous risk position. As banks consciously choose to take higher risk exposures, Basel II requires them to hold additional capital to reflect their business choice. Basel I capital is fixed throughout economic and business credit cycles, and as such, does not require banks to increase capital as their potential for losses rises. Basel II addresses this by including in Pillar 2 the requirement that the bank have a plan in place to ensure that sufficient capital will be available in the downturn of the economic cycle. Thus, for the largest organizations, we need to move beyond Basel I to a more risk-sensitive and more comprehensive framework for assessing capital adequacy. Basel II represents the concerted efforts of the international and U.S. supervisory community, in consultation with banks and other stakeholders, to develop such a framework, drawing upon well-known economic capital concepts that the largest banks already employ as part of their risk management efforts.  In addition to its supervisory authority, the Federal Reserve, as the nation's central bank, has responsibility for maintaining stable financial markets and ensuring a strong financial system. That responsibility mandates that we require banking organizations to operate in a safe and sound manner with adequate capital that appropriately supports the risks they take. This is especially critical in today's environment where we have a growing number of banking institutions with more than $1 trillion 2 BIS Review 84/2006 
in assets, complex balance sheets, opaque off-balance sheet transactions, and far-reaching operations that pose significant risk-management challenges that are fundamentally different from those faced by smaller institutions. Naturally, we must also ensure that our regulations and supervisory oversight are in tune with bank practice, are able to identify the risks being taken by banks today, and have enough flexibility that they will continue to be prudent and relevant in an ever-changing risk environment. As Chairman Bernanke has noted, a regulatory and supervisory system that is not in tune with the financial marketplace may increase the costs of regulation, stifle efficiency and innovation, and ultimately be less effective in mitigating the moral hazard problems associated with the federal safety net. The advanced approaches of Basel II are much more risk sensitive, cover more areas of potential risk facing banking organizations, and provide incentives for these institutions to improve risk measurement and management. In addition, Basel II provides supervisors with a more conceptually consistent and more transparent framework for evaluating systemic risk in the banking system, particularly through credit cycles. In sum, Basel II will establish a more coherent relationship between regulatory measures of capital adequacy and day-to-day supervision of banks, enabling examiners to better evaluate whether banks are holding prudent levels of capital given their risk profiles. Continuing the implementation process The agencies' proposed rulemakings, representing our view about how Basel II should be implemented in the United States, are being published in the Federal Register for review by the industry, the Congress, and the general public. The core goal of Basel II, as noted earlier, is to promote the stability of the U.S. financial system by ensuring the safety and soundness of U.S. banks. As Chairman Bernanke has said, the ability of Basel II to promote safety and soundness is the first criterion on which the proposed Basel II framework should be judged. The agencies have presented proposals and will now engage in a continuing dialogue with all interested parties as to whether those proposals meet our stated objectives and can be improved.  During the entire process to develop our proposed rulemakings, the agencies have been engaged in a dialogue with the industry, the Congress, and others about both the direction that U.S. Basel II implementation should take and specific implementation details. Many of the comments received to date have been incorporated into our proposals. In that respect, we have been carefully considering comments received so far and discussing among ourselves how to address them. In addition, we have conducted extensive analysis of other information we have been collecting, such as the results of quantitative impact studies (QIS), and those results have helped shape the proposals as well. In making adjustments to our proposals based on comments and new information, we have been as transparent as possible. Going forward, we will seriously consider all comments on the proposals. For example, the proposals contain a number of specific questions soliciting comments in key areas. With these questions, the agencies are trying to highlight areas on which the agencies would like additional information. The agencies will continue to carefully consider all comments received and thoroughly analyze all relevant information as we work to develop a final rule for Basel II. I also want to acknowledge that the agencies have received comments from several banks and other parties suggesting that banks should have more choices with regard to both credit and operational risk in Basel II in the United States. We have taken these comments seriously and the NPR now includes a specific question on whether the U.S. version of Basel II should include a so-called "standardized" approach to credit risk. We look forward to receiving detailed comments on this and all aspects of the proposals. The agencies' proposals contain certain transitional safeguards beyond what is contained in the 2004 framework. Indeed, these proposed safeguards reflect our intent to ensure that there are no material weaknesses in our proposals prior to full operation. First, we continue to monitor institutions' progress toward satisfaction of the Basel II risk-measurement and -management infrastructure standards. In addition, our proposals contain a parallel-run period in which we will have the ability to analyze and directly compare capital requirements under existing rules and those produced by Basel II while institutions remain subject to the current rules. Beyond the parallel run, the agencies have proposed a three-year transitional floor period, more stringent than that in the 2004 Basel II framework, to prevent an unwarranted decline in capital levels. In addition, current supervisory safeguards, such as the existing leverage ratio and prompt corrective action, will continue to provide an important backstop against a potential unwarranted decline in bank capital levels. In general, if we at the Federal Reserve see that the U.S. Basel II proposals are not working as intended, we will seek modifications to them.  BIS Review 84/2006 3 
Proposals to amend existing Basel I rules At this point, I would like to say just a few words about ongoing efforts to revise the existing Basel I regulatory capital rules for non-Basel II institutions. We expect only one or two dozen institutions to move to the U.S. version of Basel II in the near term, meaning that the vast majority of U.S. institutions will continue to operate under Basel I-based rules, which we intend to amend through a separate rulemaking process. The U.S. Basel I framework has already been amended more than twenty-five times since its introduction in response to changes in banking products and the banking environment and as a result of a better understanding of the risks of individual products and services. The agencies believe that now is another appropriate time to propose modifications to our Basel I rules. The agencies have issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) discussing possible changes to increase the risk sensitivity of the U.S. Basel I rules and to mitigate competitive distortions that might be created by introducing Basel II. We are now reviewing comments on the ANPR and working on a notice of proposed rulemaking. We are mindful that amendments to the Basel I rules should not be too complex or too burdensome for the large number of small- and mid-sized institutions to which the revised rules might apply. Indeed, a number of those commenting on the ANPR advocated leaving existing rules unchanged. With regard to both the Basel II proposals and the proposed Basel I amendments, we understand the need for full transparency. For that reason, we expect to have overlapping comment periods for the Basel II NPR and the NPR for the proposed Basel I amendments. In fact, we want all interested parties to compare, contrast, and comment on the two proposals in overlapping timeframes. Accordingly, either of our proposals could change as a result of comments received or new information gathered.  Conclusion From the Federal Reserve's perspective, the forthcoming publication of interagency proposals relating to Basel II is a very positive development and demonstrates the ability of the agencies to work cooperatively to modernize our regulatory capital framework. The Federal Reserve's commitment to the Basel II process remains as strong as ever, even as we recognize that the proposals remain subject to further comment and that there is likely much more work to be done. We encourage comments from all interested parties and will give them careful consideration. I would like to emphasize the Federal Reserve desires to ensure that the final rule for Basel II is a substantial enhancement over existing Basel I rules, appropriately capturing the risks of our largest, most complex banks, and encouraging continual improvement in risk-measurement and -management systems. We look forward to working with the other agencies as we enter into the final rule phase of the Basel II process. We recognize that many institutions have been diligently preparing for Basel II implementation and we understand our obligation, as supervisors, to support institutions wanting to adopt Basel II at the first available date. We suggest that those institutions continue to move forward with implementation planning, including identification of gaps in their own preparation.  Finally, I would like to assure the Subcommittee members that we at the Federal Reserve are pursuing Basel II because we believe it will help to preserve the safety and soundness of our nation's banking system. In our dual role as central bank and supervisor of banks, bank holding companies, and financial holding companies, the Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring that the Basel II framework delivers a strong and risk-sensitive base of capital for our largest and most complex banking institutions. That is why we stand behind the additional safeguards contained in the Basel II NPR to ensure strong capital levels during the transition to the new framework. We will remain vigilant, on an ongoing basis, in monitoring and assessing the impact of Basel II on both individual and aggregate minimum regulatory capital requirements and in employing rigorous and thorough analysis to support our evaluation. By so doing, we believe that the proposals being discussed today can be implemented responsibly and in a safe and sound manner.  Proposed interagency guidance on commercial real estate concentration risk The four federal bank and thrift regulatory agencies issued joint proposed guidance in January 2006 on the sound risk management of commercial real estate concentrations. The comment period closed in April. The proposed guidance generated significant interest. The Federal Reserve received more than 1,600 comment letters on the proposed guidance. Typically, the comments raised concerns about 4 BIS Review 84/2006 
the intent and purpose of the proposed guidance. Over the past few months, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have been reviewing these comments carefully and have met with industry trade groups and individual bankers.  In my testimony today, I would like to provide some perspective on why the agencies are concerned about CRE concentrations and the risks they may pose, and why we saw the need to issue the proposed guidance. I will also address the intent of the proposed guidance and some misconceptions that have arisen. First, I would like to explain how we define commercial real estate. For purposes of this guidance, CRE loans include land development and construction loans (both commercial and 1- to-4 family residential construction) and loans secured by raw land, multi-family property, or nonfarm nonresidential property where the primary or a significant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property or the proceeds of the sale, refinancing, or permanent financing of the property. The proposed guidance does not apply to owner-occupied CRE loans where the majority of repayment comes from income from the borrower's business operations.  Over the past dozen years, the agencies have observed a material rise in CRE concentrations at many banks. For small- to medium-sized banks, in particular, the growth in CRE concentrations has been significant. This growth in CRE concentrations is understandable as community-based banks have experienced increasing competitive pressure from larger banks and other financial services institutions in other lending areas. We recognize that asset concentrations can, on a practical basis, be difficult to avoid due to an institution's marketplace, area of expertise, or competitive environment. However, as experience has amply demonstrated, large and growing asset concentrations such as we are seeing today in some banks can adversely affect banks' earnings and capital, and indeed banks' safety and soundness, if not properly managed. For that reason, prudent banks have long understood the importance of managing credit concentration risks - it is one of the basic tenets of banking that the Federal Reserve has long emphasized. So what exactly are concentrations of credit and what risks do they pose to institutions? Concentrations of credit are generally defined as groups or classes of loans or other credit exposures that share common risk characteristics or sensitivity to adverse economic, financial or business developments. For a given concentration, when weaknesses develop in a common risk factor or factors, loans within that concentration may be adversely affected, even if every individual loan has been underwritten prudently. As bank supervisors, we have seen the dangers of credit concentrations in previous CRE credit cycles. Let me provide you with some details on the trend we have observed. CRE concentrations have almost doubled between 1992 and 2005 for all commercial and savings banks with assets between $100 million and $10 billion. During this period, for those banks with assets between $100 million and $1 billion, CRE concentrations rose from 160 percent to 294 percent of capital, while for those with assets between $1 billion and $10 billion, CRE concentrations rose from 143 percent to 266 percent of capital. Why are the agencies focusing on CRE concentration risk? The agencies are concerned that the high CRE concentrations would make institutions more vulnerable to adverse changes in CRE markets. CRE markets tend to be among the most cyclical, prone to boom and bust economic cycles. This is because a poorly underwritten project or overbuilding in a market can have significant negative effects on CRE loans that are soundly underwritten. To increase occupancy rates, weaker projects may lower rents and provide more generous terms to attract tenants. This in turn can reduce cash flow to stronger properties and put those credits at risk. As you know, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, concentrations in CRE lending, coupled with weak underwriting and depressed CRE markets, contributed to large credit losses at some banks, significant numbers of bank failures, and financial stress at many other banks. After recovering from the severe credit losses of that CRE downturn, most U.S. CRE markets have enjoyed very benign conditions. But investment in CRE is again growing strongly, and we expect banks to assess the vulnerabilities of their portfolios to loss in expectation of the next downturn. Compounding our concern about rising CRE concentrations is feedback from our examiners that some institutions' risk-management practices have not kept pace with the growth in their CRE concentrations. Supervisory staff have found weaknesses in fundamental risk-management areas such as board and management oversight, risk assessment, and monitoring. In addition, examiners BIS Review 84/2006 5 
have observed that institutions have not always sufficiently addressed CRE concentration risk in their strategic and capital planning. We are also carefully monitoring underwriting standards. While the U.S. CRE market is generally performing well, underwriting terms and conditions have been softening over the past couple of years, albeit not to the extent seen in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Loosening loan covenants, expanding interest-only periods, and extending amortizations are some examples of the weakening underwriting terms that we are currently observing. Capitalization rates of CRE projects - which measure the expected investor return on real estate investments - are also near historical lows, which raises concerns about collateral values and loan-to-value ratios in the event capitalization rates should return to historical mean levels. Many bankers have argued that the agencies already have the supervisory tools available to address concerns about concentrations at individual banks and that the guidance would add unnecessary regulatory burden. Our current real estate lending guidelines were issued in 1993 under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. The issuance of guidance to banks and examiners is one of our most important supervisory tools for focusing attention on emerging risk issues before they become larger problems and for articulating supervisory expectations to our institutions. Given the rising concentration levels, and the current stage of this CRE cycle, we believe that there is now a need for additional CRE guidance to reinforce and build upon our existing guidance and to ensure a consistent supervisory approach.  It is important to stress that the intent of the proposed guidance is not to restrict CRE lending but rather to provide a framework for a safe and sound CRE lending program. The agencies recognize that financial institutions play a vital role in providing credit to their communities. The main message in the proposed guidance is that banking institutions need to identify and manage credit-concentration risks appropriately. Under the proposed guidance, we would expect banks to strengthen their management practices as their concentration risks grow. The proposed guidance sets forth risk management practices that are well within the capabilities of many institutions and, in fact, a number of institutions already have many of these practices in place.  Not surprisingly, the establishment of explicit thresholds in the proposal has generated significant controversy. Bankers have argued that the thresholds are arbitrary and will be viewed as hard lending limits by examiners and the industry. I want to re-emphasize that the agencies' intent in proposing these thresholds was not to limit an institution's CRE lending but to ensure that risk-management practices are commensurate with this activity. Rather, the thresholds should be viewed as supervisory screens that examiners should use to identify banks with potential CRE concentration risk. Examiners would expect organizations to strengthen their portfolio risk management as CRE concentrations grow. Institutions are expected to conduct their own analyses of CRE concentration risk and establish their own concentration limits. Institutions, after all, are in the best position to identify and understand their concentration risk. Another significant concern expressed in the comment letters by bankers is that the proposed guidance will be implemented in an inconsistent manner, creating an uneven playing field with some banks facing higher supervisory expectations. Issuing the guidance on an interagency basis should encourage a consistent supervisory approach. Further, the agencies are also developing interagency training materials about the new guidance for their examiners to support more effective and consistent implementation. Another concern expressed by bankers is that examiners will take a "one-size-fits-all" supervisory approach and will not consider a bank's specific portfolio characteristics and risk-management practices when applying the guidance. The supervisory evaluation of institutions' CRE concentration risk would always be conducted on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the institution's own analysis of its CRE concentration risk. The diversity of an institution's CRE portfolio, the effectiveness of an institution's risk-management practices, and the presence of any other factors that mitigate its risks would be key considerations in the supervisory evaluation of the level of an institution's CRE concentration risk. Bankers in their comments also have expressed concern about how examiners will evaluate capital adequacy for banks with a CRE concentration. The proposed guidance addresses capital adequacy in a principles-based manner, noting that institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all their risk, including their concentration risk. This message is entirely consistent with 6 BIS Review 84/2006 
the agencies' existing capital adequacy guidelines. In evaluating capital adequacy, the agencies will consider, for example, the level and nature of inherent risk in an institution's CRE portfolio as well as management expertise, historical performance, underwriting standards, risk-management practices, market conditions, and any loan loss reserves allocated for CRE concentration risk. Moreover, the quality of institutions' risk-management practices will be a significant consideration in the evaluation of capital adequacy. Our concerns about capital adequacy will be reduced if an institution has strong risk-management practices. On the other hand, if an institution has inadequate risk management and no prospects for near-term improvement, there could be a concern that the institution may not have sufficient capital to serve as a buffer against unexpected losses from CRE concentrations.  Finally, bankers' comments have expressed concerns about how the issuance of the proposed guidance might affect the availability of CRE credit. The proposed CRE concentration guidance is not intended to limit or discourage institutions' CRE lending. We recognize that such lending is an important business activity for banks. We also believe that CRE concentration risk can be safely managed. In that regard, the proposed guidance is simply intended to reinforce and build upon existing guidance on risk-management practices for addressing the risks arising from concentrations in CRE lending. In conclusion, although it is sometimes an unpopular strategy when loan performance is good, we believe that it is far more prudent, and indeed our responsibility, to work proactively to address small but emerging issues to help prevent their evolution into larger problems for the banking industry and the economy as a whole. That is why we feel it is important to issue this guidance at this time.  Thank you very much for your attention. I welcome any comments you may have and will be happy to answer any questions.

Erkki Liikanen: Finland – “a land in between” but at the heart of Europe Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the dinner of informal Ecofin, Helsinki, 8 September 2006.  *      *      * Ministers, colleagues,  Dear friends,  This is the second time when European leaders are dining in this house.  The first time was in spring 1953, when Robert Schuman, the father of the European Coal and Steel Community and former French prime minister, was received here for a dinner. The host was the colourful and controversial cabinet minister, Väinö Leskinen.  Schuman had been invited to Finland by the Foreign Trade Association as a guest speaker. His visit created a strong negative reaction from the Soviet Union. A week later Pravda wrote that the visit was undeniably connected with discussions against stepping up trade between Finland and the Soviet Union. In this climate, the Government did not want to devote any official attention to Robert Schuman.  President Paasikivi, however, received him and wrote in his memoirs: "I explained my own view and the position of Finland. He understood it well. Schuman is indeed an intelligent and charming man".  Today, this episode seems to have been long ago. Europe was divided into two hostile blocks. Finland followed European construction from a distance, if at all.  The destiny of this country has always been linked to the relations between great powers. We have been "a land in between".  Also culturally, Finland shows many influences. We have got much through Stockholm, and from famous German university towns. Architecturally, the neo-classic centre of Helsinki resembles St. Petersburg.  As a political entity, Finland emerged as a result of the Peace Treaty of Tilsit, in 1807. Napoleon encouraged the Russian emperor to conquer Finland from Sweden. Alexander I succeeded and established the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland , where he ruled as constitutional monarch – although he remained an autocrat in Russia.  Important institutions of this country were developed during the autonomy, long before independence.  For example, the Bank of Finland was established in 1811. It is the fourth oldest central bank. Finland obtained its own monetary system in 1860. It was seen as a means of integrating the country's monetary system with the European monies. The currency, markka, was defined as being equal to the French franc in metallic content.  The construction of this community hall was begun in 1906 by the Helsinki Workers' Association. In the same year, Finland became the first country in Europe to grant universal suffrage to all women and men.  Finland became independent in 1917. Independence was followed by three months of tragic civil war. However, the democratic institutions survived and did not cease to function, even during the Second World War.  This building has played a role in many events in our political history. It was severely damaged during the civil war, because it served as headquarters of the insurgent reds. Later, landmark meetings took place here in the struggle between the Social Democrats and the Communists over control of trade unions.  Now this wonderful art nouveau house is a major conference centre, where dinner is served by a French multinational company. Quite symbolic. And this even before the proposal for the services directive!  The second Finnish presidency takes place at a time when many say that Europe is in a crisis, due to the rejection of the constitutional treaty in two referenda.  BIS Review 83/2006 1 
Let us put things into perspective. Only two years ago ten new countries joined the EU. And only four years ago euro notes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 member states.  These are remarkable historic achievements. So crisis, what crisis?  But of course, there is a lot of work ahead of us. Our challenge is to revitalize the European economy. We should not allow the current recovery to make us forget that reforming product and labour markets is vital to increasing our growth potential.  Europe needs to increase productivity growth and to be better in innovation.  The integration of financial markets can have significant positive effects on employment and growth. It can also reinforce the resilience of the European economy by sharing risks between regions.  An integrated financial market needs a modern payments system. Therefore, the Single Euro Payment Area project deserves our full support.  And we need a truly unified securities market without excessive costs for cross-border trading. We should therefore remove any obstacles to its consolidation and streamlining.  Our financial supervision structure is also too fragmented.  EU has often been criticized for over-regulation. Actually the existence of 25 different sets of regulations with 25 different administrative and supervisory practices can be the worst kind of over-regulation.  Dear friends  During the war, Jean Monnet often repeated that there could be no peace in Europe, if the nation states continued to be structured around the sort of sovereignty that leads to politics of national privilege and economic protectionism.  Coincidentally, J.K. Paasikivi, our post-war president also wrote during the war that the limitation of raison d’état is the question upon which hinges the future of not only small states, but also the large states, and humanity as a whole.  Ultimately, Monnet and Paasikivi were talking about the same thing.  What is most essential in the EU? It is that the guiding principle is law, not force. Legitimacy and the rule of law govern relations between member states.  The task of the European institutions is to monitor legality and compliance of all activities with the EU treaties.  Finally, taking into account the history of Finland, a small country, so often shaken by the storms of our continent, it is no surprise that Finnish European policies have from the very first day been community-oriented and that it supports strong common institutions.  Thank you.  2 BIS Review 83/2006 
Paul Jenkins: Weathering economic shocks – the importance of flexibility Remarks by Mr Paul Jenkins, Senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Vancouver Board of Trade, Vancouver, BC, 13 September 2006. *      *      * Today, I would like to talk about the importance of flexibility to economic adjustment and, hence, about the need to adopt economic policies that promote flexibility in markets for goods, services, capital, and labour. I am particularly pleased to be discussing this issue here in British Columbia where adjustment to changing global and domestic economic developments has been front and centre in the management of your economy. First, I should explain what I mean by flexibility. As most of you are surely aware, the Bank of Canada has been openly discussing the importance of promoting policies that support economic efficiency, including financial system efficiency. Efficiency refers to the allocation of scarce economic resources to the most productive uses, in a cost-effective way. Flexibility refers to the ability of an economy to adjust to changing circumstances. When economic conditions change, this typically causes movements in relative prices that send important signals to markets. A flexible economy is one that adjusts to these signals and returns to its production potential as quickly, and with as little cost, as possible. Economic flexibility is what I wish to focus on today. Why flexibility is so important Over the past several years, economic expansion in Canada and around the world has been robust. And, as we look ahead, prospects remain generally upbeat. In some respects, what we have witnessed in terms of economic performance is unprecedented, especially since it has been attained in the face of major global and country-specific shocks that, in the past, would have caused great difficulty and threatened to derail the expansion. This was certainly the case in Canada before the mid-1990s when the economy had a hard time dealing with economic and financial shocks. The boom-bust cycles of the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s stand out as clear evidence that we did not have our domestic house in order. The final straw was the extent to which the Canadian economy got caught up in the backwash of the 1994-95 Mexican peso crisis because of our high and unsustainable levels of public debt at that time. Indeed, the year 1995 proved to be a watershed. By then, the Bank had succeeded in reducing inflation and anchoring short-term inflation expectations to the 2 per cent target. The federal budget deficit began to shrink significantly in 1995, and by the 1997/98 fiscal year, it had moved into a surplus position. Other structural policies, including tax reform and free trade, were also beginning to pay dividends. Canada's economic record over the past decade stands in stark contrast to this earlier period. Output and employment have continued to grow steadily since the mid-1990s, even as our economy has been buffeted by a series of significant shocks. Let me recall some of those shocks. They started with the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, which then spread to Russia and Latin America. This series of events in emerging-market economies led to a sharp decline in world demand and commodity prices and, hence, to a marked depreciation of the Canadian dollar. Next came the worldwide collapse of the high-tech bubble. It, too, depressed foreign demand for Canadian goods and services, as did the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. On a relatively smaller scale, since the beginning of this century, the Canadian economy has had to contend with other domestic calamities that also had an international dimension to them. I'm referring, of course, to SARS and BSE. More recently, we have had to face intensified competition from major new global players, notably China and India. And, since 2003, we have experienced a sharp appreciation of our currency, which primarily reflects strong world demand and high prices for the energy and other commodities we produce. What have been some of the key characteristics of these shocks? BIS Review 83/2006 1 
The Asian crisis of 1997-98 and the circumstances we have been experiencing since 2003 have involved large movements in relative prices. By this I mean sharp movements in the prices of energy and non-energy commodities (relative to the prices of other goods we produce) and in the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar. These movements have triggered important shifts in economic activity and reallocations of production resources across sectors and regions of our economy. Following the Asian crisis, we saw a shift out of commodities and into manufacturing. Now we see a shift in the opposite direction. And the current intense competition from Asia is clearly evident in reduced prices for manufactured consumer goods. Adjusting to these shocks has not been easy – indeed, for many firms and their workers it has been downright painful. Still, as I said earlier, total output and employment have continued to grow at a good clip over the past decade - averaging 3 and 2 per cent a year, respectively. Furthermore, during the current episode of marked movements in relative prices, there has been broad-based economic growth across all Canadian regions.  Canada is not the only economy that has coped better with recent shocks. To varying degrees, other countries have as well - which partly explains why world economic growth has held up better this time around. Clearly, many national economies have been able to respond more flexibly than in the past to unexpected developments. And this has helped to mitigate the impact of shocks, advance the adjustment, and support continued strong economic performance.  This increased flexibility has been the product of economic policies and structural reforms that many countries, including Canada, have undertaken over the years to strengthen their economies and make them more resilient to shocks.  But this does not mean that we have nothing to worry about as we look ahead. We live in an era of rapid change, and we operate in a global environment that is constantly shifting. Uncertainty, risks, and shocks are a constant feature of the economic landscape. For Canada, this is particularly relevant given how open our economy is to international trade and capital flows. At the Bank of Canada, we believe that world economic prospects remain favourable as we look out over the medium term. But while this reflects our central expectation of how the world will unfold, there are important upside and downside risks around this scenario. On the downside, persistent global imbalances immediately come to mind, as does the lack of success in the Doha round of trade talks. These risks could result in significantly slower global economic growth. At the same time, we cannot rule out the possibility of stronger growth, especially in Asia. Of course, we know that events can turn out very differently from our expectations today. So we must plan accordingly. In terms of potential risks and sudden developments, the best approach is to constantly ask ourselves what steps we can take to make our economy and domestic markets more flexible and thus better able to adapt. And we need to recognize that the pursuit of such an approach is a shared responsibility among firms, workers, and policy-makers. Firms and their workers need to be able to respond quickly to technological advances and to various shocks that require significant changes in the way they conduct business, the type of goods and services they produce, and the markets they choose to develop. A well-functioning market-based economy and clear relative price signals are critical in this context. At the same time, policy-makers need to be wary of barriers to adjustment, such as labour regulations that inhibit the movement of workers from one type of job, or from one sector or region, to another. Some of these issues are particularly relevant in a Canadian context, and I will return to them later.  The key point I want to make here is that economic policies and structural reforms that enhance flexibility make it easier to withstand shocks and to make adjustments. And this helps to maintain output at the economy's production potential. Put differently, strong, well-functioning domestic markets for goods, services, capital, and labour are essential to the economic well-being of Canadians.  In addition, with national economies so closely connected these days, actions by individual countries to increase flexibility translate into an even greater cumulative benefit for the world economy. Indeed, the greater the number of economies that are flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances, the stronger and more sustainable world economic growth will be. So what are the policies that promote flexibility and thus position us to take advantage of the opportunities offered by globalization and to cope with unforeseen shocks that are sure to come our way? 2 BIS Review 83/2006 
Policies that promote economic flexibility  In Canada – and in many other countries – better macroeconomic management has been instrumental to the good economic performance of recent years.  Specifically, a monetary policy focused on low, stable, and predictable inflation has helped Canadian businesses read price signals more clearly, respond to relative price changes more promptly, and generally allocate production resources more efficiently. And this, together with the Bank of Canada's symmetric response to deviations from the 2 per cent inflation target has contributed to solid and more stable economic growth over the past decade. A floating exchange rate - which is the other key component of our monetary policy framework – has also provided an important stabilization mechanism for the Canadian economy. Movements of the exchange rate provide clear price signals that help speed up adjustment to shocks with lower overall economic costs than if the exchange rate did not move. With a fixed exchange rate, it takes longer for price signals to be recognized, and the adjustment primarily takes place through changes in domestic prices and wages, at the cost of significant variability in output and employment. It is also important to recognize that it is simply not possible for a central bank to successfully control both the domestic and external values of its currency at the same time. We have only one instrument – our policy interest rate – and so we can have only one target. Thus, with inflation as our target, we naturally operate with a floating currency. A sound fiscal policy, focused on reducing public sector debt levels relative to the size of the economy, has also contributed significantly to economic stabilization. It gives governments flexibility to respond to evolving circumstances and unexpected developments. They can do this by letting automatic fiscal stabilizers work to help sustain the overall level of demand when the economy is weak or to relieve demand pressures when the economy is booming. We also know from bitter experience, especially through the late 1980s, that economic outcomes are better and adjustments less costly when macroeconomic policies are working in tandem. In this regard, given the current strength of domestic demand in Canada and the high level of resource utilization, governments need to guard against adding to any excess demand pressures. Despite considerable progress in Canada and elsewhere in maintaining macroeconomic stability, the growing integration of the world economy has made it clear that this is not enough. To enhance flexibility, raise the economy's growth potential, and increase resilience to shocks, we also need structural reforms. For Canada, structural reform has a broad context, with many priorities across a number of jurisdictions. I'll mention a couple that I consider to be particularly relevant. The financial system, with its vital role in supporting a healthy modern economy, has been and will continue to be a top priority. Here, the ultimate goal should be an innovative, efficient, and sound financial system that can provide specialized financing services competitively. Such a system enhances overall economic flexibility by helping to redirect capital and resources to the most productive uses, in a cost-effective way, following a shock. Removing internal barriers to the free movement of goods, services, and labour is another priority. This is an area that is rightly attracting renewed attention, as differences in regional economic performance and shortages of skilled labour are becoming more pronounced, and as demographic challenges begin to intensify. A number of initiatives to remove internal barriers have been undertaken over the years - but with mixed and generally modest results. Here, I'm thinking of the "Red Seal" program, which was introduced 45 years ago to help standardize and recognize workers' trade qualifications. I'm also thinking of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), which was signed by First Ministers in 1994 and was aimed at reducing barriers to the movement of goods, services, investment, and labour.  More recently, we have seen some progress in areas such as procurement practices, enforcement and dispute resolution, and licensing and residency requirements for employment. One recent example is the accord reached this past April between British Columbia and Alberta to strengthen enforcement and dispute resolution, and to harmonize labour credentials and business regulations and standards by early 2009. Another example is the agreement, earlier this year, between Ontario and Quebec to allow some further, albeit limited, movement of construction workers between the two provinces. Earlier this month, two temporary "foreign-worker units" started operating in Vancouver and BIS Review 83/2006 3 
Calgary to facilitate the entry of skilled foreign workers into Canada. And just last week, the Committee of Ministers Responsible for Internal Trade agreed on an action plan that embraces efforts across a range of internal trade issues.  All this is encouraging because considerably more needs to be done to enhance the flexibility and functioning of our internal markets from coast to coast. Business regulations and standards, including those for the financial sector, need to be harmonized across Canada. Dispute resolution and enforcement under the AIT need to be strengthened. And, to make our labour markets more flexible, trades and professional designations should be recognized and fully transferable across the country. Based on a recent survey, more than one-third of all workers and about half of all foreign-trained workers still have problems getting their credentials recognized across Canadian jurisdictions.1  How flexible is the Canadian economy? The good news is that, despite the challenges that we still face, overall, our economy fares well in international comparisons of flexibility and adaptability. In a 2005 study, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded that "Canada is characterized by a relatively high degree of flexibility, of a magnitude comparable if not larger than many other industrialized countries, with the likely exception of the United States."2  For purposes of this study, the IMF looked at different indicators of economic flexibility – with uniform results. For example, the reallocation of production resources across sectors, in response to changing economic conditions over the 1980-2000 period, was quite high in Canada compared with other major industrialized countries (except the United States) - indicating a high degree of economic flexibility. The IMF also compared rates of firm turnover, and of job creation and destruction, across countries. Both of these measures were relatively high for Canada - again suggesting a high degree of flexibility.  Other measures of the way in which our economy responds to macroeconomic disturbances also point in the same direction. As of the first quarter of 2006, interprovincial migration has shown a marked increase over the past two years to 333,000 individuals, representing over one per cent of the total Canadian population. Not surprisingly, the two provinces with a net positive inflow over this period are Alberta and British Columbia. And a more recent study by the IMF that focused on Canadian labour markets concluded that, overall, they are relatively flexible.3  So Canada does seem to rate high according to some measures of flexibility. But the challenge is to continue to promote flexibility in all of our domestic markets - for goods, services, capital, and labour. Continuous improvement is essential. Given the openness of the Canadian economy, we cannot be complacent. Recent economic and financial developments Before concluding, let me summarize the Bank's current thinking on the economy, as we laid it out last week in the press release announcing our decision to leave the target for the overnight rate unchanged at 4 1/4 per cent.  Basically, we noted that the global economy has continued to expand solidly, with some moderation in U.S. economic growth but with some further strengthening in the rest of the world. Against this backdrop, commodity prices have remained firm. In Canada, the level of economic activity in the second quarter of 2006 was somewhat below the Bank's expectations, primarily because of weaker exports. Total and core CPI inflation came in slightly higher than expected in July, mainly because of price strength in the housing and services sectors. Nevertheless, all things considered - and here I would include the most recent labour force numbers -                                                       1  Forum of Labour Market Ministers. 2005. "Report of Survey Results: Inter-provincial labour mobility in Canada 2004/05." 2  See IMF (2005) "How Flexible Is the Canadian Economy? An International Comparison," in Canada: Selected Issues (Article IV Consultation): 92-100. 3  See T. Bayoumi, B. Sutton, and A. Swiston, "Shocking Aspects of Canadian Labor Markets" (IMF Working Paper No. 83, March 2006). 4 BIS Review 83/2006 
the underlying trends in the economy appear to be in line with the broad thrust of our projection for output and inflation in the July Monetary Policy Report Update. We continue to expect that the economy will operate at about capacity through 2008, with total CPI inflation returning to the 2 per cent inflation target in the second half of 2007. In line with this outlook, the current level of the target for the overnight rate is judged at this time to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. The key risks to the Canadian outlook for output and inflation over the next few quarters remain those set out in our July Report: on the upside, they relate primarily to the momentum in household spending and housing prices; on the downside, U.S. household demand could slow more rapidly than expected, thus reducing demand for Canadian exports. While both these risks appear to be a little greater than they were in July, we continue to judge that, overall, risks are roughly balanced. We will provide a full analysis of economic developments, trends, and risks in our next Monetary Policy Report, which will be published on 19 October 2006. Concluding thoughts  Let me now conclude. As a nation, we are clearly learning from experience and adapting to change. Over the past decade, we have done much to implement sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that have helped our economy become more flexible and thus more adaptable to change. Canada's strong economic performance in the face of major disturbances over this period attests to the importance of flexibility. However, our success to date does not mean that we can rest on our oars. Uncertainty, risks, and shocks will be as much a part of tomorrow's economic picture as they have been of yesterday's and today's. We all have a role to play in moving the Canadian economy to the forefront, in terms of flexibility and adaptability. The Bank of Canada is committed to doing its part.  BIS Review 83/2006 5 
Erkki Liikanen: Internal migration in Europe Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the Conference by the Economic Council of Finland and the European Economic and Social Committee, Helsinki, 4-5 September 2006.  *      *      * Monetary policy has no direct connection to labour mobility, whether occupational or geographical, but important links can be found. According to the so-called 'optimal currency area' theory, factors of production – labour included – should in principle move flexibly within the euro area.  This is not the case, even though there are no formal limits on migration within the euro area. Rigidities of mobility manifest themselves in varying degrees of unemployment in EU countries.  When talking about internal migration in Europe, and especially within the EU, it is important to bear in mind that it is a part of a much greater, global reallocation of labour and capital.  Following the opening up of the international economy, developed countries have been compelled to confront the strong expansion of a proportion of labour in the world economy. Work is flowing even from the new member states to countries where wages are lower. Labour is also moving to countries where wages are higher.  Following these changes, productivity in the world economy will improve, and wages and prices increases slow down in developed countries. This development has supported low level of interest rates.  The enlargement of the EU has resulted in a higher proportional increase in labour than in capital in the EU. Yet, compared to the global change, the shift in the EU's internal production factors has been very small.  Although internal migration of labour and capital within the EU has attracted a great deal of attention – at times passionate one – its advantages and disadvantages seem to remain much weaker than initially thought. A massive flow of migration from the new member states to the old has not materialised.  Although Europe's internal migration of labour and capital shares common features with global problems, important differences can also be found.  As to intra-European migration, a positive difference relative to the global situation is the fact that the general level of education in both old and new member states is more or less the same. This naturally facilitates and speeds up integration of economies significantly and is likely to reduce the need for labour migration.  The high level of education in new member states has accelerated the shifting of functions requiring highly qualified personnel, such as IT functions, to new member states. The level of pay of highly educated labour has increased in new member states, while in the old member states the growth rate of comparable salaries has slowed down. The purchasing-power-adjusted difference in the standard of living has narrowed down.  In some professional groups, however, such as doctors and nurses – who in earlier communist times were notoriously badly paid – emigration has been wide, causing substantial problems to the countries which have been drained of employees in these professional groups.  It is nevertheless evident that the majority of people prefer to remain in their home lands. The need for labour to migrate will decrease if capital moves towards labour. This has, in fact, happened broadly throughout Europe.  Differences between global developments and the EU's internal development can also be found in capital flows. Developments within the EU have followed the 'normal theory', investment has flowed from wealthy economies to economies with a low capital stock. In contrast, global developments have taken the opposite direction: investment has flowed from developed and from not so developed economies with surplus to the United States. This has been the cause of a major debate.  Investment flows to new member states are generally reflected in large current account deficits in these economies. These imbalances in financing conditions must be taken into account in economic policies and at central banks. A large current account deficit is often a serious problem, but not always. BIS Review 82/2006 1 
If the deficit is financed through a stable and long-term arrangement and the funds are directed in effective real investment, a large current account deficit is an indication of the strength of the economy, rather than of its weakness.  By and large, deficit financing in the new member states is quite reliable. Arrangements such as internal financing in international corporations have already been experienced.  Yet, the rate of indebtedness of some countries raises certain doubts.  It can be taken as a positive development that the primary reason for the transfer of investment capital does not seem to be only the member states' cheaper labour, but largely companies' desire to establish their presence in new member states' rapidly growing markets and to diversify their supply chain.  Although capital flows in the EU are free from currency regulation, flexible movement of capital even within the euro area is not fully effective. European financial market integration is still not complete. Many surveys show that higher depth and liquidity and improving the efficiency of payment transfers and the securities markets would make a substantial contribution to transforming the structures of the economy.   Movement of labour is complicated by a number of problems. It is difficult for individual people with poor language skills to move to a foreign country and take up jobs that are below their qualifications. Countries that lose labour, are deprived of an active labour force, and pressures can aggravate differences in salaries. In the receiving countries, in contrast, employees often reject newcomers as competitors that are willing to work for considerably lower pay.  Long-term advantages may nevertheless greatly benefit all parties. Economic growth in the receiving country accelerates and over time, the salary levels of old employees in the competed sectors also increase.  An important factor in the present migration movement is also that the emigrants are more likely to return home than earlier. Recent evaluations show that nowadays most emigrants will eventually return home, bringing with them improved skills and accumulated wealth, with which they facilitate economic development in their home region.  It is evident that a broad migration in both directions will significantly contribute to improvements in productivity and economic activity within the EU. It will improve the level of education, the transfer of know-how from country to country and networking. These matters must be taken seriously and must be emphasised, even when faced with the problems associated with migration.  For the sake of balance it is, of course, important to aim at relatively modest net migration flows. It is evident, for example, that population ageing will affect all EU countries; it is unlikely that any of them will be able to handle the challenge primarily by attracting young population from other EU countries.   Migration is – and of course has to be – primarily market-driven. To the extent that changes in the production structure seem unavoidable, they should not be retarded through economic policy; rather, support should be provided in the event of problems caused by these changes. Problems in the transition period must also be acknowledged, but the advantages generated as a result of the changes should be emphasised.  Member states and the European Commission have already provided wide support to the free movement of labour by removing obstacles that limit migration and introducing active measures that facilitate migration. Support should be channelled to workers rather than work places. Re-education as well as occupational and geographical support and security in connection with migration are key measures that governments should take in order to facilitate the reallocation of labour force.  The ECB and other central banks within the EU can enhance the regional and professional allocation of labour force by improving the integration and efficiency of financing markets and payment systems throughout the area. This development work must naturally be shared by governments.  To conclude, there still remains much to be done to improve the situation.  2 BIS Review 82/2006 
Y V Reddy: Credit counselling - an Indian perspective Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Foundation Day Function of the Bank of India, Mumbai, 7 September 2006. *      *      * Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests and friends, I am thankful to Mr. Balachandran for providing this opportunity to be with this eminent gathering assembled for a noble cause. Bank of India has been among the banks known to be a pioneer in several areas of commercial banking. In this context, the initiative by the bank to establish credit counselling centers on a pilot basis highlights the pro-active role being played by our banks. In fact, a major reason for my agreeing to participate in this ceremony is to demonstrate the Reserve Bank of India's commitment to the cause of credit counselling - a recent initiative in our country.  In my remarks on this occasion, some introduction on the importance of this topic would be in order. An overview of the global practice in this area could then be followed by a discussion of the Indian context with regard to credit counselling. Any mechanism of credit counselling has to reckon with the processes, costs and benefits. The concluding thoughts are in the nature of illustrative issues towards initiating and popularising credit counselling in India.  Introduction With the changing growth dynamics of the economy, it is not difficult to envisage situations where certain segments of the population become susceptible to excessive borrower optimism or even to vicissitudes in the economic environment. Such susceptibility could also arise from unforeseen shocks or emergencies that make repayment difficult. By providing sound advice to arrest the deterioration of incomes and restructure their debt, credit counselling offers a meaningful solution for borrowers to gradually overcome their debt burden and improve their money management skills. In this regard, the question is whether there is a role for public policy in matters relating to credit counselling?  We must recognise that financial intermediaries, the corporates and high net worth individuals generally possess in-house knowledge of matters relating to financial management and can afford to employ outside expertise as appropriate in regard to their investment decision and management of distressed loans. Public Policy has enabled an operational mechanism in the form of Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR) in regard to loans by banks and development financial institutions to large corporates. Somewhat similar framework has also been provided to small and medium enterprise. In regard to agricultural loans and most of the small borrowers, however, only broad guidelines are issued to banks from time to time on parameters for restructuring. The extent of active interaction between individual borrowers and banks is, therefore, not clear.  It is increasingly felt that individuals are not in a position to take full advantage of the guidelines issued to the banks for variety of reasons. These may include inadequacies in managing their finances especially delinquent accounts. Further, individuals may not be able to articulate their financial situation adequately to the banks. It will be in the interest of the banks themselves to help individual borrowers through appropriate credit counselling. Public policy could, therefore, have an advisory role in encouraging mechanisms in the form of credit counselling in regard to individuals. There are a variety of ways in which this has been accomplished in different countries, but in India we are just beginning to address the situation. Some urgency has been lent to this issue in India in view of rapid growth in consumer loans, housing loans and the more recent emphasis on financial inclusion. It is interesting to note that the terms of reference of the Financial Inclusion Task Force initiated by the Treasury of the United Kingdom to consider solutions to the problem of financial exclusion identifies three key areas. This includes face-to-face money advice in addition to access to banking and access to affordable credit. Global practice The first well-known credit counselling agencies were created in 1951 in the United States when credit grantors created the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC). Their stated objective was to BIS Review 82/2006 1 
promote financial literacy and help consumers to avoid bankruptcy. Credit counselling, however, came into its own as a result of the passing of the Housing and Urban Development Act in 1968. Under this Act, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development was allowed to authorize public and private organizations to provide counselling to mortgagors. The resulting services and infrastructure to provide them led to the development of the credit counselling industry.  In 1993, the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies (AICCCA) was founded in the United States, citing a need for industry-wide standards of excellence and ethical conduct. This formally organized the NFCC’s competition. The AICCCA was formed from the group of counselors who favored telephone delivery of debt management programs. The NFCC was, in the beginning, strongly opposed to this telephone business model, primarily favoring face-to-face counselling as a more effective solution. Eventually, all organizations practiced both phone and face-to-face processes with some agencies using large inbound call centers driven by mass media advertising.  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 made credit counselling a requirement for consumer debtors filing for bankruptcy in the United States. In order to meet this requirement, during the 180-day period preceding the filing of bankruptcy, the debtor must complete a program with an approved non-profit budget and credit counselling agency. Such a program may include, but is not limited to, one counselling session conducted by phone or over the internet. Quickly, the concept caught the attention of other countries and over the last several years, a whole host of countries have undertaken significant initiatives towards credit counselling. The Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS) in the UK, established in 1993, helps consumers with budgeting and better money management as also their debt repayment plans. Funding for CCCS comes from the businesses in the community which benefit from repayment they would not receive if the debtor defaulted. In addition, there is also a National Debt Line through which a bank customer can get free financial advice. In fact, the Banking Code in the U.K. provides that member banks shall discuss financial problems with customers and together evolve a plan for resolving these problems. Canada established a non-profit counselling organization in 2000. Termed Credit Counseling Canada (CCC), the organization seeks to enhance the quality and availability of not-for-profit credit counselling for all its citizens. The Bank Negara Malaysia has established a Credit Counseling and Debt Management (CCDM) agency to provide credit counselling and loan restructuring advice to individuals. The arrangement is expected to be a prompt and cost-effective means of debt settlement based on the repayment plan between creditors and the debtor without intervention of courts. With rising personal bankruptcies, primarily on unsecured debt, Credit Counseling of Singapore (CCS), established in 2003, is meant to assist financially distressed consumers.  Indian context In India, there has been a sharp growth in credit to household in recent years. According to the all-India Debt and Investment Survey 2003, nearly a fourth of the households were indebted in 2002. The per cent of indebtedness households in rural areas increased sharply from 23 in 1991 to 27 in 2003; the corresponding figures for urban areas during the same period were 19 and 18, respectively. At end-March 2004, the total number of loan accounts under direct finance to farmers was nearly 20 million, comprising over 95 per cent of total number of loan accounts under the priority sector; the amount involved was well over 70 per cent of total priority sector loans.  Even taking into account the changes in classification and coverage, bank credit to housing and consumer durables witnessed an exponential growth rate of over 50 per cent during 2001-2006, nearly double the growth recorded in overall non-food credit over the same period. As a consequence, the share of housing and consumer durables in overall non-food credit by scheduled commercial banks increased from around 5 per cent in 2001 to nearly 14 per cent in 2006.  Rapid economic growth coupled with demographic dynamics has led to a significant change in consumers’ perceptions in our country. With a burgeoning middle-class and changing lifestyle aspirations, more and more people are resorting to debt to finance their consumption and asset creation. At some stage in some cases, this could potentially lead to excesses, precipitating defaults. Such defaults could also be the fallout of circumstances beyond one’s control. Costly medical emergencies, retrenchment from job, hardening of interest rates could inadvertently raise debt burdens in some cases not easily manageable within a given income stream. This is partly reflected in the growing number of customer complaints against banks in the recent past. Over the period January 2 BIS Review 82/2006 
2003 to June 2005, the number of complaints relating to loans, credit cards and harassment in recovery aggregated nearly 34 per cent of total number of complaints, which reinforces the need for credit counselling in a dynamic economic environment.  The proportion of people dependent on agriculture still remains high in our country. With a predominantly rain-fed agriculture, monsoonal vagaries coupled with lack of adequate risk mitigation policies could sometimes lead to hardship for the rain-dependent segment of the population. This needs to be considered in conjunction with the fact that the levels of literacy in our country are still relatively modest at 65.4 per cent in 2001, with wide differentials between urban and rural areas. For instance, in 2001, the proportion of rural literate was about 59 per cent as compared with 80.3 per cent in the urban areas. Additionally, the organised sector employment presently comprises less than 10 per cent of the workforce, leaving the vast majority of the working population with irregular income streams and paucity of defined safety net, making them susceptible to unforeseen contingencies. This assumes even greater relevance in situations where the penetration of formal finance is less than adequate, presumably compelling people to take recourse to costly informal finance, often in conjunction with loans from banks.  While the ‘arithmetics’ of extending credit are often diligently followed by lenders, in the absence of consistent credit histories, banks are often at a loss in case of non-repayment by borrowers. Given the growing indebtedness, there is an increasing need to develop follow-up services to enable distressed borrowers overcome credit delinquencies. Credit counsellor thus offers a viable task-specific, advisory ad hoc intermediary between the borrower and the bank concerned.  Counselling on the above lines generally serve three purposes. First, it examines ways to solve current financial problems. Second, by creating awareness about the costs of misusing a credit, it improves financial management and develops realistic spending plans. Third, it advises the distressed people to gain access to the structured financial system, including banking. However, such counselling will be appropriate only if it addresses unique situations of households in different parts of India.  Processes, costs and benefits It is technically possible for credit counselling to be ex ante or ex post. Ex ante counselling helps borrowers to decide upon the quantum of loans they can avail, based on their income profile and stream of cash flows. More importantly, ex ante counselling attempts to influence the stability of the borrowers’ flow of income and expenses, thereby lowering the probability of default. Ex post counselling typically occurs after a crisis event, when the borrower has already missed one or several payments. The purpose of such counselling is to prevent default and foreclosure. It is, therefore, curative in nature. Credit counselling in practice generally tends to be ex post in nature. Such counselling involves one-on-one meetings, allowing the counsellor to observe the level of maintenance of the debt and other issues relevant to the stability of the borrower's situation. It includes advice on not only crisis management, and budgeting but also exploring avenues and networks that can provide succour in the interim. Owing to these reasons, such counselling can be expensive, owing to the not-so-insignificant administrative costs involved. A credit counselling agency often receives most of its compensation from the creditors to whom the debt payments are distributed. This funding relationship could lead to the impression that credit counselling agencies are merely collections wings of the creditors. It is therefore essential to guard against these undesirable possibilities.  In many instances, nurturing a borrower back to health after a default can be a time-consuming process, besides causing severe inconvenience for the distressed families. Traditional banking technologies rely mainly on a set of pre-assigned standards to determine whether a potential borrower will be able to service a loan. This lack of knowledge on low-income household circumstances restricts the banks ability to objectively assess whether the expected loan can be sustainable.  Sometimes, a two-track approach towards mitigation of borrower risks is advocated. In the near-term, credit counselling can constitute an integral part of banks’ loan application, which can facilitate better assessment of credit risk and repayment capacity. In the urban areas, where people are more techno-savvy, such counselling can take place over the internet or the phone. In the rural areas, such interface could be made more personalised through direct face-to-face interaction with the affected clientele. Such preventative counselling would enable the borrower to determine the optimal level of BIS Review 82/2006 3 
sustainable debt and pre-empt deterioration of accounts at a future date. This is also likely to lower the incidence of customer complaints against banks.  An important consequence of the counselling process may be that, as potential borrowers learn more about the way financial markets function, they may learn to behave more strategically and to prepay more often when interest rates are benign. If such behavior becomes prevalent, together with a positive effect of counselling on default, it may be an additional argument that counselling helps low-income borrowers.  Issues It is necessary to recognise that there are several issues which require to be addressed in identifying possible approaches to initiate and popularise credit counselling for individual borrowers. Let me flag some of these issues for your consideration.  First, how well can we combine credit counselling with some elements of financial literacy?  Second, should credit counselling concentrate on ex ante or only on ex post elements or some combination of both?  Third, should credit counselling agencies devise differential mechanisms to take into account different credit segments such as housing loans, consumer loans, farm loans as well as different categories of individual borrowers such as salaried, self-employed, seasonally employed etc? Is it better to have more general credit counsellors? Fourth, given the differential nature of cash flows and consumption patterns in rural and urban areas, is there a need for a segmented approach towards credit counselling? Fifth, should there be accreditation of credit counsellors? If so, who should do it - industry association or individual banks? Should counselling be a full-time or part-time work for the credit counsellors? Sixth, what should be the elements of confidentiality that are assured in this process to gain the confidence of distressed borrowers in need of counselling?  Seventh, how do we select the credit counsellors, equip them to do the work and make them accountable? What type of training - both in terms of knowledge and attitude - could be imparted to make credit counsellors effective? Can the training colleges of banks be of help in this respect? Eighth, should there be a role for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and consumer organisations in order to expand the outreach of counselling practices?  Finally, should the findings emanating from the discussion of credit counsellors constitute part of the agenda for the District-Level Bankers' Committees?  I have only touched upon some of the issue germane to the initiation of the process at the present juncture. What is, however, important is to recognise that instead of a 'one-size-fits-all', banks should be free to experiment and evolve their own mechanisms and adopt approaches best suited to their business philosophy. Since financial counselling pertains primarily to individual borrowers at the local level, a decentralised approach could prove useful. Being a relatively new area whose potential is still to be proved, it is imperative to proceed in measured steps and reassess the situation based on the experience gained. In progressing towards this laudable objective, we, however, should not create another cadre of employees or potentially avoidable intermediaries between banks and their borrowers.  We, in Reserve Bank are happy to note the initiative taken by Bank of India in starting credit counselling centres on a pilot basis. The involvement of trust 'Abhay' lends value and credibility to this pilot project. It is also noteworthy that one each in urban and rural areas is being initiated. We are looking forward to learn from the experience of this laudable initiative. I commend other banks to attempt some pilot projects, as considered appropriate by them, to explore the potential for beneficial use of credit counselling. Thanking you.  4 BIS Review 82/2006 
Peter Tari: Overview of the Vanuatu economic performance Presentation by Mr Peter Tari, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, at the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, Port Vila, 7 June 2006. *      *      * Overview and performance • Vanuatu’s economic performance has been affected by a number of factors, including the smallness and isolations of the islands, globalizations and gradual loss of preferential markets, natural calamities, lack of capacity and political instability. • Vanuatu is made up of some 80 mostly volcanic islands that extend approximately 1,176km in a north-south direction. The total land area is 12,281.25 Km² and the current crude population density is estimated at 17 persons per Km². The country’s population growth rate is 2.6 percent per annum and a real GDP per capita estimated at USD718 in 2004. The current population is estimated to be around 240,000, of which 80% are said to be living in rural areas and are engaging agriculture. • Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, and it makes up approximately 70 percent of the country’s exports. Despite the fact that agriculture supports the bulk of the population, it is not the leading contributor to GDP. In the last six years agriculture make up on average 18.3 percent of GDP. The services sector dominates the economy, accounting for around 73% of total GDP followed by the agriculture. Within the services sector, the wholesale and retail sector dominates with around 40%. Tourism, which makes up around 16% of GDP, is becoming an important sector of the economy generating around 75% of the total foreign exchange earned by the country. • Economic growth since independence in 1980 has been erratic. The fluctuating trend in Vanuatu’s economic growth was caused by a number of factors including political instability, the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters and changing international prices for Vanuatu’s exports, and a whole of other factors. • The last five years also saw marked variations in growth. After two successive years of contraction in 2001 and 2002, real GDP rebounded in 2003 and has since been recording positive growth. Growth in 2003 and 2004 ranged from 4-5% and has been driven by Agriculture and Services sectors. Positive real GDP growth continued in 2005 but at lower magnitude compared the preceding two years. In 2005, the services and industry sectors continue to grow therefore more than offset a negative contribution from the Agriculture sector. The services sector grew by 4.7 percent in 2005, with much of the growth being attributed to growth in transport and communication by 12.1 percent and in Finance and Insurance by 16.3 percent. • The Agriculture sector declined in 2005 after experiencing growth for 2003 and 2004. The downturn in Agriculture is driven by copra which in turn was caused by a drop in copra prices which had an effect on production. Cocoa also indicated a decline in 2005, mainly due to a drop in export prices. Kava also experienced a decline in 2005, following a temporary ban in Fiji for Vanuatu kava. This lower decline in agriculture output continues towards the first half of 2006 but is expected to improve towards the end of the year. • On the fiscal front, the Government has for the past few years achieved fiscal consolidation. Much of the improvement has been attributed to improving economic conditions and inflows of donor funds but also to good control measures over expenditures. Reflecting the good outturn in fiscal operations the Government managed to retire some of its domestic debts in 2005. Also the Government is no longer heavily dependent on the overdraft facility at the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu given its improve fiscal management. • The Reserve Bank makes regular assessment of the economy and adjusts its monetary policy stance accordingly. Last year in June 2005, the Bank, following its regular assessment of the economy was satisfied that macroeconomic stability has been achieved and that the macroeconomic variables that it monitors against its policy settings have improved. Based on this assessment it relaxed its monetary policy stance by reducing its rediscount rate from BIS Review 82/2006 1 
6.5 to 6.25 percent. On 15th March 2006 the Bank further relaxed its monetary policy stance by reducing its official interest rate from 6.25 percent to 6.00 percent. Challenges for Vanuatu 1. Continue to maintaining macroeconomic stability in order to promote growth; 2. Promoting private sector development as an engine of growth; 3. Political Stability has to be maintained for a conducive investment climate; 4. Raising investments by removing impediments 5. Promoting Small and Medium Enterprises so that economic growth is more balanced and broad based; The private sector development is more challenged because of good governance issues, unpredictable policy environment, poor infrastructure and the need for improvement of law and order. Outlook • The current favorable performance of the economy is expected to continue in 2006 and for the next two years. In 2006, the economy has been forecasted to grow by 3.9 percent and by 4.3 percent during 2007. The services sector is expected to continue to drive the economy forward but also the industry sector is expected to contribute favorably if the Millennium Challenge Account projects are implemented. The agriculture sector is also anticipated to improve in 2006. • The Balance of Payment of the country outlook appears favorable. Official international reserves have increased to a comfortable level of 6 months of import cover in May 2006, and are expected to continue to increase in 2006. 2 BIS Review 82/2006 
Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj: Bahrain’s experience as single regulator Presentation by His Excellency Rasheed Mohammed Al Maraj, Governor of the Bahrain Monetary Agency, at the Arab Central Bank Governors' Meeting “Bahrain's Experience as a Single Regulator”, Algiers, 4 September 2006. *      *      * Fellow Governors, Excellencies: My remarks today will focus on Bahrain’s experience with the single regulator model. I will briefly outline the main arguments supporting the single regulator model, as well as some of the arguments made against it. I will then describe Bahrain’s own experience in creating a single regulator, and draw some conclusions from this. First, what are some of the arguments typically encountered in the debate on financial regulatory structures, when considering the single regulator model? In principle, regulatory structures can be categorized according to two basic types – those that are essentially focused on a class of financial institution or sector - such as insurance brokers or banks - and those that are based around specific regulatory functions or objectives – such as investor protection or the prudential soundness of financial sector firms. Historically, many jurisdictions have operated multiple regulators, reflecting the way financial sector regulation has evolved in the industrialized world. This evolution typically saw banking supervision become the first to develop in a formal manner, usually as an extension of the mandate of central banks (because a stable banking system is important to running effective payment systems and monetary policy). Insurance and securities supervision typically developed separately, usually at a later stage. Securities regulators, furthermore, have tended to focus more on investor protection than on wider issues of systemic stability: many could be categorized as functional rather than sectoral regulators, as in many cases their responsibilities have cut across different classes of institutions.  From the late 1980s onwards, however, various jurisdictions started implementing new regulatory structures by merging their regulators, often into a single body. North European countries such as Norway (1986), Denmark (1988) and Sweden (1991) led the way. But it was moves in the UK and Japan (both in 1998) that gave a major impetus to this trend. Since then, there has been a steady stream of countries changing to a single regulator model. Three main arguments are usually advanced to support the creation of integrated regulators. The first is that sector-based regulators no longer reflect the reality of evolving financial markets and players, which has blurred the boundaries between financial sectors and seen the growth in ‘cross-sectoral’ groups, or conglomerates. As groups develop across different sectors or product types, they face the problem of having to deal with a growing number of regulators, ostensibly focusing on different aspects of their operations, but raising the risks of duplication or regulatory underlap. Even where the activities of an institution or group remain limited to a single sector, they may potentially face multiple functional regulators. In short, traditional regulatory structures are viewed as increasingly ill-adapted to a rapidly evolving financial services industry, increasing both regulatory costs for the industry and heightening the risk of supervisory failures. The second argument is that integrated regulators can operate more efficiently as a single body – in other words, that they can achieve economies of scale. Thus, a single regulator can reduce its own costs by moving to a single set of support services, a unified management structure, and a unified approach to rule making and supervision. Third, it is argued that single regulators can achieve economies of scope. In other words, they can address cross-sector issues more effectively as a single body, rather than as multiple regulators – whether this be in terms of developing rules of cross-sector applicability (such as on corporate governance or anti-money laundering), or in addressing supervisory concerns (e.g. the impact of falling asset prices on financial sector firms). A single regulator should be better at reaching a BIS Review 81/2006 1 
comprehensive view of risks facing a financial sector, and responding accordingly – for instance, by moving staff to supervise sectors where risks are increasing. What are some of the arguments against the single regulator model? Some people have argued that there are fundamental differences between prudential supervision – i.e. ensuring that an institution does not fail – and conduct of business regulation – i.e. ensuring that an institution treats its customers fairly and in accordance with good market practice or applicable regulations. The former has tended to be less rules-based and less confrontational – indeed, prudential supervisors often don’t want to publicize their actions, for fear of further undermining confidence in an institution. The latter has tended to be more legalistic in approach, focused simply on whether compliance with the rules has been achieved, and ensuring compliance through tough enforcement and publicity – fines, ‘naming and shaming’, and so on. – Combining these functions in a single entity is thus problematic, or so the argument goes. In my view, these differences can be over-emphasised; in many jurisdictions, furthermore, there has in recent years been an evolution in supervisory approaches, which has further reduced the differences between these different types of regulation. To the extent that differences remain, it can also be argued that it is better to internalize these and resolve them within a single institution. Other arguments against the single regulator model tend to focus more on institutional factors, many specific to particular jurisdictions. It has been said that single regulators are too powerful – although the answer here is better accountability mechanisms. In some countries, creating single national regulators is difficult, either because of institutional rivalries, with existing bodies able to resist a loss of responsibility, or because of regional issues. (Each of the USA’s 52 states, for instance, retains their own insurance regulator.) Though powerful obstacles, these arguments don’t so much call into question the rationale for a single regulator; rather, they highlight that specific political or institutional obstacles may make such a move difficult, within a particular jurisdiction.  Until a few years ago, regulatory structures in the Gulf were essentially sectoral in nature, and Bahrain was no exception. Banks tended to dominate the financial sector, and the primary focus of regulation was therefore on the banking sector. In all cases, responsibility for regulating and supervising the banking sector rested with central banks. The regulatory mandates of central banks in the region also extended beyond banks, in most cases, to cover certain types of non-bank institutions (such as money changers and sometimes investment firms); but insurance supervision was separately regulated by Commerce Ministries, and the stock market (and its broking members) were run as self-regulatory organizations. In May 2002, the Government of Bahrain announced the transfer of regulatory responsibility for the insurance sector and capital markets from, respectively, the Ministry of Commerce and the Bahrain Stock Exchange, to the BMA. This was a far-reaching reform, creating the first integrated regulator in the region, and bringing together under one roof both prudential and conduct of business regulation for the whole financial sector. In addition, the BMA retained its responsibilities as a central bank for systemic stability (including oversight of the payments system and monetary policy), as well as other central bank functions such as currency issue, reserves management and provider of banking services to government departments. In short, the scope of the BMA’s responsibilities is similar to those of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, but is otherwise unique for a single institution in the Gulf region. What were the reasons for the above reforms? The key advantages for Bahrain in moving to a single regulator lie mainly in the economies of scale and scope that could be achieved. For a relatively small country such as ours, the impact of these economies is significant.  Not only have we been able to save on some of our own costs, but we have also reduced costs to the industry by creating a simple and easily understood regulatory framework, which minimizes the risk of regulatory duplication. We have been able to utilize scarce specialist resources, previously available only in one regulator, across the difference sectors; and we have been able to apply the more extensive supervisory experience available in the banking regulator across the other sectors as well. The net result of the move has been to upgrade the quality of regulation and supervision applied to non-banking sectors, at a time when insurance and capital markets activities are fast developing. Achieving this, however, takes time. Combining different regulatory organizations, each with their own corporate cultures and way of doing things, means that much management attention is required to create a new organization. Staff need to be motivated and retained, to counter the unsettling nature of change. New systems and processes need to be put in place. 2 BIS Review 81/2006 
Also, as with most other jurisdictions that have undertaken such reforms, new laws need to be put in place. In Bahrain’s case, pending the passage of a single financial services law, we were able to make progress by the simple expedient of initially issuing short amendments to the existing sector laws, such as our 1987 Insurance Act – the only change being to transfer regulatory responsibility to the BMA. This allowed us to make a start on integrating the different regulatory organizations early on, even though we continue to operate under different laws for banking, insurance and capital markets. The process of drafting a new, integrated financial services law, and securing its passage through parliament was only recently completed, so without such an approach, implementation of a single regulator would have been delayed several years. Let me finish by drawing together some conclusions from Bahrain’s experience. First, there is no doubt in my mind that the single regulator model is the right approach for a country like Bahrain. I believe it has allowed us to build a more effective and efficient regulatory system; and has allowed us to spread regulatory best practice across the whole financial sector. Separate regulators would simply be sub-optimal in size, in our case. That is not to say that the single regulator is the right model for all countries. Industry specific, institutional or other factors may mean that different approaches would work better in other jurisdictions. Second, I would caution against expecting instant results. It takes time to put in place new laws, and to create a truly integrated organization, with a common understanding as to regulatory approaches and processes. Four years on, we have made significant progress in this direction, but I would be the first to admit that we are still working on these issues. Finally, I would underline the management challenges involved in creating a new regulator. On-going supervisory work of course remains, whilst the additional work of building a new regulator is undertaken – maintaining a ‘business as usual’ approach requires significant commitment from staff. These brief remarks only touch on the surface of the issues surrounding the single regulator debate. Nonetheless, I hope that they provide some helpful pointers for discussion, and perhaps encourage some of you to consider whether your own jurisdictions might also benefit from moving to such a model. Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 81/2006 3 
Burhanuddin Abdullah: Monetary and exchange rate policy in a global financial integration – Indonesian experience Paper by Mr Burhanuddin Abdullah, Governor of Bank Indonesia, presented at the South East Asia – Latin America and Caribbean Countries (SEACEN-LAC) Governors Seminar, Kuala Lumpur, 15 September 2006.  *      *      * Introduction First of all, let me thank BNM for hosting the first SEACEN-LAC Governors Seminar with an excellent arrangement. I am both delighted and honored to be here before Fellow Governors from two regions of separate hemisphere, to discuss important issues of common interest. Indeed, the theme of this seminar “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy and International Financial System” is timely and very relevant for Asian and Latin American economies. We are all aware that over the past two decades, these two regions have undergone daunting challenges in managing monetary and exchange rate, in particular dealing with major external shocks. In spite of our improved resilience in addressing such kind of shocks, thanks to major reforms we have conducted in the aftermath of the late 1990s crises, the downside risks in the global economy could not be dismissed. In fact, under the globalized and integrated financial market, central bankers all over the world, most notably the emerging markets have been confronted with unprecedented potential challenges arising from surges in short term capital flows. Currently, the low interest rates in the international market and concerns over the sustainability of the US twin deficits have been driving factors in pushing capital to flow to emerging markets. At the same time, the high yields on domestic currency-denominated instruments in emerging markets have been the pull factor. As we are all aware, there are distinct characteristics of capital flows during the pre- and post-crisis periods. Before the crisis, capital inflows were mainly associated with efforts by domestic market actors to avail foreign sources of finance through international bank loans and issuance of various global financial instruments. However, since 2003, foreign capital flows have mainly been driven by the flush global liquidity in search of optimum rates of return. The differences between these types of capital inevitably entail different consequences for emerging markets, and as a corollary in monetary and exchange rate policy, which I will briefly elaborate further.  Policy on open capital account Dating back to 1970, Indonesia began to seek liberalizing its capital account. Initially, the liberalization started with the removal of compulsory surrender of export proceeds. By 1982, all types of capital controls were dismantled leaving the capital account virtually open. Until the Asian crisis hit in 1997, the existing restriction on capital inflows were only applied to foreign borrowings by banks and companies with government-linked projects and net open foreign exchange position (NOP) on banks as a prudential regulation.  Prior to the crisis, this system had contributed to sustained high economic growth, thereby promoting our long term development program. Foreign capital inflows had also fostered the deepening of domestic financial sector by expanding market liquidity. However, the benefits of capital inflows, in particular in the early 1990s, were undermined by financial market imperfection stemming from lax regulation and supervision and moral hazard due to implicit guarantees. These problems were reflected in the inefficient allocation of capital, unhedged foreign liabilities, and inflated asset prices. As market confidence in the prospect of the economy of the emerging market in Asia faltered, reversal of capital outflows could not be arrested, thereby leading to capital account crisis.  With the hindsight of the Asian crisis, the Central Bank has sought to strengthen the monitoring on the capital movement and minimize speculative transactions. To this end, in 2001 Bank Indonesia issued a regulation on the non-internationalization of the rupiah. Subsequently, when a wave of capital reversal and speculation against the rupiah triggered by rising world oil prices heightened in 2005, we issued a series of micro policies addressing the imbalances in the demand and supply in the forex market. Furthermore, prudential regulation in the banking sector was also strengthened through a tighter ruling on the NOP and particular transactions in forex trading.  BIS Review 88/2006 1 
Indonesian floating exchange rate regime Needless to say to Fellow Governors that the choice of an exchange rate system depends to a great extent on the condition of a country at a given time. In the current context of Indonesia, under a free capital mobility and limited amount of international reserves, we believe that our floating exchange rate system adopted on August 14, 1997 is an optimal choice. The system, we believe, provides a built-in discipline in a market whereby all other infrastructures are not sufficiently strong. This float will in part create a break on imprudent overseas borrowing, because in doing so market participants will have to factor in the cost of possible movements of rupiah.  We are fully aware that in the case of domestic financial markets with imperfections, such as the thin forex market and limited availability of hedging instruments, a floating rate system often leads to high volatility with adverse consequences on stability. Therefore, while in practice we adopt a floating rate system, we are of the view that smoothing of exchange rate movements is necessary. In fact, our measures to reduce volatility are not unique. As posited by Calvo and Reinhart, almost all countries adopting de jure free floating rate system do not rule out interventions to curb volatility in their exchange rates. Such interventions are conducted both through direct intervention on the forex market and through the use of interest rates. Monetary policy framework in a floating exchange rate regime A logical consequence of a flexible exchange rate system is that the exchange rate can no longer serve as a monetary policy anchor. During our stabilization period under the IMF program, Bank Indonesia adopted base money as an anchor. Over the long run, however, we noticed a number of shortcomings in the use of base money as the operating target, such as the difficulties in achieving its target and the poor signal it transmits to the market. Such a poor signal of monetary policy direction and targets obviously fails to meet the need to maintain market expectations on the future exchange rate movement. In view of those factors, Bank Indonesia adopted a fully-fledged inflation targeting framework in July 2005.  The framework at least consists of three primary characteristics. First, monetary policy is directed towards achievement an inflation target explicitly announced to the public for a specified time horizon. In this regard, under the new Central Bank Law the inflation target is set by the Government. Second, monetary policy must be implemented on a forward-looking basis, responding to future developments in inflation. On the operational level, Bank Indonesia uses the BI Rate as policy rate to respond to the future trend in inflation. In formulating monetary policy, the Taylor-type rule is used as a benchmark. Thus in essence, interest rates used as monetary policy instruments are adjusted in such manner so as to respond to deviations in the inflation gap and output gap. Obviously, rules like these are not to be applied mechanically. A balance between rule and discretion, or constrained discretion, as I see it, is especially necessary when monetary policy must be pursued within an increasingly globalized and complex financial environment. We must always be alert of market developments, whether the money market or markets for goods, and a number of other signals and indicators reflecting domestic and global economic developments. We should also keep in mind that while inflation is the sole objective of a central bank, the public also pursues its own objectives, such as job creation and improvement of incomes. For this reason, the inflation targeting framework retains the fundamental monetary policy paradigm of striking the optimum balance between inflation and output.  Apparently, when a central bank faces a dilemma of choosing between inflation and growth, inflation remains the priority. An example of this can be seen in the problems we faced last year, when world oil prices almost doubled. This disturbing trend became highly problematic for monetary policy because not only did it boost inflationary pressure, but also inhibit economic growth. Many suggested that the central bank did not need to respond to this temporary surge in inflation. However, our view at the time was that despite the temporary nature of the disturbance, the inflationary impact emanating from the higher oil prices through increased price for other goods and services, such as transport and wages, would drive up core inflation. In this situation, the tight policy was necessary to prevent sustained escalation in public inflation expectations. The third characteristic of the ITF is that monetary policy is implemented on a transparent basis with measured accountability. In my view, with elements like these, inflation targeting is more than a mere framework for monetary policy. Inflation targeting promotes the good governance of a central bank. By announcing the inflation target to the public, the central bank commits itself to its achievement. 2 BIS Review 88/2006 
Uncertainty over future inflation will ease because public inflation expectations have a point of reference, and thus economic costs arising from uncertainty will also be reduced. Communication to the public on the future monetary policy direction is also vital so that the public can anticipate the central bank monetary policy and to avoid ‘surprises’ that could trigger volatility in the money market.  To strengthen policy effectiveness in this present age of disclosure, the central bank must also carry out a process of educating the public on what the monetary policy objectives are, the strategy for achieving these objectives, and what lies behind the decisions taken. One example involves the communication of the monetary policy response to soaring oil prices and risks from global imbalances at a time of weak conditions in the real sector and high unemployment. Communications between the central bank and market players are also necessary, especially when financial markets are experiencing turbulence. In financial markets fraught with asymmetric information, the wealth of information held by the central bank is frequently of great benefit in mitigating this issue and thus preventing panic and herding by investors. In this regard, the credibility of the central bank is crucial. Concluding remarks Under the environment of financial integration, the task of a central bank in maintaining both monetary and financial system stability has become more challenging. To navigate under this changing environment, in my view a central bank should have at least three critical tools at its discretion. First is the flexible exchange rate system, which provides for autonomy of monetary policy. Second is a monetary policy framework which is consistent, credible, and transparent so as to provide a monetary policy anchor within the flexible exchange rate system. Third is a strong banking system capable of absorbing the various risks created by financial globalization. The mounting risks and uncertainties emerging within the financial globalization process also underscore the importance of the central bank role in guiding public expectations. Within this context, the credibility of the central bank is crucial. To this end, transparency, accountability, and effective communication must be integral to the entire monetary management process. In short, communication may serve as an additional “instrument” that a central bank should use at its disposal to complement other monetary instruments for monetary policy to operate effectively.  Thank you. BIS Review 88/2006 3 
Eva Srejber: Greater budgetary discipline in the EU through transparency and national ownership Speech by Ms Eva Srejber, First Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a breakfast seminar organised by Ernst & Young, Stockholm, 26 September 2006. *      *      * Fiscal and monetary policy are interdependent. A government needs transparent and consistent monetary policy to know how to conduct fiscal policy. Similarly, no monetary policy will be sustainable if there is a rapid accumulation of debt. This is what Sweden witnessed in the 1980s and the early 1990s. An unsustainable mix of fixed exchange rates and lax fiscal policy, which led to high inflation and eventually to a crisis that landed us with an even higher mountain of debt. When the regime collapsed, General Council decided that the Riksbank should work towards a direct inflation target. The Riksbank determined that the target would be two per cent. Today this policy is hailed as a success. However, the real breakthrough for the new regime was in the mid-1990s when a forceful implementation of fiscal consolidation, supported by a broad political majority in parliament, made the macroeconomic set-up as a whole credible. It was only then that inflation expectations among the public finally fell to the target of 2 per cent, and interest rate spreads against Germany were reduced substantially. This fiscal tightening could in turn be based on the predictability of the new monetary regime with a clear inflation target. And the tighter fiscal policy would eventually allow less restrictive monetary policy. Why are budgetary rules needed at EU level? This interaction is fairly well understood, if not always acted upon, at national level. But at the EU level there is an extra dimension. Many countries’ fiscal policies are now matched by a single monetary policy. One possible risk is that the ECB would in the end have to bail out a fiscally undisciplined country from an unsustainable debt. However, many EU member states’ unwillingness to meet the Stability and Growth Pact has shown that problems can arise before matters have gone as far as to a full-blown debt crisis. The problem might be a bias towards fiscal laxity that has to be counterbalanced by tighter monetary policy - hence a bad policy mix. With a single monetary policy the effect of fiscal stimulus in one country will be diluted in the whole area and will therefore by definition meet with less of a monetary policy response than it would if monetary policy had been national. Furthermore the nature of the political set-up makes it more difficult for the ECB to comment on individual national budgets. This means that there will be a strong temptation to “free-ride” by expanding the budget at the expense of fellow euro area nations. But the dilemma goes further – given that it is rational for others to expand their budgets it becomes rational for your own country to do so too – even if your instinct is not to “free-ride”. Otherwise you might rationally expect to end up among the small minority that does not expand and at the same time still have the tighter monetary policy that results from everyone else expanding. This is the classic “prisoner’s dilemma” from game theory. The conclusion is that it is necessary to have rules for fiscal policy that limit deficits and debt when monetary policy is united and fiscal policy divided, and that these rules need to be followed in a credible fashion. But, in addition, the conclusion is also that the temptation to over-expand is as strong during an upturn as during a downturn. In fact this is what we have seen in the euro area during the heyday of the late 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century – a much too expansionary fiscal stance in some euro area countries, especially in good times, which led to tighter monetary policy by the ECB and thus an incentive for others to further weaken fiscal discipline. When the downturn eventually came, the euro area entered this phase with large deficits instead of surpluses. What the Pact then required, a 180-degree turnaround in fiscal policy to a tighter stance, reinforced the downturn and was considered by some as stupid. In fact it was the lack of savings BIS Review 88/2006 1 
during the boom that was stupid. Thus, rules would be needed not only for a maximum deficit in a downturn, but equally some forceful rule for fiscal rectitude in good times. How has the Pact changed? The fiscal problems encountered by some countries during the downturn triggered a change of the Stability and Growth Pact. In my view, changes were necessary and many of the amendments to the Pact go in the right direction. However, some of them make the framework less predictable. The change consists of three parts: better governance, changes in the preventive arm and changes in the corrective arm. Better governance Better governance includes better budgetary discipline at national level, more realistic forecasting and more reliable statistics. National budgets should be complementary to the member states’ commitments under the Stability and Growth Pact. National institutions could play a more prominent role in budgetary surveillance through increased attention to the development of public finances in public opinion. But apart from those general words, the reformed pact does not spell out any guidelines for appropriate developments of national institutions. Within the EU we have now begun to analyse various forms of national regulations. I hope that the continued work will lead to stronger anchoring of fiscal policy among the member states. I will return to this question a little later. More realistic forecasting consists of having some common assumptions, mainly on external developments, in the stability and convergence programmes. The experiences from the first year of the reformed Pact indicate that it has led to more realistic national growth forecasts. More reliable statistics refer to budget data problems ranging from creative accounting via methodological problems to understaffed and non-independent statistical compilers. The problems are tackled by strengthening Eurostat and allowing it to make methodological visits in the member states, to discuss budget issues. A new high level group with a mandate to advise Eurostat will be established. As Eurostat monitors the member states’ compliance with the agreed practice, the high level group also, indirectly, advises the member states. My view is that all the reforms in this area of the Stability and Growth Pact go in the right direction since they encourage fiscal prudence. However, given the complicated process and the short time since the Pact was changed, it is too early to determine whether the changes have been a complete success. Changes in the preventive arm Changes in the preventive arm have been made in the area of medium term objectives (MTO) for the budget balance. Member states are divided into groups depending on their debt level. Stricter MTOs are required for countries with higher debt. The MTOs for the euro area and the ERM2 countries range from a deficit of 1% of GDP to balance or surplus depending on the debt level. The countries that have not achieved their MTOs are supposed to follow an adjustment path to the objectives. The path requires more consolidation in good times. For the euro area and ERM2 states, the adjustment requirement is a yearly improvement of the cyclically adjusted deficit net of one off effects by 0.5% of GDP. This is a strengthening compared to the earlier agreement among the euro area countries, changing the requirement from targeting the cyclically adjusted deficit to targeting an improvement in the structural deficit. When deciding the adjustment path, public investment and structural reforms can be taken into account. If structural reforms are to be taken into account, they should have a large and proven positive effect on the economy and there should be a safety margin to the 3% deficit floor. My view is that there is a possibility to use the newly defined MTOs in a wise manner, more closely adapted to the situation of the individual country. However, the scope for interpretation is so large that there is a high risk of lax and uneven implementation. The experiences of the first year indicate that some member states have more ambitious MTOs than required by the Pact. This is often countries with their own national budgetary rules, such as Sweden, which comprise MTOs. At the same time, 2 BIS Review 88/2006 
there are other member states who need to do more to achieve their MTOs. The measures are often postponed too far ahead and are not sufficiently explicit and concrete. Changes in the corrective arm The third part of the changes refers to what happens when a country has an excessive deficit. As before, exemptions can be granted if the country is suffering from a severe economic downturn that it could not foresee, so called exceptional circumstances. The definition of a severe economic downturn has been changed, however. According to the old agreement, a country experiencing a fall in GDP of 0.75% could be exempted from the EDP and a fall in GDP by 2% always led to exemption. Now the GDP requirement is changed to negative growth or a period of very low growth relative to potential. Exemptions can also continue to be granted by taking into account other relevant factors, on condition that the deficit is temporary and close to the reference level. But the number of other relevant factors to be included in the judgement of whether an EDP should be initiated or not has been increased. Such factors now include not only public investment but also potential growth, the Lisbon agenda achievements, R & D, pension reforms, international solidarity, and European policy goals. In my opinion, there is a risk here that the Pact could be interpreted differently and be applied differently to different countries. It will therefore be important to closely follow up how the revised Pact is applied in this respect. So far, however, no exemptions have been granted under the new Pact. The countries that have exceeded the three per cent limit have also been assessed to have an excessive deficit. If countries are found to have an excessive deficit, they now can have a longer time frame for taking effective action to correct the deficit and a longer timeframe to the initial deadline for correcting the excessive deficit. Normally, the timeframe will continue to be 2 years after the excessive deficit occurred. However, the revised Stability and Growth Pact now allows for the possibility to extend this timeframe to 3 years. In my view, this is a positive change since the earlier system in practice meant that countries only had a few months to correct an excessive deficit, and this did not increase the respect for the Stability and Growth Pact. However, in addition, a possibility to revise the initial deadline has been introduced which creates a risk for an excessively prolonged EDP. To summarise, some of the changes in the Stability and Growth Pact thus go in the right direction and might enhance the discipline, while other changes introduce a flexibility that could be abused. As always, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. So far, budget plans have not moved in the stricter direction despite the fact that growth prospects have improved. The yearly average deficit for the euro area will stay at about 2.4% of GDP for the next couple of years according to present plans. The structural deficit is expected to improve only marginally between 2005 and 2006 – from 2.2 to 2.1 per cent – despite a strong economy. It is important to stock up now ready for future times with lower growth. The recovery and consolidation of the EU’s largest economy, Germany, is of central importance in this context. Why have we not seen the problems earlier? The question is why we didn’t see the problems in the Stability and Growth Pact from the beginning? Perhaps because we were fortunate to have something that could work as a temporary replacement for rules: clear objectives, strong leadership and the market as a quickly reacting judge. Most countries wanted to meet the convergence criteria and thereby join the euro area. Germany led the way, both in terms of its economic size and its example of fiscal discipline. Now the objective of joining the euro has been achieved for many countries, and, in addition, Germany has lost its leading role and the markets react less to fiscal laxity. Instead of national leadership towards clear objectives we have seen the opposite – the political exploitation of the gap between the national and European level. The requirements of the Pact are blamed on heartless “accountants in Brussels”, and when a majority within the countries puts narrow national political interests first the agreed rules become moot – “peer pressure” becomes ”peer protection”. Incorrect facts have been more or less deliberately sent to the Commission ahead of sensitive elections. A study by Barclays Capital shows that during the years 2000-2003 growth projections were overestimated by 1.5 percentage points on average each year by the euro area countries, leading to fiscal balances turning out worse than expected on average by about 1% of GDP per year. In fact, a BIS Review 88/2006 3 
study by the ECB shows that the closer a country comes to an excessive deficit, the more likely it is that the forecast the government presents officially will later turn out to be wrong. There is a strong bias towards unrealistic optimism once a country’s deficit approaches 3% of GDP. The same result was indicated in a study by Lars Jonung and Martin Larch. What challenges does the future hold? Let me say something in this respect about the new member states. It is all too apparent that the collapse of Germany’s leading role in fiscal discipline has also set a bad example for some of the larger new member states. This despite the fact that Germany now appears to be in the process of correcting its deficit. Given that public finances did deteriorate so much in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic during the first years of this century it is fortunate both for themselves and for the euro area that these countries have postponed joining ERM II and the attempt to rapidly adopt the euro. They have made clear that their government finances must be in order before the process of joining the euro area begins. Had they tried and locked their currencies within ERM II they may well have stayed in that position for a long time, becoming in the meantime targets for speculation – as their poor public finances would have lent little credibility to their overall economic policy. This was Sweden’s experience with the combination of a currency peg and deteriorating public finances in 1991-1992. But now there is another danger. Given that the target of imminent euro adoption is gone, and the large euro area nations do not provide real leadership on fiscal soundness, there is less incentive for some of the new member states to stick to the consolidation of their public finances. This is especially obvious for Hungary, where the deficit was 7.5 per cent in 2005 and is, according to present plans, expected to increase to around 10% this year. For Poland and the Czech Republic the deficits will stay at the present level of around 3% in the coming two years. Whether in the old or new member states, there is an additional problem, as we are entering a period of intensifying structural changes. Old industrial patterns in Europe are being changed when confronted with both the boost to productivity from IT and globalisation and enlargement, all of which supports this process. These trends will eventually help productivity and growth in Europe to start catching up with the US again. But in the short term the structural changes will lead to higher frictional unemployment as old industries are more rapidly replaced by new ones. In addition, the recent downturn never led to a dramatic increase in unemployment or a dramatic decrease in employment in the euro area; hence, the upturn is probably also less likely to lead to rapid job creation. Both of these factors create new incentives for fiscal policy to focus more on short-term job creation schemes and less on long-term fiscal soundness. And the new member states are not much different in this respect. They have experienced a decade of incredible structural change, and yet more is ahead. Furthermore the new member states have great infrastructure needs and, coupled with high unemployment, there will be continued pressure for fiscal expansion, even in a cyclical upturn. So from this perspective, too, the hope that the recovery alone will “fix” the European deficit problem might be too optimistic. In addition, structural fiscal deficits in many of the euro area member states might be larger than present calculations show since there is a large risk that potential growth is lower than commonly assumed. Estimates of potential growth for the old Europe have successively been lowered as labour productivity growth has fallen gradually during the last two decades from around 2% to about 1% per year. However, the figures for the second quarter of this year were the highest we have seen for some time. The IMF’s latest potential growth estimate for the euro area is about 1.8%. Nevertheless, inflation has been remarkably stable, just above 2% in recent years despite poor growth and presumed large negative output gaps. If potential growth is lower, the need for fiscal consolidation is even higher than present consolidation programmes show. Let me summarize the problem. Countries with larger fiscal deficits have had a more procyclical policy both in good times and in bad times. A Commission paper finds a significant impact of elections on procyclicality, especially procyclical tax cuts. In addition, the structural deficits are most likely higher than presumed. With lower potential growth, the ECB will need to push the brakes earlier and more forcefully than most people assume. Hence, the long awaited help from growth to fix the deficit problems and the debt-to-GDP ratios will most likely not materialize. Deficits and debts could 4 BIS Review 88/2006 
deteriorate even further when pressures from an ageing population will kick in within the next five years. Is there a solution? Let me first note an interesting development: 1999-2004 the average yearly fiscal deficit in the euro area has been 1.9 per cent of GDP while the average yearly (unweighted) surplus of the three old out-countries (the UK, Denmark and Sweden) has been 1.1 per cent of GDP. This despite the fact that the UK has moved from a comfortable surplus position to a deficit of 3.3% of GDP in 2004. Some euro-sceptics will of course attribute this difference to monetary union itself but I think the difference is rather that all three out-countries have been forced to find new ways of building a strong national macroeconomic framework based on clearly stated goals and a transparent evaluation of how these goals are to be met, in addition to the common EU rules. The part that has been much in focus has been the monetary policy regime – in Sweden and the UK, inflation targeting with a specific target for inflation and regular and transparent inflation forecasts has worked well. But inflation targets, or for that matter Denmark’s euro peg, would never have been as successful had fiscal policy not been reformed in parallel, with clear rules and budgetary ceilings in Sweden and Denmark which put the problems squarely in the sight of the public. Considering the UK fiscal deterioration the last couple of years, one might draw the conclusion that the so called golden rule, i.e. only borrowing for public investment, is not a clear enough rule, but that expenditure ceilings and targets for the fiscal balance are more effective. In fact those euro area countries that have some sort of national transparent targets and evaluation of fiscal policy have managed to retain some order in their public finances; Finland being a prominent example. The power of targets and transparency is that the public, with the help of comments from analysts in the media, can evaluate clearly how the government is doing in relation to a long-term norm. Is fiscal policy in line with the target, or is it deviating from target? The idea of being on or off target is quite easy to grasp, and if the process is transparent, experts and the public alike will learn to trust the figures. In this area most countries still have a lot to do. It is a pity that government accounts, which affect everyone in a society in a compulsory way, are less transparent, less well audited and less understood than the accounts of companies listed on the stock exchange, which only affect few people. Sweden has pre-decided ceilings on government expenditure three years ahead and a target of a 2 per cent surplus for the public sector over the business cycle, a figure that includes pension savings and that, given an ageing population, is in fact akin to targeting a balanced budget over the cycle. This target is present in the debate of every budget. The National Institute of Economic Research comments on the target and helps the public to understand it. This keeps the government accountable not only in the normal political sense but also in relation to the targets agreed upon. The political debate is in a sense being taught to keep the long term in view. The public then knows from the national debate that fiscal discipline is good for the country and, if “accountants” in Brussels or other nations criticise your budget policies, there is a greater chance of the criticism being interpreted as a help towards fiscal soundness. The Swedish trade unions, for example, are among the most vocal defenders of our budget target. The expenditure ceilings have been respected but to some extent with the help of creative accounting. In addition, the last couple of years no decisions have been taken on the ceilings for all three years, as was intended. Sweden would perhaps need an even more formal external fiscal evaluation. What are the conclusions? This leads to an important conclusion for the implementation of the “reformed” Stability and Growth Pact of the EU. Perhaps the solution to regain credibility is to build from below – to complement the European level with national frameworks in the respective European nations so that they come to internalise the need to balance their budget over the cycle and to ensure that the same transparency exists on the fiscal side as on the monetary side. While pressure from fellow finance ministers has apparently not worked well enough, the present attempts at national processes with transparent targets have a better track record. BIS Review 88/2006 5 
Why not have all EU countries commit themselves to establishing independent bodies with the responsibility of enhancing transparency by conducting independent forecasts of the countries’ deficits and providing recommendations on a regular basis? They would have only an advisory role and their authority would stem from impartiality and expertise. The subject of their recommendations would be the overall fiscal stance – neither the specifics nor indeed the political orientation of fiscal policy. The protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) attached to the Treaty states that member states shall ensure that national procedures in the budgetary area enable them to meet their obligations. It would therefore be in the spirit of the Treaty to have EU countries commit themselves to establishing these kinds of bodies. Independent forecasts would avoid having unreliable deficit figures before elections, only to “discover” the real state of accounts after the vote – such as has been the case in Portugal, France, Germany, and Hungary and most spectacularly in Hungary and Greece. Happily, there have been some improvements in some member states since the Pact was reformed in March 2005. If they had a similar role to the Congressional Budget Office in the US, the bodies would ensure a reliable and unbiased “reality check” in times of fiscal profligacy. At best, the advisory bodies would create a continuous national dialogue with warnings and recommendations to politicians that would boost transparency and put long-term fiscal goals at the heart of the debate – a reinforced version of the process that has helped Denmark, Finland and Sweden to improve fiscal soundness. The experience of central banks is that transparency and goals help form expectations and behaviour, enlisting the public in the struggle for macroeconomic soundness. After a while, the discipline that initially seemed practically unattainable becomes almost natural. 6 BIS Review 88/2006 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with L’Espresso  An interview with Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted by Mr Claudio Lindner, published 15 September 2006. *      *      * Mr Trichet, let us begin our examination of Europe with the message that the figures are giving us: are we in fact seeing a recovery?  As early as the second half of 2005 our diagnosis was that the euro area was experiencing a gradual recovery and approaching the level of its growth potential. This diagnosis has now been confirmed by the very good data for the second quarter of 2006 which allow us to record good – and better than forecast – progress in the first half of this year. However, a word of caution: this does not mean that we are changing our diagnosis for trend growth. When we had a rather disappointing figure for growth in the fourth quarter of last year we said it did not change our sentiment that trend growth was around potential. I would say the same today after those flattering hard figures. We have to view everything from a medium-term perspective. And we should not discount the level of uncertainty that exists in the world today. Not least because the United States, by contrast, seems to be experiencing a slowdown.  What counts for us right now is the overall economic situation, on a global level, and therefore not just in the United States. The leading economic institutions and private research institutes state that we will probably continue to see a rather dynamic growth rate at a global level. However, you seem to be very concerned with inflation, to the point that many people are betting on a further rate rise before the end of the year, to 3.5%.  The primary mandate assigned to us is to guarantee price stability, and we have to be credible in order to be able to anchor inflation expectations. This is extremely important not only for our credibility, but also because it enables a favourable level of medium and long term market interest rates to be maintained. I am convinced that this is also the sentiment of the 313 million European citizens (315 if we include the Slovenians, who will be the next to join the euro area), who are asking us to safeguard their purchasing power by maintaining price stability. Therefore, this is not only what the Treaty commands us to do but also what our European fellow citizens are emphatically asking us to do. Could inflation trends lead you to adjust rates again?  After our last meeting in Frankfurt, I said, on behalf of the Governing Council, that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that upside risks to price stability are contained. Do you regard the 2% inflation limit as being absolutely inviolable or is there some degree of flexibility?  What has to be kept in mind is that we take a medium-term perspective. Our definition of price stability is that, in the medium term, prices have to grow less than but close to 2%. Inflationary expectations seen by various panels tell us that, over the next five years, inflation is seen at around 1.9%. I believe it is essential that citizens, savers and investors can trust in the fact that we will take all decisions necessary to ensure that inflation remains at these levels in the medium term. For three reasons: because it is our primary mandate; it is what citizens are asking us to do, and because it is a major contribution to sustainable growth and job creation in Europe. Where do you see risks of price increases?  Further increases in oil and commodity prices and in goods and services prices due to past oil price increases. Also additional unexpected increases in administrative prices and indirect taxes. Then, more fundamentally, there are the so-called second-round effects, that is the risk of increases in wages and salaries that would derive from a loss of credibility regarding our capability in countering price increases. It is essential to intervene before these effects materialise. Do your concerns include the increase in VAT to be implemented in Germany in January?  The increase in VAT in Germany, which was decided upon some time ago by the government, had already been incorporated in our analysis.  BIS Review 87/2006 1 
You were in Cernobbio, Italy, in early September. What was the mood among Italian entrepreneurs, politicians and economists?  I saw further confirmation of the great potential of Italy and of the Italian corporate sector, but I also found unanimous agreement that one of the most important problems facing Italy is the insufficient labour productivity and consequently the rise of unit labour costs. It is a European problem, and not only an Italian problem, but in Italy it is particularly visible: we have to do all that we can to implement the Lisbon agenda aiming at accelerating productivity growth. But the Italian industrial structure is weak nowadays. What should be done?  Research carried out in Italy and in Europe, more generally, has concluded that we are not benefiting sufficiently from productivity gains in sectors that use new technology (and not only in the sectors that produce the technology themselves) and this seems to be due to overly rigid labour, goods and services and financial markets. Structural reforms that would allow the economy to be made more flexible are the primary tools for achieving a leap in productivity. In the United States this was made possible in the mid-1990s. And, consequently?  One should never underestimate the importance of investment in research and development, which are today insufficient both in Italy and in the euro area as a whole. You have mentioned structural reforms, which are currently at the heart of the Italian political debate on developments in the finance laws. Let us begin with the deficit-to–GDP ratio, which is well above the 3% limit. Is the situation in Italy a cause for concern for you?  Our message to Italy, as to all euro area countries, is the following: the benefits that higher than expected economic growth is bringing, in particular in terms of higher tax revenues, should be allocated entirely to reducing the public deficit and preventing the growth of debt. That is a kind of recommendation.  Yes. The position of the Governing Council is very well known. We are recommending rigorous compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact. And as a general rule we would suggest first that public spending be reduced, and only after as much as possible has been done in this area, that taxes be increased if necessary in order to comply with the Stability and Growth pact. You know Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa well after having worked with him for so many years here in Frankfurt. Will he do this to improve Italy’s accounts?  Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa is one of the most experienced persons, not only within Italy and Europe, but also in the world. He has personal influence, and personal prestige in all fields of money and finance, which I regard as being very important. Of course, it is clear that the challenges and risks that he faces are enormous.” Being a minister is not like being a banker, the tasks and responsibilities are quite different.  “Tommaso has been a marvellous banker, but he has also held a large number of other responsibilities. These are different tasks, but they both require clear judgement, decision-making ability, strength of character and determination. Let me add that I do not forget myself that central bankers, by definition, have a multipartisan responsibility. Why?  Price stability is a common benefit for all citizens, regardless of their political sensitivities and individual preferences. According to a Financial Times journalist, in the absence of structural reform Italy risks being expelled from the euro. Is that true?  Italy is a very important economy in the euro area and is of course definitely not at risk of this. I have already said that I do not comment on absurd assumptions. Exactly like all other member countries, Italy does need to do its homework: improving productivity and its public accounts.  One of the main stumbling blocks in the negotiations ongoing within the government is the issue of pensions.  2 BIS Review 87/2006 
That of pensions is a European problem, due to the ageing population and the resulting pressure on public funds. Without further reforms to pension systems, the contribution rates would need to be doubled in some countries, up to as much as 40% of salaries in some cases, in order to keep a balance in the system’s accounts. But what should be done in these cases?  In order to tackle the consequences of ageing populations, we need comprehensive reforms. Even if there are no unequivocal solutions, some measures are valid for several countries: raising the retirement age, eliminating early retirement incentives, reduction in replacement rates, integrating public pensions within a system which allows future payments to be financed so that the ageing of the population does not create imbalances between generations. Should men and women retire at the same age?  This is a sensitive and important issue triggering a whole host of reactions and different points of view. Apparently, in accordance with current jurisprudence, I would say they should retire at the same age, as the European Court of Justice maintains that there should be no discrimination or distinction between men and women in any area. How urgent is pension reform?  Extremely urgent, in all euro area countries. When we look at demographic trends, we tend to put it off as we are talking about long-term developments. It seems that the movement is slow and long, and that there is time. However, it is a complete illusion because it is an issue that has to be tackled as early as possible. The more radical left-wing and the unions are opposed to it and say that you are technocrats who only pay attention to numbers. As an important international leader, do you not believe that there are also social costs which need to be taken into consideration? We are, after all, talking about millions of people and all the weakest categories of the population.  It is a crucial factor. Structural reforms of this sort have been decided upon by national governments within the framework of the agreements made in Lisbon and we should not forget that the ultimate objective is to increase the pace of economic growth in order to ensure more prosperity and provide more jobs for everyone, which is fundamental for the weakest and the poorest. Rather than finding a compromise between the various members of our society, between those that have costs and those that reap the benefits, I see it more as a compromise between the present and future. It is a forward-looking investment and a better future for the weakest part of the population which entails costs at the beginning. And in any case let us not forget that we cannot ask our children and grandchildren to pay our bills! In Europe, the population is shrinking to the point that by 2020, according to different studies, there will be 20 million people available for work. In the United States, it is on the rise. How is this?  Perhaps this is because the United States is a population with entire generations of immigrants in which the birth rate is higher. And then there is the cultural aspect, they are more optimistic than us. Why?  This involves philosophical and cultural aspects and I am not convinced that they are structural. There have also been difficult periods in the United States, for example, at the end of the 1980s when Europe was more upbeat and had greater faith in the future, in building something together. These are cyclical phenomena and we at the ECB, together with Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, and the Governor of the Banca d’Italia, Mario Draghi, and the entire Governing Council, try our best to ensure that Europe regains confidence in itself. Credibility is a key word for the ECB. BIS Review 87/2006 3 
Y V Reddy: Foreign exchange reserves – new realities and options Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the 2006 Program of Seminars on the theme "The World in Asia, Asia in the World", Singapore, 18 September 2006. *      *      * Distinguished Friends, I am thankful to the organisers for inviting me to participate in the 2006 Program of Seminars on the Theme "The World in Asia, Asia in the World". The theme for this session has tantalising words: problems, plenty, challenges, opportunities, accumulation, large, foreign, windfall and reserves. It may be a little hard to match the sense of these words in an address by central bankers. So, I intend taking a slightly broader view of the subject and focus on the new realities and innovative ideas. I would argue that there are degrees of comfort at various levels of reserves at any given time and in a country-context and in general, higher the degree of comfort, more numerous are the options. I. New realities of forex reserves and management (i)  Large increase: most rapid in Asia  In the aftermath of the Asian crises, it was widely perceived, supported by academic research and commentators, that large reserves were needed by emerging market economies (EMEs) to withstand any crisis and, to some extent, it was a reflection of the lack of confidence in the international financial architecture. As a result, the recent episode of reserve accumulation has been on a much higher scale and more prolonged than was seen during the early 1990s. For instance, as reported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the EMEs, during 2000 and 2005, accumulated reserves at an annual rate of US $ 250 billion (or 3.5 per cent of their annual combined GDP), which was almost five times higher than the level seen in the early 1990s. The bulk of the reserve accumulation was concentrated in Asia with countries like China, Korea, India, Malaysia and Taiwan (China) witnessing large increases, while countries in Latin America and Central Europe had a fairly modest increase in reserves during this period. Lately, many oil-exporting countries have also seen a large increase in their reserves. It may be useful to recognise that reserve accumulation, in some senses, reflects the savings-investment balances and is symptomatic of both domestic and global factors, including self-insurance, a concept difficult to define.  (ii) Reserves increases: mostly driven by capital account surplus It is important to identify the sources of reserve accretion in this latest episode. There are some countries like Russia where the reserves are built out of current account surplus. In countries like China, Korea and Taiwan, the surplus, in both current and capital account, led to accumulation of reserves. On the other hand, there are countries like India, where the reserves accretion was driven more by capital account surplus and not due to current account surplus, broadly implying that capital inflow was more than what could be normally absorbed in the domestic economy. Net capital flows have remained much larger than the current account deficit in India as well as in most of Latin America and Central & Eastern Europe. In case the reserve accumulation is due to large capital flows, it may be useful to distinguish between debt and non-debt flows as also between foreign direct investment and generally less stable portfolio flows. In fact, the stock as well as flow in each category would be relevant for reserve management. While the marking-to- market of the assets and liabilities may be difficult, it might not be irrelevant.  Thus, while the traditional indicators of adequacy of reserves are based on trade, debt and monetary indicators, or even the ‘Guidotti Rule’ or ‘Liquidity at Risk’ Rule suggested by Alan Greenspan may help explain the adequacy of reserves, they need to be supplemented with, what may be described as, multiple indicators to assess the adequacy of reserves of any country at a given juncture. BIS Review 87/2006 1 
(iii) Difficulties in computing quasi fiscal cost of reserves A simple method of calculating net cost of carrying reserves to the central bank is the difference between the interest rate on domestic securities and the rate of return earned on the foreign exchange reserves adjusted for any exchange rate change. The magnitude of the cost, which is often difficult to estimate, varies with the extent of sterilisation and the yield differentials. These are termed “quasi-fiscal” costs in the literature since the costs to the central bank are passed on to the sovereign through a lower transfer of profits. In countries where local interest rates are well above international levels, such carrying costs could be positive, while if the reverse is true such carrying costs could be negative. A recent study by the BIS has shown that carrying costs are negative in a number of countries at current interest rates. The study states that in China, for instance, the one year interest rate in June 2006 was less than half the comparable US Treasury bond rate. Hence the central bank is earning a positive carry. However, it can be argued that given the inherent cyclical nature of interest rates, such negative carrying cost could reverse over a period of time. Moreover, one has to keep in mind that these hypothetical cost calculations do not capture capital gains or losses. Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has proposed a measure of social cost of reserves, from the national stand point, that is equal to the spread between the private sector's cost of short-term borrowing abroad and the yield that the central bank earns on its liquid foreign assets. He estimates this cost roughly equivalent to one per cent of GDP of the developing countries in 2004. Briefly stated, there are difficulties in calculating precisely quasi-fiscal costs or other costs on this account.  While assessing the fiscal cost of holding reserves, it would be worthwhile to set off the benefits that the country may have in holding reserves. In any country risk analysis by the rating agencies and other institutions, the level of reserves generally has high weights. Moreover, it is essential to keep in view some hidden benefits which could accrue to a country holding reserves, which may, inter alia, include: maintaining confidence in monetary and exchange rate policies; enhancing the capacity to intervene in foreign exchange markets; limiting external vulnerability so as to absorb shocks during times of crisis; providing confidence to the markets that external obligations can always be met; and reducing volatility in foreign exchange markets. It is true that beyond a point, when the credit rating reaches appropriate investment grade, addition to reserves may not lead to further improvement in the credit rating. It is necessary to recognise that, as in the case of costs, there are difficulties in computing the benefits too.  (iv)  Changing composition of reserves  The available data on the composition of official reserves indicate that progress towards diversification of reserves has been cautious, which is not surprising given the very definition of reserves in terms of “external assets that are readily available…..…” as defined by the IMF. An important objective of holding the reserves is to be prepared for contingencies, but the range of instruments available to satisfy this need is limited. Nevertheless, the management of reserves has been changing and there has been a quest for higher returns within these traditional objectives. To quote Mr. Philip D. Wooldridge of the BIS, in his latest article on “The Changing Composition of Official Reserves” in the September 2006 issue of the BIS Quarterly Review: “Continuing a trend that began in the 1970s, when reserves were first reallocated from US Treasury bills to bank deposits, reserve managers have been gradually shifting into higher-yielding, higher-risk instruments. They seem most comfortable managing market risk but are beginning to take on more credit and liquidity risk too. The currency composition of their portfolios, while volatile, has not changed as much as the instrument composition." It is essential to recognise that reserve managers are already shifting into higher-yielding instruments with a higher risk-return equation, presumably as a result of progressively rising level of reserves. Consequently, the financial returns on the free reserves at the margin could be far higher than the average return. In my view, the marginal return appears to be a more relevant concept in the context of alternative forms of investment of reserves. (v) Quasi reserves With the positive shock emanating from large capital flows resulting in significant reserves accumulation in many EMEs, a new development in reserve management is to hold a part of the reserves which could be used by the public sector in a country in a manner different from the strictly defined pattern of holding of the external assets by the monetary authorities. Such foreign exchange 2 BIS Review 87/2006 
reserves could be termed as quasi reserves. In terms of its holding, such quasi reserves could be easily retrievable when the situation demands. In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) basically manage foreign exchange reserves. GIC is the Government’s principal investment agent, handling the bulk of the nation’s investments while the MAS holds reserves to maintain the stability of the Singapore dollar. Similarly, Temasek Holdings invests in Singapore as well as manages diversified global portfolio with the aim of creating and maximising sustainable value for the shareholders and providing resources to finance pension and other benefits. On the pattern of the Singapore's GIC, South Korea has recently established the Korean Investment Corporation (KIC). Another interesting example is China, where foreign exchange reserves have been utilised to strengthen the banking system without foreign securities being sold. China has transferred funds from its international reserves, held with the Peoples’ Bank of China (PBC) to a new company, Central Huijin Investment Company (CHIC), set up in 2003 and jointly managed by the government, PBC and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. In the PBC's balance sheet, the said amount of reserves was replaced by claims on the CHIC. The CHIC used the assets to purchase shares in banks which were to be recapitalised.  (vi) Stabilisation funds Investment funds are sometimes created by the public sector out of "windfall revenue" accruing to a country due to rise in export price of, say, oil or other commodities. Such reserves arise due to positive external shocks which can cause a surge in government revenues and, at times, could be challenging as some Governments may have to deal with an appreciating exchange rate, undermining export competitiveness with symptoms of "dutch disease". Many countries such as Chile, Kuwait, Norway, Russia and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have institutionalised the investment of the surplus arising from the positive shocks of commodity and oil prices by creating sophisticated investment agencies or commodity/oil stabilisation funds to manage reserves – since there is a broader range of investment opportunities for their savings today than in the 1970s or 1980s. The management of such corpus may, in some cases, be entrusted to the central bank but with an appropriate mandate.  Usually, these stabilisation funds are established with one or more of the following objectives: insulate the budget and the economy from excess volatility in revenues; help monetary authorities to sterilise unwanted liquidity; build up savings for future generations; or use the money for economic and social development. In regard to oil funds, the transparency and disclosures standards appear to be lower than those for the official reserves but with some accountability.  An interesting question in this regard is the extent to which the windfall revenues can be equated with the large capital flows. While there could be a deceleration in the windfall revenues, the reserve accumulation due to large capital flows should reckon with the possibility of potential reversals and outflows in respect of the capital account. II.  Innovative ideas It is useful to explore some of the innovative ideas that have been put forward in the recent period for using reserves. First, in March 2006, Prof. Lawrence Summers while delivering the L. K. Jha Memorial Lecture in Mumbai, argued that the level of reserves in many countries far exceeded the traditional measures of reserve levels required to guard against a foreign exchange crisis. While expressing concern about the risk composition of the assets in which these reserves are invested, Prof. Summers suggested that it was time for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to think about how they could contribute to deployment of the reserves held by some of the major emerging markets. Prof. Summers suggested creation of an international facility by these two multilateral institutions, under which the countries could invest their excess reserves without taking domestic political responsibility for the process of investment decision and ultimate outcome. In turn, the modest fee charged by these two institutions could support the concessional and grant aspects of global development.  The proposal provides an option to a country holding reserves to place a part of them with the IMF/World Bank entities to operate, de facto, as external asset managers. The option could be exercised, presuming that it would be permissible, but not obligatory, to make placement of a part of the reserves if the envisaged entity could assure that it had the expertise to function as such an BIS Review 87/2006 3 
external asset manager and to provide a higher risk-weighted return than the domestic reserve managers. Further, since the external asset managers for reserve management in the market are usually guided by the parameters fixed by the official reserve management authorities, which may vary from country to country, the proposed entity may also have to have several windows to cater to the varied mixes of safety, liquidity and return preferred by various client countries. Thus, the critical issue would be the professional expertise of the proposed entity in terms of assuring an acceptable risk-reward equation. Second, there was a proposal in 2005 by Eswar Prasad and Raghuram Rajan of the IMF for a controlled approach to capital account liberalisation for economies experiencing large capital inflows. The proposal essentially involves securitising a portion of capital inflows through closed-ended mutual funds that issue shares in the domestic currency, use the proceeds to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank and then invest the foreign exchange so acquired, abroad. It is argued that such an arrangement would eliminate the fiscal costs of sterilising these inflows, provide the domestic investors opportunities for international portfolio diversification and stimulate the development of domestic financial markets; more importantly, it would allow central banks to control both, the timing and the quantity of capital outflows. It is advocated that this proposal could be a part of a broader toolkit of measures to liberalise the capital account cautiously when external circumstances are favourable.  The merit of this proposal is in combining three elements – capital account management, financial sector development and use of foreign exchange reserves. This proposal, for setting up more than closed-ended private-sector foreign- asset funds, to be licensed by the central bank, appears relevant under certain circumstances, mainly when there is a likelihood of a significant investor interest for such fund. This, however, does not seem realisable, if there is a negative carry that such funds could entail. Further, it is not certain whether a private intermediary licensed by a central bank specifically for this purpose would entirely obviate the moral hazard, even in the absence of any explicit or implicit guarantee with regard to performance.  In India, domestic mutual funds are permitted to invest in foreign securities, apart from ADR/GDR of Indian companies, up to an aggregate limit of USD two billion. In addition, a limited number of qualified mutual funds are also permitted to invest cumulatively up to USD one billion in overseas exchange traded funds (ETF). More generally, the pace and sequencing of several measures of liberalisation of capital account take into account the degree of comfort as one of the relevant factors. Third, an idea which received some attention in March 2002 during the gathering on ‘Finance for Development’ in Monterrey, Mexico, is that instead of holding the reserves in the US dollars, a new form of global money, akin to IMF's Special Drawing Rights, namely, ‘global greenbacks’ could be issued, which countries could hold in their reserves. The corpus would be created by countries setting aside a part of reserves every year as an insurance against contingencies. The amount of money held by these countries in ‘global greenbacks’ could be given to developing countries for financing their development programmes as well as global public goods like environmental projects, health initiatives, humanitarian assistance, and so on. For countries that receive less than the amount that they need to put into reserves, the new ‘global money’ would go into reserves freeing dollars that these countries would otherwise set aside. Countries that receive more than they must put into reserves, could exchange the new money for conventional currencies. Eventually, all the new money will find its way into reserves, which in effect represent a commitment by the countries to help each other in times of trouble.  It has been argued that the global greenbacks proposal envisages flow of funds to poor countries according to their need while contributing to global economic growth, stability and equity. Opponents of this move have argued that some countries will become “greenback addicts”, and when the handouts end, the economic withdrawal symptoms will be severe.  Fourth, in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis, two related developments took place. In the year 2000, ASEAN+3 countries mutually agreed to form a network of bilateral swap agreements to provide mutual protection from financial emergencies, popularly known as the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI). The success of such an initiative is reflected in the recent proposal of the Asian Finance Ministers to double the size of the Asian Central Bank Swaps under the CMI.  The Asian Bond Fund Initiative was also launched in 2003 reflecting the efforts to develop a regional bond market for catering to the medium- and long-term financing needs of the Asian economies. The Asian Bond Fund provided an arrangement for pooling of a portion of foreign exchange reserves of a few East Asia and Pacific countries and the Fund’s portfolio is invested in the liquid US dollar denominated bonds issued by the major Asian economies. The second ABF, launched in June 2005, 4 BIS Review 87/2006 
aims to promote local currency bond markets, by establishing a Pan-Asian Bond Index Fund (PAIF) and eight single-market funds (SMFs).  III. Degree of comfort  The concept of adequacy of reserves is popular but it is also possible, from a practitioner's perspective, to view reserves in terms of degree of comfort they provide at various levels. Such a perspective is more dynamic and contextual. Certainly, at a very low level of reserves, which we in India had in the early 1990s, the degree of comfort was very low, and with rising level of reserves, the comfort also increases. The level of comfort and discomfort could be linked to the problem of plenty and the problem of paucity – with a continuum representing different levels of comfort at various levels of reserves. For a country, it could happen that initially the degree of comfort with the level of reserves may be too low for sometime but with rising level of reserves, the country might reach a 'comfort zone', and as the reserves level keeps on rising to reach a still higher level, then at some point, a portion of the reserves would cease to be strictly ‘foreign exchange reserves’ and could be characterised as a corpus of funds available for deployment in a higher risk-return portfolio. Several factors, apart from the exchange rate regime, influence the comfort level in regard to reserves. Illustratively, they would include vulnerability to the real sector shocks, strength of the fiscal and financial sectors, current account balance, the changing composition of capital flows, a medium-term view of growth prospects encompassing business cycles, etc. In a sense, official reserves have to reflect the balancing and comforting factors relative to external assets and liabilities in the context of a rational balance sheet approach. IV.  Options linked to comfort Let me now link the availability of options with the degree of comfort. First, it may be useful, for practical purposes, to view the adequacy of reserves in terms of degree of comfort they offer at a given time.  Second, while considering the level of reserves and comfort derived there from, it will be necessary to take into account the investment and the stabilisation funds, if applicable. Further, transferability from official reserves to such funds and vice versa, and the extent of liquidity required, also need to be considered in assessing the comfort level. Third, relative emphasis on safety, liquidity and return keeps changing with the degree of comfort at a given level of reserves. Fourth, it must be noted that from a national balance sheet point of view, official reserves have to reflect the potential market infirmities in the private sector. So, if there are high returns derived from high risks assumed due to larger risk appetite of the external asset managers, then deploying official reserves too in the high-risk assets would exacerbate the risks. Official reserves may be needed as a cushion when markets get suddenly risk averse and hence, safety and liquidity should normally have higher orders of priority in the management of reserves. Fifth, it is possible for a central bank to have tranches – each tranche reflecting a different combination of safety, liquidity and return. Each tranche can be managed by the central bank or an external asset manager, or both, in parallel, to benchmark their relative performance. Finally, and above all, the criticality of the accountability in the use of reserves must be recognised. It is useful to note that the reserve management policies normally involve joint responsibility of the Government and the central bank – irrespective of in whose balance sheet they appear. V.  Concluding observations I would like to recall here what I had said in this regard In 2003, at the Annual Fund-Bank Meetings in Dubai:  "The reserve accumulation could also be seen in the context of the availability of abundant international liquidity following the easing of the monetary policy in industrial countries. The resultant excess liquidity flowed into the emerging BIS Review 87/2006 5 
markets. In the event of hardening of interest rates in industrialised countries, this liquidity may as quickly dry up; in that situation, emerging markets should have sufficient cushion to withstand such reverse flows of capital." Now, with the global rise in the interest rates, there is always a lurking fear in the EMEs, that the level of capital flows may not be maintained. Thus, the comfort level of reserves should not be viewed with respect to the current situation alone but should also reckon the assessment of the emerging risks. Moreover, at this moment, the global economy has not been tested on the eventuality of a not-so-orderly correction of the current global imbalances. In that eventuality, as the experts caution, disruption in financial markets in the form of large cross-currency volatility and sharp rise in interest rates are not unlikely in the global economy. To sum up, several factors impinge on the comfort level of reserves and the relative weights assigned to safety, liquidity and return. When, how and through whom should the search for higher returns be pursued, depending upon the level of comfort, is a matter of convenience and context, and options, as appropriate, should always be kept open.

The topic of the conference is economic prospects and I will of course provide my views on these. However, I will speak in fairly general terms – a more detailed analysis will be presented in the Riksbank’s Inflation Report, which is published at the end of October.  Before I move onto economic developments, however, I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about how monetary policy is conducted in Sweden in general, or the monetary policy strategy, as it is usually called. More specifically, I intend to take up some questions that have arisen in the discussions in the media and elsewhere as there still seems to be some confusion.  This applies in particular to the objective of monetary policy. Do we attach less importance to the inflation target now, or have we even introduced other objectives in addition to the inflation target? Let me emphasise right now that no such changes have been made. Our focus is on the inflation target and the central aim is to anchor inflation expectations in the economy around this target. However, when we formulate our monetary policy we also give consideration to the way the rest of the economy is developing. It is our reasoning on this that I intend to begin with.  The inflation target and consideration of the real economy The Riksbank has the statutory objective of maintaining a low and stable inflation rate, or of “maintaining price stability” as it is expressed in the Sveriges Riksbank Act. We have specified this task as ensuring that CPI inflation is around 2 per cent a year, with a tolerated deviation interval of +/- 1 one percentage point. As long as confidence in the inflation target is not threatened – or, as it is usually expressed, as long as the nominal anchor for setting prices and wages is not at risk – we also have the opportunity to take into consideration how the real economy, such as production and employment, develops.  Although the latter has not been written into the Act, it was stated in the preliminary work to the new Sveriges Riksbank Act that came into force in 1999 that it was natural that the Riksbank should support the economic policy objectives of sustainable growth and high employment without neglecting the long-term price stability objective. This was considered a natural consequence of the Riksbank being an authority under the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament). It was therefore considered unnecessary to specify any further objective than price stability in the law text. There were probably also some fears that statutory objectives for the real economy could give the wrong impression – that monetary policy could also govern long-term developments in growth and employment, for example. It is now widely accepted that these are determined by factors that are not directly affected by monetary policy, such as the rate of technological advances and the efficient functioning of various markets. In general terms, one can say that the policy conducted by the Riksbank is aimed partly at limiting the inevitable deviations from the inflation target and partly at ensuring that the real economy does not fluctuate excessively. The objective of monetary policy is price stability, but the Riksbank also considers real economy considerations to be important. This is characteristic of what is known as flexible inflation targeting, which as far as I know, is conducted by all central banks that have inflation targets. Monetary policy affects the economy with a certain time lag. Monetary policy decisions must therefore be based on forecasts of future inflation. Normally, monetary policy is aimed at achieving the inflation target within two years to avoid the deviations from target from being too large and too protracted. This two-year horizon can be regarded as a restriction that the Riksbank has placed upon itself as a means of upholding confidence in the inflation target. At the same time, it provides an opportunity to show consideration for the real economy. If, for instance, there is a shock that leads to inflation being pushed upwards despite weak demand, a very rapid return to the inflation target would entail large negative effects for the real economy – an even greater slowdown in the already weak demand – than if the recovery was allowed to occur at a slower pace. If inflation is instead held back despite good BIS Review 87/2006 1 
growth in demand, attempts to quickly return it to target through very expansionary monetary policy could lead to the economy overheating. Over time a policy that quickly subdues inflationary impulses would perhaps result in more stable inflation, but there would be substantial fluctuations in the real economy. We have chosen a two-year horizon for monetary policy because this is considered to give sufficient scope in most cases to ensure acceptable developments in the real economy. However, the rate at which it is desirable to bring inflation back on target depends on what shocks the economy has suffered and how substantial they are. Sometimes deviations from the target may be so substantial that there is reason to allow inflation to return to target beyond the normal two-year horizon and in this case we explain the reasons when we announce our decision. However, the ambition remains the same; that is, a desire to ensure that inflation is low and stable a few years ahead, while giving some consideration to the stability of the real economy. What significance do house prices and household indebtedness have? How do developments in house prices and household indebtedness come into the picture? House prices must be given consideration in the forecasts as they affect, through the wealth effects, households’ decisions regarding consumption and saving. The size of household debts is important to the way in which interest rate changes affect consumption.  However, one problem is that it can be difficult in the normal forecasting and analysis work to capture the risks that ensue from large fluctuations in house prices and other asset prices. One reason for this is that the models usually used to make forecasts do not have such sophisticated descriptions of the financial sector and its interplay with the real economy. The problems are particularly great when house prices and credit growth have over a long period developed in a manner that is not sustainable in the long term. It is simply not possible, with the analysis and forecasting tools currently available, to forecast with sufficient accuracy whether, for instance, there will be a sudden correction in house prices, or whether there will be a calmer, more protracted adjustment.  At the same time, the Riksbank must take into account the risks when conducting its monetary policy. If the rate of increase in house prices and household debts remains at a high level over a long period of time, the risk increases that imbalances will build up and will force an adjustment later on, which could in the worst case have significant consequences for the real economy and inflation. The way in which the Riksbank can manage this type of risk when making monetary policy decisions is, in principle, to make changes in the interest rate sooner or later than would otherwise be assessed as the most appropriate timing, given the “normal” forecasts for inflation and the real economy. It is hoped that such a policy will contribute to a smoother adjustment process for house prices and help to avoid a more abrupt correction.  One example of when this type of reasoning has been applied is at the monetary policy meeting in February. We then chose to raise the interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, which was also in line with market expectations, despite the fact that the forecasted inflation path showed the rate as being at the lower edge of the target margin two years ahead, and low for the majority of the forecast period. The inflation forecast as such could therefore have warranted delaying a few months before raising the rate.  It is important to realise that this type of decision with preventive interest rate changes does not mean the inflation target has been “downgraded” or that we now have a special target for house prices. The reason is that we believe it is the best way to safeguard that we have been set to safeguard – stable prices while avoiding large fluctuations in the real economy.  I do have some understanding for those who consider this type of consideration to mean that monetary policy becomes “discretionary”. This is of course true to some extent. However, at the same time I find it difficult to see that we should act in a different way when we are now, as far as I know for the first time since introducing the inflation target, experiencing a period when house prices and household indebtedness have developed in a way that raises concerns that monetary policy has been too expansionary. The important thing is that the Riksbank in these situations reports the motives for the decisions made as clearly as possible. However, the considerations are very difficult to make and it is not always possible to provide simple, precise explanations.  One might say, somewhat provocatively perhaps, that it appears as though many have interpreted our objective of maintaining price stability, or more generally, safeguarding confidence in the inflation 2 BIS Review 87/2006 
target as meaning that the Riksbank should conduct a policy where the inflation forecast always shows inflation as being on target two years ahead. However, this is an overly narrow interpretation and I am convinced that if we were to follow this principle in all situations the final result, seen over a long period of time, would be worse than with a policy that also gives consideration to other prevailing circumstances. In this context it can also be observed that, despite the debate that monetary policy has become less clear and that there is a risk that confidence in the inflation target will weaken, none of this is reflected in inflation expectations. These remain firmly anchored around 2 per cent.  Much of my reasoning here on the Riksbank’s monetary policy strategy is described in a booklet entitled “Monetary policy in Sweden”, which we published a few months ago1. The most important aim of this booklet is to explain how the Riksbank, when setting its interest rate, has scope to take into consideration developments in both inflation and in the real economy. One step in this direction was taken already back in 1999 when the clarification of monetary policy was published by the Executive Board for the purpose of explaining that the Riksbank conducted flexible inflation targeting2.  In the period since 1999 we have learned even more about how flexible inflation targeting is conducted. There has also been considerable progress in the academic research on this subject. New insights led to a decision to issue a new document on monetary policy strategy. This is essentially a question of developments and changes in the method of describing and communicating inflation targeting policy rather than in the basic strategy itself. Inflation in focus, not the interest rate Let me conclude this section of my speech with a few words on a concept that has been used in the discussions on monetary policy recently, namely that the Riksbank has begun a “normalisation” of the repo rate. The way the term ”normalise” is used in this context usually means that the policy rate is being increased after having been very low for a period, that is, it is simply a way of pointing out the natural direction for the policy rate in future.  At the same time, there is an implication in the term “normalise” that there is a level for the policy rate where it normally should be. Some analysts appear to have interpreted this to mean that the Riksbank’s increases in the repo rate point reflect that there is an end in itself to achieving such a "normal" level now that the economic upturn is well established and most curves are pointing upwards, quite regardless of how inflation may develop. However, this is not the way we reason.  The fact that the interest rate is below the "normal" level is not in itself a reason to increase the rate, even if real economic developments are favourable. It is not an argument that can stand for itself. The decisive factor for future interest rates is the result of our forecasts and assessments of inflation and economic developments as a whole. It may be the case, for instance, that different factors are expected to hold back inflation over a relatively long period of time and that there may thus be reason, even in an economic boom, to allow interest rates to “normalise” – if we are to use this term – at a slower rate than would otherwise be justified. In recent years weak growth in import prices and rapid productivity growth have been such factors. On the other hand, it may also be the case, if inflation is high and held up by special factors for a fairly long period of time, that interest rates must be maintained at a high level even when economic activity is not so strong.  This means that it is also very difficult in practice to determine what is a "normal” level for the policy rate. It is possible to use different methods to calculate an approximate interval for what can be regarded as a normal repo rate. However, this type of interval will of necessity be fairly broad – in a box in the June Inflation Report it was estimated at 3.5-5 per cent. Experiences also show that the repo rate can fall outside of this rather broad range for fairly long periods of time.  Given this, it can be observed that estimates of the normal level for the repo rate have a fairly limited value when assessing interest rate developments in the near future and that interest rate decisions cannot be justified merely because the repo rate is deviating from a level regarded as normal.                                                       1  See Monetary policy in Sweden”, Sveriges Riksbank, 2006 (can be downloaded as a file from the Riksbank's website, www.riksbank.com, or ordered in booklet form). 2  Memorandum “Riksbankens inflationsmål – förtydligande och utvärdering”, 4 February 1999, registration no. 1999-00351 DIR, or Heikensten, L., “The Riksbank’s inflation target – clarifications and evaluation” Sveriges Riksbank Quarterly Review No. 1, 1999.

Ultimately, it is the inflation forecast in relation to the target that decides monetary policy. How quickly the target should be attained is also decided by developments in the rest of the economy.  The economic situation Let me go on to say something about the monetary policy situation and the prospects for inflation and economic activity. It is the inflation assessment on which we based the decision to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points at our most recent monetary policy meeting on 29 August that I intend to discuss. An account of the discussion held at the meeting is contained in the separate minutes published last week. We observed in the Inflation Report published in June that economic activity in Sweden had strengthened, largely because of strong international developments, high productivity and expansionary monetary policy. Our assessment was that these factors would also continue to stimulate the economy. GDP growth this year was therefore expected to be high, which was supported by both the national accounts figures for the first quarter and the economic indicators for developments during the second quarter. There were also signals from the labour market that economic activity was continuing to improve, with an increasing demand for labour.  We could also note that inflation had begun to increase, after having been strikingly low. The high inflation rate was partly explained by rising energy prices, but prices of certain other goods had also been raised more quickly than before. Our assessment was that inflation would not change very much over the coming year and would then gradually increase as economic activity improved and there was a rise in the rate of wage increase. Our forecast was that inflation would be on target a couple of years ahead, on the assumption that monetary policy gradually became less expansionary in line with market expectations in June.  International statistics received over the summer indicate that economic prospects look more favourable now than we had assumed in June. The signals regarding the US economy are mixed, however, and some indicate that growth will be weaker than expected next year. However, the picture for the euro area and other parts of the world is that developments have been slightly stronger than assumed in our earlier forecasts.  With regard to the Swedish economy, the national accounts for the second quarter have confirmed our assessment in June that growth would remain strong. The statistics show that GDP growth during the second quarter was actually higher than our forecast. However, the development in the number of hours worked and the number of persons employed was weaker than expected, which reflected the fact that productivity growth had been much higher than anticipated. The new indicators received point to continued stable economic activity and to an improvement in the labour market in future. All in all, this indicates that growth will be higher than we had assumed in June, even taking into account the fact that expectations of repo rate increases have been adjusted upwards over the summer. The upward revision in growth prospects has not led to any major revision in our inflation assessment. Although the high GDP growth in itself indicates that inflation may rise more rapidly in future, the strong productivity growth is at the same time expected to contribute to cost pressures being lower this year than was assumed in June. Cost developments in the somewhat longer term are very difficult to assess. If productivity continues to develop strongly, companies may postpone recruiting new staff, which would mean a delay in the labour market upturn and continued low cost pressures. However, there are a number of indications that the labour market is now strengthening and a more rapid increase in employment will probably contribute to rising cost pressures in future.  During the summer inflation has been slightly higher than expected, which was mainly due to rising energy prices. The inflationary impulse this entails is to some extent counteracted by the low unit labour costs, but inflation this year will probably be slightly higher than we had assumed in our June forecast. Our assessment is that the effects of the energy prices will subside at the beginning of 2007. However, as with productivity growth, there is a risk that we are underestimating the effects – this could mean that energy prices may continue to rise and that there could be contagion effects pushing up inflation further ahead. During 2007 rising unit labour costs will provide an increasing contribution to inflation and a couple of years ahead underlying inflation is expected to be in line with the target, given a gradual increase in the repo rate.  Prospects for economic activity and inflation thus indicate that less expansionary monetary policy is called for in future. This will ensure that inflation is close to the target and that developments in the real 4 BIS Review 87/2006 
economy are balanced. Given this, we chose, in line with the repo rate path expected by the market, to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points at the monetary policy meeting in August. The assessment of the prospects for economic activity and inflation over the coming years that we made then showed it would be reasonable to also assume that the gradual repo rate increases will need to continue. I see no reason to change this assessment today. Thank you. BIS Review 87/2006 5 
Callum McCarthy: The challenge of Basel II for regulators Speech by Mr Callum McCarthy, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, at the Institute for Independent Business (IIB) Singapore Meeting, Singapore, 18 September 2006. *      *      * I am delighted to have been asked to speak at this meeting, and congratulate the IIB on establishing an audience so far away from its home base in New York.  It is a challenge to think what a UK regulator and supervisor should say to a US-based audience in Singapore – other than express mutual sympathy as to the effects of jet lag. I have chosen to talk briefly about selected aspects of Basel II – a subject which is both current and which raises interesting issues of international cooperation, the subject which I've addressed on previous IIB meetings. There is, of course, a continuity between my previous remarks on and interest in the issues of the responsibilities of home and host regulators and the implementation of Basel II. The implementation of Basel II represents a real, practical and important test of how regulators round the world are succeeding in working together. And I am afraid that the results are mixed rather than unambiguously good. This morning I want to examine some of the issues, and the extent to which we collectively have succeeded in resolving them. I should make clear at the start that I recognise that different regulators operate under very different legislative frameworks, and in very different political contexts. I am always struck by the enormous difference between the very strong political interest in Basel II shown in the US and that fact that it is not a political issue at all in the UK. And, while the British political (non) standing of Basel II is not repeated in all EU countries (there has been some political interest in Germany and Italy), as a generalisation it is clear that political interest in Basel II in Europe has been a pale shadow of that shown in the US. The obvious effect of this is the timing of implementation of Basel II, with the striking difference between the EU implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) in little over 3 months for the simpler approaches and 1 January 2008 for the advanced approaches, against the US timetable of 1 January 2009 - the first possible date a bank could start using the advanced approaches, subject to the capital floors. These differences in timing present significant but, by definition since they are timing differences, transient problems for international firms and banks which have substantial operations in jurisdictions which are adopting different timetables for implementation – particularly and obviously for EU banks with substantial US operations. There will be extra complexity, diversion of management attention, and costs. The consolation, if such exists, is that timing problems are temporary, and should in time be settled.  Of more serious impact – because not transient – are the questions of how bank regulators and supervisors in different jurisdictions, once they have converged on a timetable for implementation, will converge on interpretations of Basel II which are predictable and, in an ideal world, consistent. I want to set our some areas where we have made progress towards this end, and also some areas where we still need to make further progress. Within the EU, we have set out very explicitly how the responsibilities of home and host supervisor will be exercised in respect of model approval, for both IRB and AMA model applications – that is, for modelling both credit and operational risk. The principle was laid down in Article 129 of the CRD, and establishes the responsibility of the home supervisor to take the decision on model approval. It requires the home supervisor to consider the views of host supervisors on model approval, but establishes the right of the home supervisor to take the decision if agreement cannot be reached within six months. This principle has been fleshed out by work carried out in the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), which has agreed more detailed guidelines for both how home and host supervisors should cooperate, and exchange information; and for the practicalities of IRB and AMA model validation. Both sets of guidelines respect the primacy of the home regulator, while imposing duties as well as rights upon the home regulator. For home and host responsibilities extending outside the EU, the position is less clear cut. In the UK, our intention is that, where possible, banks should not have to maintain two sets of capital calculations for the same business. This means that, when we in the UK supervise a banking group with activities in other jurisdictions where Basel II has been introduced, we will not start with the presumption that the BIS Review 87/2006 1 
FSA interpretation must be applied throughout the group. Instead, we will seek to incorporate in our group assessment the judgments of regulators in other jurisdictions, provided that the scale of the group's activities in those jurisdictions is not so large that such a policy would be irresponsible; and provided that we have confidence in the regulators in those other jurisdictions. I would expect those conditions normally to be satisfied. That will be the position once timing differences have been eliminated. For the period during which implementation timetables differ, the position will be as follows. The differing implementation timetables as between the EU, US and other jurisdictions should not materially hamper a bank's ability to use the advanced approaches in the UK from 2008. Thus a UK group should be able to include advanced approaches for its US operations in its waiver application. Likewise, a UK firm that is part of a US banking group can apply to use advanced approaches in the UK, even though its home regulator will not have approved those approaches.  Since Basel I is not CRD-equivalent in respect of credit risk, as it will not always give a result that is at least the amount required under the Directive, we will not be able to allow a UK group to include the requirements of a US banking subsidiary as calculated under the existing US rules during the period 1 January 2008 and US Basel II implementation. We will however deem equivalent a scaled-up credit risk requirement to be CRD-equivalent if the US subsidiary in question falls into the 'well capitalized bank' category.  I think we have succeeded in establishing sensible, pragmatic and workable arrangements for Pillar 1 requirements and model validation. Pillar 2 questions are likely to prove more difficult. Pillar 2 was not conceived as a one size fits all measure. It was not designed to be formulaic or prescriptive. It is therefore quite possible that, in seeking to address similar risks not captured in Pillar 1, the application of Pillar 2 to two similar banks in two different jurisdictions could easily produce two very different outcomes. It is crucial therefore that supervisors and firms share a common understanding of the key characteristics that underpin Pillar 2. In Europe, CEBS has sought to do exactly this and has developed guidelines setting out a common understanding of what the supervisory review process under Pillar 2 should seek to achieve. But we have to recognise that much of this common understanding comprises a recognition, rather than an elimination, of differences. We will all understand better the different decisions which different EU regulators and supervisors will take – but banks will face the potential frustration of the same facts resulting in different decisions by different supervisors. It is an area of predictable sensitivity.  But it is not simply a matter of resolving some of these 'big ticket' home/host issues. Banks' chief risk officers are equally concerned by differing interpretations of key concepts and definitions used in different jurisdictions. Perhaps the most prominent of these relates to the divergent approaches to the definition of default that are emerging as between the US and other jurisdictions. This too is a predictable area of sensitivity. The Accord Implementation Group (AIG) under Nick le Pan's Chairmanship has been grappling with these and other issues, with some success, notably in the context of home-host information sharing and cooperation. But it is important that we continue to work at these issues, particularly on a trans-Atlantic basis. EU supervisors, all subject to the common discipline of the CRD, are of necessity succeeding in forging many EU-wide elements of convergence. The most important task for the AIG – and arguably for the Basel Committee – will be to develop global convergence. I am delighted – and relieved – that we have as Chairman of the Basel Committee my fellow panellist this morning, Nout Wellink of the DNB, whose experience and skills so clearly fit him for this important and difficult set of challenges. I hope it will give banks who are aware of these issues some comfort to learn that regulators and supervisors share your concern, and are working to develop solutions.  2 BIS Review 87/2006 
Y V Reddy: Asian perspective on growth – outlook for India Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the G30's International Banking Seminar, hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, Singapore, 18 September 2006.  *      *      * Distinguished friends, I am delighted to be here at the G30's International Banking Seminar hosted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Indeed, it is an honour and privilege to be amidst the global Gurus of financial world. I divide my humble presentation into five parts: namely the contours of Indian economy; the major challenges facing the Indian economy; the impact of global imbalances on India; some not easily quantifiable strengths of India and; India's growing economic relations with Asia. Contours of Indian economy • The Indian economy has been growing at an average annual growth rate of nearly 6 per cent since the 1980s, and at over 8 per cent during the last three years. A Draft Approach Paper to the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12) suggests that the economy can grow between 8 and 9 per cent per year. • India has also shown considerable resilience during the recent years and avoided adverse contagion impact of several shocks. • The inflation rate has been low and stable since the mid-1990s moderating to around 5 per cent per annum. The common intention of the Government and the Reserve Bank of India is to maintain annual inflation below 5 per cent in the medium term. • We see a consistent increase in gross domestic investment rate from 23.0 per cent of GDP in 2001-02 to 30.1 per cent in 2004-05. The gross domestic saving rate has also improved from 23.6 per cent to 29.1 per cent over the same period, contributed by a significant turn around in public sector saving.   • The productivity of capital use, as measured by the Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR), has been high by Asian standards and is showing downward trend reflecting improvement in productivity growth as well as more intensive use of existing capacity. This point to prospects for sustained high growth in future, given the existing level of investment in the economy, coupled with upward trend in domestic savings. • A noteworthy development during the recent years has been the continued recovery in manufacturing sector. This has been supported by domestic as well export demand, increased capacity utilization, augmentation of capacities and improvements in private business and consumer confidence.  • The services sector accounts for 60 per cent of GDP and has been growing at 9 per cent per annum since the mid-1990s, with potential for creating jobs and generating additional income.  • There has been a significant decline in the poverty ratio during the 1990s as reflected in the latest survey of 2004-05 by the National Sample Survey Organisation. The growth performance and potential augurs well for addressing concerns relating to disguised unemployment, seasonal unemployment and underemployment in the years ahead. • The fiscal position of the Government, both central and States, is undergoing consolidation in terms of targeted reduction in fiscal deficit indicators.  • The current account deficit (CAD) to GDP ratio has been moderate in India. The current account remained in surplus during 2001-02 to 2003-04, before turning into a modest deficit since then. It is expected to continue to be in the range of 2 to 3 per cent under the projected outlook of 8 to 9 per cent growth rate during the Eleventh Five Year Plan. India's foreign exchange reserves now stand roughly at US $ 165 billion and are well in excess of total external debt of the country. BIS Review 86/2006 1 
• The financial markets, especially the money, government securities and forex markets have been nurtured and developed in view of their critical role in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.  • The financial sector has acquired greater strength, efficiency and stability by the combined effect of competition, regulatory measures, policy environment and motivation among the market players including banks. • The workers enjoy considerable freedom of movement, expression and rights, especially through unionisation which, while making some changes difficult, ensures a vibrancy and timely improvisation to deal with competition. Major challenges for sustenance of Indian growth process • First, the poor state of the physical infrastructure, both in terms of quantity and quality. The most important issue here is regulatory framework which is being addressed by the Government. Technological developments and rapid enhancement of domestic construction capabilities should aid the process of speedy and efficient implementation. Given the healthy fundamentals of the domestic financial sector and the enhanced interest of foreign investors, funding should not pose any serious problem. One other concern has been the cost recovery, which is expected to improve with more public-private partnership. There are grounds for optimism for a medium term resolution of these issues. • Second, fiscal consolidation. The recent budget of the central government brings the consolidation on track, targeting a gross fiscal deficit of three per cent of GDP by 2009 while eliminating revenue (current) deficit. Our studies on State finances in Reserve Bank of India give grounds for optimism in regard to their fiscal health. We recognize two important areas which will result in fiscal empowerment. One is elimination of subsidies which are not appropriate, and elimination of tax exemptions, which are distortionary. While in any polity fiscal consolidation is hard, it is particularly so in our setting, but there are grounds for optimism. • Third, and perhaps the most challenging issue relates to development of agriculture. While over 60 per cent of the workforce is dependent on agriculture, the GDP growth generated from agriculture is only marginally above the rate of growth of the population, which is not adequate to ensure rapid poverty reduction. To facilitate a more rapid growth in agriculture, legislative, institutional and attitudinal changes to supplement enhanced public and private investment are needed. There is an increasing recognition of this issue among policy makers. • Fourth, there is a need to shift the emphasis to attracting foreign direct investment, which is less volatile. This requires a more favourable investment climate in general both for domestic and foreign capital. • Fifth, delivery of essential public services such as education and health to large parts of our population is a major institutional challenge. It is strongly felt that education will empower the poor to participate in the growth process and the large gaps in availability of health in terms of minimum access to the poor needs to be filled. • With rapid growth in manufacturing and services, a sudden and intense pressure has developed in regard to availability and quality of urban infrastructure and urban services. A notable beginning has been made in this direction with the launching of "National Urban Renewal Mission". Implications of global imbalances for India • India has not contributed either positively or negatively in terms of large current account surplus or large current account deficit; saving-investments have been by and large balanced; the economy is domestic demand driven and generally our policies, including exchange rate are market oriented. Thus, India has been following policies which not only served it well but also contributed to global stability.  2 BIS Review 86/2006 
• Any large and rapid adjustments in major currencies and related interest rates or current accounts of trading partners would impact the Indian economy though the impact on India may be less than many other emerging market economies.  • India does not depend on the international capital market for financing the fiscal deficit and consequently to some extent adverse consequences of the global developments would be muted. However, there could be a spill-over effect of global developments on domestic interest rates and thus on fisc also.  • Any abrupt adjustment in global imbalances may have some impact on the corporates, banks and households in India though their exposures, in aggregate, to external sector are not huge. With respect to the impact on corporates, if there is widening of spreads due to a shift in investor confidence in the international markets, those corporates which have borrowed at variable rates may possibly suffer more than those, which have taken loans on a fixed rate basis.  • Though, banks' exposure to the risky assets has been severely restricted by Reserve Bank’s regulatory actions, should there be a reversal of capital flows, asset prices may decline. Further, banks in India have invested significantly in government debt and other fixed income securities. If a rise in international rates gets reflected in domestic interest rates, banks will have to mark down the value of their investment portfolio. However, the banking sector has acquired some added strength to absorb such probable shocks, largely aided by regulatory actions. • As regards impact on the households, there is a risk that rise in interest rates in general could impact the housing market and expose the balance sheet of the households to interest rate risk, increasing the risk of loan losses for banks. The overall banking sector’s exposure to housing loans being relatively small, adverse developments may not have any systemic implications on the banking sector. Not easily quantifiable strengths • First, a vast pool of science and technology graduates and the millions who are familiar with English language are sources of strength for the emerging India so far. The familiarity with multiple languages in India prepares the people to adapt better to multi-cultural situations, making it easier for them to fit into international systems very smoothly. There is also recognition of the need to maintain and enhance quality of research and skills. • Second, impressive are the initiatives of many States for empowerment of women which defend their rights and help to gain greater self-esteem and control over their own personal lives and social relationships.  • Third, the existence of a free press provides some insurance against excesses and makes Governments at all levels more accountable than otherwise. The recently enacted Right to Information Act has contributed to credibility of transparency in public policies. Thus, Indian democracy and media are active and vital to our nation. • Fourth, the political climate is characterised by what may be termed as political system stability, despite the coalition cabinets and periodic elections both at the Centre and several States. As Michael Mandelbaum, a democracy expert at Johns Hopkins University in Washington said:  "There’s a lot of turmoil on the surface of Indian democracy, but there’s a lot of consensus deep down in the political system."  • Fifth, India will remain one of the youngest countries in the world in the next few decades. This "demographic dividend" is seen as an inevitable advantage provided prerequisites such as skill-upgradation and sound governance to realize it are put in place. More important, the demographic transition is likely to be stretched over a longer period since States in India are at different stages of such transition from Kerala to Uttar Pradesh.  • Sixth advantage is India’s business culture. In terms of business environment, the impressive growth coupled with market orientation of the economy has been a bottoms-up exercise, with a very broad-based growing entrepreneurial class. These tendencies are BIS Review 86/2006 3 
perhaps reflective of a penchant for innovation among growing entrepreneurial class in India, imbued with professionalism and seeking to be globally competitive. • Seventh, there is increasing enthusiasm amongst the provincial governments to attract foreign investment and hence we can hope that they will be keen to ensure physical infrastructure and good governance. Let me conclude with what Mr. Edward Luce who was with the Financial Times in India has to say about India in his latest book "Inspite of the Gods: The Rise of Modern India" "India is not on autopilot to greatness. But it would take an incompetent pilot to crash the plane" Economic relations with Asia • China and India are not only helping the global economy in producing low-cost goods and services but are also rapidly growing markets in their own right, with a huge demand for consumer and capital goods produced all over the world. In the context of on-going buoyancy in the Asian region and the increasing trade between developing countries, India's trade relation has undergone a significant structural change, with developing economies in general and Asia in particular, accounting for a major share of India's merchandise trade. In terms of non-oil imports, China has become the largest trading partner for us. • Asia accounts for nearly half of India's foreign trade, excluding oil imports and is growing. Exports to Asia accounted for 46 per cent of India's total exports, while non-oil imports from Asia accounted for 45 per cent of India's total non-oil imports during 2005-06. China has emerged as the third major export destination after US and UAE. India's total trade (merchandise exports and non-oil imports) with Asia has increased from US $ 29 billion in 2000-01 to US $ 91.5 billion in 2005-06, comprising exports at US $ 47.2 billion and non-oil import at US $ 44.3 billion. • Total trade with the ASEAN (exports plus non-oil imports) has increased manifold from US $ 6.7 billion in 2000-01 to US $ 21.1 billion in 2005-06. India's exports to the ASEAN region stood at US $ 10.5 billion and imports at US $ 10.6 billion during 2005-06.  • India has become a formal dialogue partner of ASEAN, and is keen to expand its participation in Southeast Asian and Asia-wide institutions. Similarly, India's trade with SAARC countries which presently stands at about at US $ 6.7 billion has vast scope to expand further. • In order to boost regional trade and investment, India has entered into comprehensive economic cooperation agreements/trade agreements with several countries including China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and regional blocks such as ASEAN. • Mr. Raymond Lim, Singapore's Minister of Transport and Second Minister of Foreign Affairs, in his article "Creating Globally Connected Asian Community" which appeared in the June 2006 issue of Finance and Development of the IMF notes:  "The rise of China and India will redefine regional divisions of labour and trade and help the Southeast Asian economies take off on a new and higher growth trajectory. China and India will bring Asia into the center of the global economy. ….. The rise of China and India is helping Asia to not only grow but to become more integrated." 4 BIS Review 86/2006 
Goh Chok Tong: Opportunities in a New Asia – China, India and ASEAN  in-between Speech Mr Goh Chok Tong, Senior Minister and Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) Opening Dinner, Singapore, 16 September 2006. *      *      * Let me bid you a warm welcome to Singapore. I hope that your stay here will not only be intellectually stimulating and professionally beneficial but also enjoyable and memorable. The IMF and World Bank meetings were last held in Asia in September 1997. A few months before the meetings in Hong Kong, the Asian Financial Crisis had started to erupt. The crisis swept across the region, causing immeasurable damage. Pundits declared the end of the East Asian growth miracle. But Asia has bounced back. Looking at East Asia through post-Crisis lens, a 2001 World Bank report "Rethinking the East Asian Miracle" noted that Asia was still: "...the most exciting development experience available to us...the Crisis has tarnished that record only slightly and, if anything, together with the strong recovery in several of the countries, may have reinforced the conclusion that there is something very special about these countries." Indeed, there is something special about Asia. Asia had problems, and will face big challenges ahead. But never in human history has the world seen such large-scale reduction in poverty and the rise in living standards for billions in so short a time. I am therefore confident about Asia's prospects. Over the next 20 years, Asia will continue to surge, led by the re-emergence of India and China, and a revitalised ASEAN. Japan, will remain an important player in Asia. However, as a mature economy, Japan is not expected to grow as fast as India and China. This evening, I will focus on India, China and ASEAN in-between. India on the march First, India. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on India's Independence Day this year that India is "certainly on the march". The Prime Minister is a modest man who is not given to exaggeration. Today, India is attracting attention from foreign investors and world leaders alike. Over the past 12 years, India grew by an average of 6.5% per year. Growth was even higher, at 8% per annum, over the last three years. I believe that India will continue to grow at a fast pace for two main reasons. First, in India, old mindsets are being tossed aside in favour of pragmatic policies supporting reform and liberalisation, and integration with the global economy. India's market reforms have stayed the course despite several changes of governments and Prime Ministers. Business leaders, too, are prepared to compete against foreign companies and foreign investors in India. Early this year, I met with the Chief Minister of West Bengal in Kolkata. The state has been under communist rule for 30 years. The Chief Minister, one of the politburo members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), was keen on foreign investments. He told me candidly he did not look at "the colour of investment - be it yellow, red or white". This reminded me of Deng Xiaoping's famous dictum: that the colour of a cat matters less than its ability to catch mice. The Indian communists had drawn lessons from the fate of other communist regimes - the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of China. They know they have to perform or perish. I believe that reform in India is irreversible, even though the pace may fluctuate. No matter which party comes to power, the government of the day will have to perform or perish. The Indian voters have BIS Review 86/2006 1 
seen how China, which was once just as poor, has raised the standard of living of its people. And they want their government to do the same for them. Second, India has many strengths, not least of which is a large pool of talent, including well-educated English-speaking professionals and workers. India has 300 universities and 1,500 research institutions. It produces over 200,000 engineers and 9,000 PhDs each year. It also has a young population. What will drive India forward is sheer hunger - not the hunger that comes from poverty but the hunger for knowledge and success. The drive and desire of young Indians to succeed is palpable - in top institutions like the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), or the Infosys campus in Bangalore. Young Members of Parliament whom I met were upbeat about India's future. Of course, India's growth trajectory will not be a straight line. Development across states will be uneven. Unlike China, power does not rest with one political party. The intricacies of coalition politics mean that time, patience, skill and political bargaining will be needed to balance different interests, and forge a national consensus on reforms. Investors have cited inadequate infrastructure, rigid regulations and bureaucracy as some of the impediments to India's rapid growth. In addition, India cannot grow into a major economy on services alone. It will have to find ways to expand its manufacturing sector to create jobs for the large numbers of young people entering the labour market each year.  India has decided to use Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to spearhead the growth of its manufacturing and export sectors. SEZs will create pockets of growth and prosperity. They will have a powerful demonstration effect on the rest of the economy. Foreign investors will find it easier and more attractive to locate their factories in an SEZ. Singapore and India have agreed to set up an SEZ in India and both sides are now working to implement it. China on the rise Let me now turn to China. I first visited China in 1971 to do business with them. It was during the height of the Cultural Revolution. I saw young Red Guards holding their study sessions in the open. I visited a commune and listened to an old woman singing praises of Chairman Mao and the Liberation. I have visited China regularly since then. I have seen China's transformation through the decades - not just the physical transformation but also the change in mindset and values of the people. Pop songs have replaced revolutionary songs. Gucci, Armani and other luxury brands are worn instead of Mao jackets. The communes have given way to industrial parks, like the Suzhou Industrial Park, an integrated township which Singapore helped build. And golf has become popular in China. Most analysts project China to continue to grow by 8% per year over the next 10 years. I share this optimism. However, we should not underestimate the immense challenges before China. The Chinese leaders certainly do not. Premier Wen Jiabao once explained to me the magnitude of China's problems through the concept of "division and multiplication". He said that China's resources become very small when divided by 1.3 billion people, while a small problem becomes huge when multiplied by 1.3 billion. Despite the tremendous changes, China is still underdeveloped and suffers from great imbalances in its development. Beijing's top priority now is to spread the fruits of development more widely. The government recognises the risks for the country if growth in the coastal provinces is not spread to the inland provinces. I believe that Chinese leaders have the capability and the will to do what is necessary to sustain China's growth and ensure political and social stability. Chinese leaders and officials, both in Beijing and the provinces, are pragmatic and in touch with the people. They understand the problems. They are prepared to learn from others, and they learn fast. One of Singapore's former Chief Planners, now working in the private sector, told me this. He had imparted Singapore's experience on town planning to some Chinese officials, while doing a planning project for the Chengdu government. Chengdu is the capital of Sichuan province, which has a population bigger than Germany's. Recently, these officials invited him back to do a critique of their strategic plan for an area many times bigger than Singapore. 2 BIS Review 86/2006 
He was astonished by the quality of their work - the depth of their research and the strength of their reasoning power. Those who have been to Shanghai or Beijing in the 80's and today will understand the point I am making. The speed with which the Chinese are learning and catching up is awesome. China will also face the trickier problem of managing the demand for political change and greater political participation as it becomes a middle income country. Nevertheless, I believe that the cohesiveness of Chinese society and the social contract between the government and people would remain in the foreseeable future. Communism may have failed worldwide but in China, the Communist Party of China (CPC) has succeeded in providing the people with security, stability and prospects for a better life. What the Chinese people fear most is chaos and a slide back to poverty. A revitalised ASEAN Third, ASEAN. Southeast Asia is strategically positioned between India and China. ASEAN does not regard the re-emergence of India and China as a threat. Instead, it is responding in a positive and strategic manner. ASEAN is positioning itself to borrow the strengths of these two giants to boost its growth. Some of you may have watched martial arts movies starring Jackie Chan or Jet Li. There is a movement in Tai Chi called to 'use four taels to deflect a thousand pounds' (  ). Using this movement, a smaller-built Tai Chi Master borrows the strength of his bigger sparring partners to achieve victory. ASEAN's total trade with China and India has grown significantly over the past decade, and in 2005 amounted to US$130 billion and US$22 billion respectively. ASEAN is working hard to ensure that Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with China and India are completed by 2010 and 2011 respectively. At the same time, ASEAN is also enhancing its links with other economic centres. ASEAN is negotiating FTAs with Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. To strengthen their longstanding economic ties, ASEAN and the US signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) in August. ASEAN is moving ahead with closer political, economic and security integration. ASEAN has set itself the goal of establishing an ASEAN Economic Community that will form a single production zone, with free flow of goods, services and investment. The original target date of 2020 was advanced to 2015 this year.  Obviously, there are practical difficulties of integration given the diversity in the region and the different levels of development. ASEAN leaders have tasked an Eminent Persons Group to come up with an ASEAN Charter to guide ASEAN's future development. This will mark a new phase of deeper ASEAN integration. Geo-strategic shifts The re-emergence of India and China, and the revitalisation of ASEAN are taking place within a broader geo-strategic context. Let me now examine some of the larger trends. At one level, Asia is slowly but surely coalescing. The entire region is being sewn together by changing patterns of trade, investment and production chains. Increasing economic integration is reflected by the rapid expansion of intra-Asia trade. From 34% in 1980, intra-Asian trade as a share of the region's total trade has grown to more than 50% in 2005. The transformations taking place in Asia are of a depth and scope historically unprecedented. The combined population of Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia and India is well over 3 billion, about half the world's population. Changes of the scale that are currently underway could be profoundly unsettling to international order. Strong growth will give Beijing and New Delhi the resources to pursue wider strategic interests across Asia and beyond. Strategic stability is not to be taken for granted, particularly in Asia where there are many territorial and other unresolved issues left over from historically complicated relationships. Great power competition and rivalry are facts of life. However, Asia has learnt from Europe that competition need not lead to conflict, and that conflict will destroy its dreams of a rising, prosperous region. The main challenge is to integrate all the key players within the evolving regional architecture. BIS Review 86/2006 3 
The US, with its economic and strategic preponderance, will continue to provide the overarching stability and balance in Asia. Most countries in Asia, including China and India, welcome a continued US presence. The key relationships that underpin the region's stability are fundamentally sound. In the post-Cold War era, US-China-Japan ties underpin the East Asian landscape. Today, while this strategic triangle remains valid, India's re-emergence has added a new dimension. Relations between the US and China are the most important, and basically sound. So long as there is no miscalculation over Taiwan, occasional tensions over trade, democracy and human rights can be managed. US and Japan are steady allies. The US' Security Alliance with Japan will continue to anchor its presence in East Asia and the Pacific. Relations between Beijing and Tokyo have been historically uneasy. There has never been a period in history when both China and Japan were simultaneously strong powers. As geographically close neighbours, they will have to learn to accommodate each other. US-India relations are nascent but on an upswing. Japan has also started to actively woo India. Relations between China and India have continued to improve. Many current discussions of Sino-Indian relations are based on a presumption of geopolitical rivalry. This premise is false. There is certainly an element of rivalry between China and India but India is not going to allow itself to be used to check and contain China. Both Chinese and Indian leaders want their two countries to have good relations. They believe that the world is large enough to accommodate the aspirations of both, plus of course, the US, Europe, ASEAN and other countries. ASEAN with more than 500 million people is large but it is not a country. It is an organisation of 10 countries. It does not threaten the interests of the major powers. That is why ASEAN has been able to provide a neutral venue to bring larger powers together. Placing ASEAN at the centre of the Asian construct helps to reconcile and assuage the tensions between major players and their competing interests. It is also the reason why ASEAN must remain in the driver's seat and the political underpinning for the multitude of dialogues and fora that ASEAN has spawned such as the ASEAN +3, ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit (EAS). The inaugural 16-member EAS was held last December. Major powers outside the grouping need not be worried that the EAS would work against their interests. It is in ASEAN's interest that the EAS remains open and inclusive. Conclusion Let me conclude. A rising new Asia will usher in a new era of opportunities for the world. It is therefore appropriate for the Institute of International Finance (IIF) to hold this meeting in Singapore, a gateway to access Asia. I hope that the next few days will provide all of you with fresh insights into Asia and Singapore. Thank you. 4 BIS Review 86/2006 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Switzerland and Singapore - small countries as platforms for global business Keynote address by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Swiss Business Association, Singapore, 18 September 2006. *      *      * Once in a while, the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank do not take place in Washington, as usual, but are held somewhere else in the world. The fact that we are meeting in Singapore this time is a welcome opportunity for me to return to the "City of the Lion". I am happy to be with you today and I would like to thank the Swiss Business Association and Ambassador Woker for hosting this Association lunch. For Swiss people, it is always a pleasure – even a delight – to spend time in this fascinating city. Since Singapore is often referred to as the "Switzerland of Asia" it is particularly interesting for them to make comparisons with their home country. As a matter of fact, I am one of some 50,000 Swiss who visit Singapore each year.1 Singapore is a unique place with its beautiful skyline, its outstanding location, its pulsating life, and – most of all – its openness to the world. Interestingly, Singapore and Switzerland share many common features. In particular, both of our countries have to deal with surrounding neighbours that are much larger and more powerful. Some believe this must make it harder to succeed in competition of any kind, but in fact the opposite is true. Let me show you why our position needn't be a disadvantage, but, on the contrary, an asset. Clichés are very hard to overcome. In the case of Switzerland, as you know, we are best known for our banks, watches, chocolate and cheese. Other than this, and despite the strong presence of Swiss multinationals abroad, the world doesn't usually take too much notice of what some regard as a "small village in the heart of Europe". In international surveys, we are largely ignored, and in European statistics we are almost non-existent. Sometimes this can be an advantage. However, in a more and more globalised world, it is rather the opposite. Success depends heavily on your marketing. So, let me show you some hidden aspects of Switzerland. You will see that modern Switzerland is adjusting rapidly to the changing reality of the world economy. Let's consider a few facts. A booming economy, at home and abroad With 7.5 million people, Switzerland is indeed a small country, surrounded by the economically powerful European Union. We have no natural resources, and contrary to Singapore, we do not even have a chance of gaining new territory by raising it out of the surrounding sea. Nevertheless, we have a highly developed economy and a GDP per capita that clearly exceeds the European average. Contrary to the situation among some of our neighbours, our population is still growing, thanks to immigration. Our foreign population now represents more than 20% of the total population and 25% of the labour force. Despite strong immigration, our unemployment rate – 3.1% – is relatively low. In recent years, our economy has been doing better than its neighbouring countries in terms of growth and employment. At probably close to 3% this year, our economic expansion is above our potential. Obviously, the fact that we are not a member of the European Union is no obstacle to our development. This is good news. However, Switzerland remains a slow-growing country – not only when compared to Singapore and other "East Asian Tigers". Our weak growth performance in the long run is due in part to full employment, the relatively high level of personal income and the limited scope for domestic investment. Like many other highly developed industrial nations, Switzerland is increasingly a producer of services. The flagship of our service industry is the financial sector, which expanded markedly in the 1990s and now accounts for 15% of our GDP – more than the machine tool industry and the chemical industry together. During the same period, however, the number of banks was reduced by half and the number                                                       1 Switzerland ranks fifth in terms of European visitor arrivals to Singapore, just behind France and the Netherlands. BIS Review 85/2006 1 
of bank employees has remained stable despite expanding financial activities. These figures show that our financial industry has been eager to react swiftly to the challenges posed by globalisation. Switzerland has a solid balance of payments position. Thanks to a large excess of savings over domestic investment, our current account surplus is constant and substantial. Contrary to popular belief, my country is not an importer of capital, but a net capital exporter. Our current account surplus represents 15% of our GDP, a level which can only be compared to that of some Asian countries like Singapore. In terms of labour market openness, another step will be achieved next year with the full liberalisation of labour markets between Switzerland and the traditional members of the EU. From our perspective, this is good news. We expect a new impetus to our labour markets. Europe will become even more important as a reservoir of skilled labour for Switzerland. The opening and integration of these markets is putting pressure on the wages in our country, which are traditionally high as compared to other countries. The position of Switzerland in Asia Large Swiss firms invest more money and create more jobs abroad than they do at home. Switzerland has become a major investor not only in Europe, but also here in Asia. Today, there are 4.2 million jobs in Switzerland, while 1.9 million people work abroad for Swiss firms. Apart from Singapore and Hong Kong, there is no other country where foreign investments exert this kind of leverage. This situation is the result of a long tradition of Swiss presence abroad. In Asia, Swiss direct investments amount to 35 billion Swiss francs, and Swiss firms employ 300,000 people, up 20% from 2000. In Singapore, to take an example, Switzerland is among the top European investors, ranking third after the UK and the Netherlands. The 250 Swiss companies here contribute 18% to total European investment in Singapore. Our trade relations with Singapore have developed rapidly in recent years. Since the late 1990s, total bilateral trade has increased by almost 50% to a new record of 1.9 billion Swiss francs last year. As a consequence of the rapid expansion of our trade with Asia, in general, and Singapore, in particular, the overall significance of Asian trade for us is now of the same magnitude as our trade with the United States. However, taking into account the relative size and the potential in Asia, there is still a lot of leeway for Swiss firms. A similar picture can be observed with respect to Swiss direct investment on the continent of Asia. Despite an increase of 30% between the late 1990s and 2004, Asia still only accounts for 7.7% of total Swiss investment abroad. Although Singapore commands the lion's share in this regard – 2.5% or 11 billion Swiss francs – it is evident that there is enormous potential for the expansion of bilateral economic relations between our two countries, and even more between Switzerland and other emerging Asian countries. For both historical and geographical reasons, our country is exposed to a considerable commercial risk in Europe, with 60% of our exports going to European countries. These European markets are no longer the most dynamic, nor will they become so in the future. Clearly, in recent years, the emerging economies in Asia have become one of the vibrant regions of the global economy. This is precisely why globalisation makes sense for an economy open to international markets, such as ours. Therefore, it is essential that we step up the diversification process so as to ensure the expansion of our export sector. It is in our own best interests to further strengthen economic relations with Asia. With our liberal philosophy and sound financial standing we have the necessary tools to pursue a policy of openness and enhance our strong presence abroad. Our monetary framework Switzerland is well-known for its stable monetary framework. Average inflation over the last 20 years has been 1.8%, and for the last 13 years, we have had price stability. We have never gone through monetary reforms as many European countries have done over the past few decades. Our monetary regime has been unchanged since 1973, when the peg to the US dollar was removed. Today, the Swiss franc is freely determined by market forces. As a representative of a country that has had floating exchange rates for over thirty years now, I can only underscore the importance of an exchange rate regime that reflects the realities of the market. During the past three decades, the 2 BIS Review 85/2006 
Swiss franc has been an essential factor in the development of the Swiss economy. However, it has never been a reason for our exporters to sit back and relax. On the contrary, the Swiss franc has put pressure on them to become more efficient and to specialise in those product areas in which we have a real competitive edge. Consumers have also profited from the strong Swiss franc in that the prices of imported goods have fallen significantly. A currency that is accurately priced enables the economy to benefit from improvements in its terms of trade triggered by productivity increases. That is why Switzerland is a firm believer in flexible exchange rates. Another advantage of a flexible Swiss franc is that changes in the international monetary system have little bearing on our currency, which is largely determined by economic realities in Switzerland. Consequently, the launch of the euro in 1999 – probably the most important event on the monetary scene in recent years – did not lead to the disappearance or the destabilisation of the franc as feared by some. Though the euro – to all intents and purposes – is accepted as a means of payment in Switzerland, there are not more euros in circulation now than there were French francs, German marks or Italian liras prior to monetary integration. Furthermore, the calm that has characterised the foreign exchange market in Europe since the disappearance of national currencies has mitigated speculative pressures on the franc. When the euro was launched, its exchange rate against the Swiss franc was 1.60; now it is only 1-2 cents below this rate – in other words, almost unchanged. On the whole, the euro has stabilised the monetary scene in Europe, and our currency is therefore less volatile than before. To be sure, floating rates still mean volatility, especially in the case of market disruption. At times, the Swiss franc has been pushed up to levels no longer compatible with the economic reality of our country’s fundamentals. However, these episodes have usually lasted for a limited period only. After September 11 and before the outbreak of the war in Iraq, the safe-haven function of the franc triggered a 10% appreciation in our currency against the euro. As a consequence, we pursued a more aggressive interest rate policy than the ECB in order to lower the attractiveness of our currency and give our economy some room for manoeuvre. Also, in the current business cycle, with a rapidly growing Swiss economy, we started lifting interest rates earlier than – and independently of – the ECB. In the last two years, we have already increased interest rates on six occasions. Contrary to the pessimistic assumption that the Swiss National Bank would be forced to shadow the policy of the European Central Bank, we have been able to set interest rates according to the needs of the Swiss economy. And we will continue to do so. Summing up, we are as happy as central bankers can be with the outcome of the test imposed by the change in the European monetary system. Why joining the EU and the euro is not a realistic option And what about the European issue? As you know, we are not a member of the European Union, nor do I foresee Switzerland joining the EU in the near future. The Swiss people remain sceptical about the efficiency of the Union and are very aware of what they stand to lose in terms of political rights and economic freedom in the event of integration. But our relationship with the EU is of key importance, since Europe accounts for two-thirds of our foreign trade, as I mentioned before. In order to secure our access to the European market and to avoid discrimination, we have concluded two packages of bilateral agreements with the Union – one in 2002 and one in 2004. The present situation – with free movement of goods, capital and labour, but without monetary and fiscal integration – is probably the best solution for us. In short, our relationship to Europe is well organised and established. At this point, one specific question often arises: If we are so well integrated, why don't we peg the franc to the euro instead of pursuing an independent monetary policy? Wouldn't this help eliminate the exchange rate risk, without giving up monetary flexibility entirely? The answer is that there is no certainty that a peg would engender the foreign exchange stability that exporters sometimes dream of. We have learned from our experience with flexible exchange rates that any explicit foreign exchange target stimulates the appetite of speculators instead of calming the situation. And this would be especially true if our pegging decision were to be taken unilaterally, without the prospect of a full and permanent integration into the euro area. Today, with global markets and global speculation, it is an illusion to believe that a central bank can defend a specific exchange rate target. The only exception would be if the economy whose currency serves as the peg were strongly convergent with the domestic economy. BIS Review 85/2006 3 
Furthermore, a nominal peg against the euro would do little to stabilise the real value of the Swiss franc – the only thing that matters for the international competitiveness of the Swiss economy – or to stabilise the franc vis-à-vis third currencies, especially the US dollar. Last but not least, Switzerland enjoys the lowest interest rates in Europe. This situation has nothing to do with the appeal of our bank secrecy, as many believe, but with the abundance of savings and the high degree of price stability. Since the introduction of the euro in 1999, the average interest rate on three-month Swiss franc deposits – 1.4% – has been less than half the rate for euro deposits. If Switzerland were to give up its monetary independence by pegging the franc to the euro or by joining the euro area, Swiss interest rates would increase to European levels. Since higher interest rates mean lower asset prices, lower levels of investment, and also higher mortgage rates, the Swiss are, understandably, not keen on giving up their national currency. A major decision of this kind would have to be approved in a public referendum in Switzerland; the prospect of EU and euro membership in the near future is thus highly unlikely. Conclusion Having chosen the option of free trade and free movement of capital, Switzerland is, in many respects, better prepared than others to take advantage of the greater opening of borders brought about by globalisation. To be sure, this is no easy ride, as international competition always necessitates painful adjustments, and Switzerland is no exception in this respect. Given our openness, we are immediately affected by a slowdown of the world economy. On the other hand, as in the current circumstances, we can take full advantage if worldwide business activity is healthy. When we take stock of the last few years, the bottom line looks favourable. However, we would certainly be in an even better position now if we had built up a stronger presence in emerging economies. Contrary to what some people believe, I am fully convinced that globalisation is not the cause of weak growth and unemployment in Switzerland; indeed the opposite is true. Foreign trade is the engine driving our economy. It has expanded in recent years in step with the global economy. By contrast, our domestic market has been much less dynamic and has registered only limited gains in productivity. In comparing Switzerland to Singapore the many similarities are evident. As small countries, both of us have simply no choice but to trade with the rest of the world, if we want to prosper. In many respects, we also face the same challenges: We have to adjust to a rapidly changing world, we have to remain competitive with our high technology products as well as our world-class services, and we have to focus on niche policies. In other words, we have no choice but to opt for excellence. 4 BIS Review 85/2006 
John Hurley: Prospects for productivity and growth in Ireland and the euro area  Opening statement of Mr John Hurley, Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Conference “Prospects for Productivity and Growth in Ireland and the euro area”, Dublin, 15 September 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to welcome you to this one-day conference on the Prospects for Productivity and Growth in Ireland and the euro area. I extend a special welcome to those who have come from abroad, in many cases travelling long distances. Today's event brings together a wide range of participants to discuss these important topics, not just academics and policy-makers but also representatives of commercial banks, international organisations, the public sector, industry groupings and economic commentators.  The day will be divided into two sessions, the first dealing with the Irish economy and the second with the euro-area economy. These sessions will begin with a number of presentations by invited speakers, including some of the Bank's economists, and will be based largely on the speaker's own research. After contributions from discussants, there will be an opportunity for a more general discussion of the issues. Of course, we do not expect that the conference will end with a consensus on all the issues. The conference topics are ones on which there can be quite a range of views and each of today's participants will naturally present their own particular analysis. However, I hope that, by the end of the day, most of you will feel this event has been useful and that it will stimulate further debate on matters that are of critical importance to Ireland and the wider euro area.  I would like to stress that this conference is about growth prospects over a number of years or even decades. It is not about what will happen in the next quarter, the interpretation of the latest data or any aspect of the conjunctural situation. It focuses instead on the medium to longer-term growth potential of the economies in question and the factors that will determine this potential over time. At the most basic level, these factors are the supply of labour and capital and the increasing efficiency with which these are used over time, that is, total factor productivity growth.  The evolution of each of these three individual components - labour, capital and productivity - is a very complex story in itself. For example, the supply of labour reflects developments in a range of underlying variables, not just demographic developments such as ageing and migration; it also includes behavioural aspects, such as the decision whether to participate in the labour force or not. The availability of a plentiful supply of labour, even a well-qualified labour force, does not in itself guarantee a favourable growth performance. It may be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for growth, as the Irish experience of the 1980s shows.  The supply of capital is another key element in an economy's growth potential, whether that reflects domestic capital accumulation or, as in Ireland's case, significant foreign direct investment inflows. Again, the story here is quite complex. It may be clear that rates of capital accumulation and, in some cases, the nature and composition of investment, is weak or unfavourable, particularly when compared with other economies. Often, however, the reasons for this are difficult to discern. Why, for example, does the application of information and communications technology in certain sectors of the US economy, such as retail distribution, seem to be noticeably greater than in Europe? The answers are not immediately clear. Even more intractable, perhaps, is the question of the determinants of total factor productivity growth. Certainly, it is likely that rising skill levels and the accumulating knowledge of how to apply new technologies more efficiently may account for much of this productivity growth. There are also other important factors involved, however, such as institutional factors that enhance the efficiency with which both capital and labour are deployed in an economy in response to all sorts of developments, including technological progress. In other words, the flexibility of an economy, and the institutional features that give rise to this flexibility are an important part of the picture. This is the type of analysis that underlies the Lisbon Strategy and the structural reform process in Europe generally. BIS Review 85/2006 1 
The importance of research in this area is clear. Productivity growth is the key driver of living standards in the long run. Over time, an economy's productivity growth performance will be a major determinant of both the absolute level of living standards in an economy and its relative ranking vis-à-vis other economies. The rationale behind this is fairly clear; in the long run, there has to be a fairly strong relationship between increases in output per head, the corresponding rise in incomes this generates and increases in the level of consumption.  How do the concepts of productivity and competitiveness relate to each other? These terms are often used interchangeably in public discussion. In a narrow sense, competitiveness is often about short-term developments, as measured by a range of various indicators, including, in particular, relative labour and other input costs. It is very important to pay attention to these variables. For instance, it is likely that sharp losses in competitiveness, stemming from exchange rate changes or excessive earnings growth domestically, could adversely impact on the traded goods sectors and cause damage that could take a long time to undo, through losses in market shares and the closure of firms. One has to distinguish this concern, however, from a concern about longer term developments.  Over a longer perspective, it is productivity growth that matters. By moving from the production of low-valued-added and low-productivity activities to higher value-added higher-productivity ones, facilitated by flexible markets and appropriate policies, an economy can increase its export earnings and its command over internationally traded goods and services. It can also benefit from the increased efficiency of production of non-traded goods and services. The alternative is simply to stick with low-valued activities and, typically in today's world, be faced with limited prospects, due to competition from lower cost production locations. One might be able to technically maintain competitiveness in such circumstances, but only by paring back labour earnings and domestic incomes. Clearly, this is not a very desirable long-term strategy.  It is evident, therefore, that a certain amount of structural change is a desirable feature in an economy. Ireland has undergone very high levels of structural change and the results have generally been beneficial. If we had simply tried to maintain the production structure of the past, with its greater concentration on lower-value added traditional activities, it is implausible to suggest that the economy could have performed in the manner that it has. In fact, Ireland tried to pursue this approach up until the late 1950s with unsatisfactory results. Further structural change will clearly continue to be required if we are to maintain and improve our relative position. The policies to be pursued, therefore, are ones that permit, or even encourage, structural change to occur on an ongoing basis and in as smooth a manner as possible. Determining what is important in terms of promoting productivity growth constitutes a key challenge for economic research. The importance of this topic has led the Bank to prioritise it as an area of research alongside the ongoing commitments of its research function to ECB activities. The Bank also sees itself as having a role to support the adoption of policies domestically that boost long-term sustainable growth, as well as contributing to research within the Eurosystem on this important topic. The first session today will deal with the domestic economy. It will commence with an overview paper followed by others relating to two specific topics that have been, and remain, key factors in this regard. These are foreign direct investment and the role of education in improving the quality of the labour force. Given the rather striking growth performance of the Irish economy in recent years, I hope that the discussion of the domestic economy will be of interest to all of you, including those who have travelled from abroad.  This is a particularly appropriate time to consider the prospects for overall growth and productivity performance for Ireland. The much-discussed era of exceptionally strong growth - representing a delayed catch-up process, if you like - is clearly behind us now. Growth still remains relatively robust by comparison with most other mature economies but it is running below the average rates of growth of the late 1990s. There are also a number of specific concerns, albeit some of a more short-term nature. In particular, growth has become somewhat unbalanced in recent years, with an unusually high reliance on the construction sector, combined with some deterioration in the economy's export performance. The productivity performance of the economy has also weakened, partly in response to this shift in the pattern of activity.  The second session of today's conference will focus on the wider euro-area economy and on its potential for growth. Unfortunately, developments in recent years point to a rather poor performance on a relative basis, in particular, in comparison with the US economy. Europe had been catching up on the US productivity performance over much of the latter part of the last century but, since about the mid-1990s, this process of convergence towards US living standards essentially stalled and, indeed, 2 BIS Review 85/2006 
has even reversed itself somewhat. This reflected a pick up in US productivity growth that was not emulated in Europe.  Measurement issues may play some role in explaining these differing trends. Measures of output in the US take greater account of quality changes, so that for any given value increase in investment or the output of the high-technology sectors, greater volume growth may tend to be recorded in the US. These measurement issues are not central to the argument, however. It is clear that, abstracting from them, the underlying story, though slightly less dramatic, is essentially unchanged.  An unusual feature of US developments has been the fact that productivity growth remained strong even during the downturn at the beginning of this decade. Typically, productivity performance is often poor in a downturn as output growth falls back but employment does not respond immediately. This performance was also recorded despite a peaking in information technology investment, but perhaps the impact of previous investment was only evident with a lag. In contrast, in Europe, the downturn saw further declines in productivity growth, although there has been some improvement recently. Possible explanations for these trends and the implications of their continuation will be central to the afternoon session. Clearly, the prospects for European productivity growth are very important, not least, because in the future population ageing will mean that each worker will be supporting more dependents.  Before concluding, I would like to say something about the links between the conference topics and central banking. There are a number of important ways in which monetary policy and potential output growth interact. For example, it is important for monetary policymakers to have a reasonably accurate estimate of the sustainable rate of growth of the economy, so that the stance of policy can be adjusted in a timely fashion to avoid inflationary pressures emerging in an economy. Equally, monetary policy can itself contribute to maximising potential output growth by maintaining price stability. Relative price movements and the required re-allocation of resources that they may indicate are important signals and they can be distorted against the background of unstable prices.  It is also important to recognise what monetary policy cannot achieve. Monetary policy cannot permanently raise output levels through adopting a stance that is too accommodating. This might increase demand in the short-term but it will ultimately hamper, rather than boost, the economy's growth potential and is likely to end in a damaging inflationary episode. In a specifically domestic setting, the Bank sees itself as having role in contributing to policy formation, specifically, by encouraging the adoption of policies that support long-term sustainable development. It can do so by sharing the results of its economic research and facilitating the discussion of important policy issues. Today's conference contributes to the Bank's overall efforts to meet its goals in this regard. In conclusion, I am looking forward to an interesting and stimulating discussion and exchange of views. I will now pass you over to the Bank's Assistant Director General, Tom O'Connell, who will act as chairman for today's sessions. BIS Review 85/2006 3 
Glenn Stevens: Risk and the financial system Remarks by Mr Glenn Stevens, Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, in response to the Distinguished Lecture by Mr Timothy F Geithner, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, co-organised by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Hong Kong Association of Banks, Hong Kong, 15 September 2006. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to be asked to speak in response to the distinguished lecture by Tim Geithner. As always, Tim’s remarks are at once thoughtful and thought-provoking, and contain much wisdom. In charting the evolution of the US and international capital markets over the nearly a decade since the Asian financial crisis, he notes the strengthening of the core banking system in terms of profitability and capital, the growth of securitisation and the development of a plethora of derivative instruments which allow finer unbundling and re-allocation of risk. A striking feature over the past several years has also been the way in which a succession of events which might previously have triggered a significant disturbance in financial markets have been absorbed relatively easily. There is no doubt that the core of the US financial system – the commercial banks and major investment houses – have done well in strengthening their balance sheets and developing risk management over this period. I could echo this for the banks in my own country, and I suspect that in a considerable number of other places the story is similar. It ought to be recorded, as well, that the long night for Japan’s banking system seems at long last to be over. But rather than celebrating this for too long, Tim points to issues for the future which go to the heart of the functioning of financial markets and the challenges with which regulators and policy-makers grapple. One of the biggest elements of the picture is the on-going growth of lightly regulated, often highly leveraged institutions, including hedge funds. Their record of rapid growth and high reported returns on average – with the odd period of very poor returns – has attracted a lot of attention by investors. Ten years ago, hedge funds were regarded as an exotic asset class, but now they are increasingly seen as part of the main stream for pension funds, university endowments and the like. Financial institutions are also increasingly in the habit of establishing in-house vehicles to tap the appetite for hedge-fund-type investments on the part of investors. Even some large privately owned non-financial companies operate internal investment funds that are, for all intents and purposes, hedge funds. Indeed, the very term ‘hedge fund’ seems to be used rather more loosely than it used to be: we are really talking about any investment vehicle which is willing and able to take advantage of the vast array of financial products, 24-hour trading and ample liquidity to expose the funds of sophisticated investors to virtually any conceivable type of risk. The growth of such funds is an aspect of globalisation – that process in which the national barriers to trade in goods, services and capital are eroded and in which economic and financial activity is increasingly organised on a trans-national basis. But like many aspects of the modern globalisation phenomenon, hedge funds leave people with mixed feelings. We could debate the merits or otherwise of hedge funds and other HLIs at length. Here in Hong Kong it would be, I suspect, a fairly robust discussion! Their defenders claim that, by exploiting (and thereby eliminating) pricing anomalies and by being less encumbered by prudential controls than most other financial institutions, hedge funds promote efficiency in the allocation of capital by searching out returns more effectively than others. On the assumption, moreover, that those who put money into hedge funds know what risks they are taking – which might, increasingly, be a big assumption – people might take the view that what investors do with their money is their own business. Critics, on the other hand, claim that hedge funds can overwhelm and distort small markets. A tendency for herd behaviour, and application of leverage, amplifies the problem, in the view of these critics. When hedge funds decide simultaneously to get into or out of a position, they can disrupt market functioning. Small countries, including Hong Kong, have on occasion felt as though hedge funds were singling them out for rough treatment, and that the resources available to hedge funds far exceed those of a small country seeking to maintain, for macroeconomic management reasons, a particular constellation of interest rates and exchange rates.  BIS Review 85/2006 1 
I suspect that both the supporters and the critics have, at times, overstated the arguments. But, in any event, like them or not, hedge funds and other leveraged entities are here to stay. For the most part, the entities in question are essentially those financial investment vehicles which are outside the normal prudential regulatory net. And the point is that there will always be some set of such entities. For if there is a certain degree of risk-taking behaviour that investors wish to engage in, they will find a way of doing it. If the regulatory net moves out, the activity will move beyond it. That, I believe, was a lesson hard learned in the regulated environment that prevailed in most countries for the bulk of the second half of the 20th century. It is certainly one I carry clearly in my mind from watching, early in my career, the heavily regulated Australian financial system of the time. My guess is that if hedge funds as we know them did not exist, or were regulated to behave differently, they would be invented under some other name. This has to colour the way we approach questions of regulation. Specifically, in relation to hedge funds, there are essentially two issues that regulators need to address: • The position of investors who are entrusting their money to these funds. In our view, this is essentially about ensuring there is sufficient disclosure to allow investors to make informed judgements about the risks and returns. In Australia, the regulatory authorities draw no distinction between hedge funds and other investment managers; the regulatory regime is determined by what the entity does, rather than what it is called. This ensures a level playing field.  • Ensuring that the activities of investment managers which are not subject to prudential supervision do not threaten the financial viability of firms, such as banks, that are. This approach emphasises to the counterparties of hedge funds and other HLIs (that is, the prime brokers, banks and investment houses) the importance of strong risk management, collateral, knowing their customers and so on. The aim here is to preserve the prudential strength of the core part of the system in the interests of economic financial stability, while allowing the part beyond the prudential net to play its role in taking on risk.  But such an approach, relying a good deal on market discipline, is not getting easier to implement. As Tim notes, the increasing complexity of the activities of various investors makes it hard for any one counterparty to know whether they really have a good understanding of their customers’ business (including with their competitors) and therefore their own exposures. Their direct exposures might be considerably smaller than the indirect ones, which will perhaps only come to light under conditions of duress. It is under abnormal conditions, when liquidity in markets is under pressure, that the leverage employed by some of the funds will be at its most damaging. It is at those moments that markets are most prone to freezing up, as all participants, wary of the unknown exposures of all others to the leveraged risk-takers, pull back. But this maintenance of liquidity and the smooth functioning of markets has become central to financial stability because even as regulated institutions have become more sound, they and other participants have come to rely more on markets for their own risk management. Hence dislocation can have serious consequences. I am sceptical, incidentally, of the argument that hedge funds and the like necessarily add to liquidity. Liquidity means being able to change a position without affecting the price, and depends on someone being prepared to make a price. Hedge fund activity adds turnover, which probably means that in good times there is more incentive for price makers. But under conditions of pressure, leveraged investors are more likely to need to use the liquidity of the market than to be able to contribute to it. On such occasions – which is when liquidity is needed most – these funds surely are liquidity takers, not providers. Additionally, there is, as Tim acknowledges quite clearly, an inherent conflict over certain time horizons between market discipline and competition for business. Precisely because hedge funds et al do add to turnover, they have considerable business to direct to financial intermediaries. When the money is flowing into the big funds, and returns have been high, they are more likely to be able to dictate the terms on which the various banks, investment banks, prime brokers and so on can get a share of that business. At those times, market discipline is likely to be eroded. In fact, this raises much broader issues of risk perception and management than hedge funds per se, and here Tim makes some very good points. In particular, the emphasis on tail events, and on the uncertainty which surrounds estimates of potential losses, is very well targeted. Risk management techniques need to extend beyond calculations of VARs and the like – as complex as such calculations already are – and to think about whether the possible size of losses associated with the 2 BIS Review 85/2006 
one-in-a hundred event really are well described by standard distributions drawn from recent history. They need also to contemplate the possibility that the correlations between portfolios will in the future be different from those in history.  This point takes on more importance, in my judgement, against the backdrop of the remarkably benign environment of the past decade in many countries. As Tim notes, a succession of financial events have been absorbed by capital markets with apparent equanimity. Simultaneously, macroeconomic performance in a number of industrial countries has been characterised by greater stability – the so-called ‘great moderation’. These two factors – macroeconomic stability and financial resilience to shocks – must surely be related, and will have been mutually reinforcing. It can plausibly be argued that risk genuinely has been lower, in some respects and to some extent, over that period.1  But behaviour adapts to the perception that economic risk is lower, often with the result that more risk is taken on in the financial structure. Lower macroeconomic volatility has surely been one factor, for example, encouraging a marked increase in the debt that households are content to carry in many countries. This has been most marked in the US and my own country but is apparent in a number of others, and that number will grow. If it has not made its way to Asia yet, it will before long. To be sure, financial innovation and competition have also been at work here on the supply side of the capital market – which means that we have to be wary of eroding credit standards – but that macroeconomic back-drop was critical. How households will behave under conditions of greater macroeconomic stress, which surely will one day occur, we cannot yet know. It is a fair bet, though, that the historical loss experiences in these types of lending, both directly and indirectly via business portfolios, are probably not a good guide to the future. More generally, a long period of interest rates being low and fairly steady, however well justified it might apparently be by short-term macroeconomic fundamentals, also causes behaviour to change. The search for yield eventually explores some fairly remote territory – be it more pension fund or retail money going into hedge funds, the rise of private equity funds, or the use of ever more exotic strategies by various managers to generate returns. The real question here is whether investors are consciously accepting higher risk in order to keep the sorts of nominal rates of return that were characteristic of a different era, or whether they are, in fact, not cognisant of the degree of risk they are taking on. Those and other issues remain for the future. I think Tim Geithner has put the spotlight on many of the right questions. It is up to supervisors and those charged with financial stability to try to foster a climate in which the risks are managed in a way which does not quench the competitive inventiveness of markets, but still secures resilience when, inevitably, more difficult times arrive.                                                       1 For an elaboration of this theme, see an earlier speech ‘Risk and the Macroeconomy’, available at http://www.rba.gov.au/Speeches/2006/sp_dg_270506.html.

Savenaca Narube: Following in the wake of Asia’s progress – are we being left behind? Summary of a speech by Mr Savenaca Narube, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the Pacific Economic Governance Agencies’ Seminar “Following in the Wake of Asia’s Progress – Are We Being Left Behind?”, at the Forum Secretariat, Suva, 1 June 2006. *      *      * 1.  Presentation outline • The presentation covers the economic performances of the Fiji and selected South Pacific island states and selected Asian economies. • The major challenges for Pacific Island countries are presented with the recommended solutions. 2.  Economic performances • Several factors affect the economic performance of small island states in the Pacific. These include smallness and isolation of the islands, globlisation and the gradual loss of preferential markets, weather and environmental factors, lack of capacity and political instability. • Two fundamental concerns are that economic growth is both volatile and low in Fiji and across other Pacific island countries. • Recently, some countries like Samoa have been raising their economic growth rates successfully, while others are still struggling. Compared to other Pacific Island economies, Fiji’s economic growth performance stands in the middle ground, not as high as Samoa’s and not as low as the Solomon Islands. When Fiji is benchmarked against selected Asian countries, it shows how far we have to go in order to catch up with these economies. • Using the UNDP’s Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure of the quality of life, Fiji ranks lower than both Tonga and Samoa. 3.  Asia has its own challenges • Asia comprises around one third of the world’s population. • Poverty is a result of such large populations which require sizeable economic development in order to create ample employment opportunities for the people. • Corruption is endemic and almost acceptable in Asia. Civil unrest can sometimes be the result of such an environment. • Pollution is a problem in Asia. Rising industries and technologies are having a detrimental effect on the environment. Natural disasters, while unavoidable, are a possible result of the degradation of the environment. • Close proximities to other Asian nations and the rest of the world has resulted in geopolitical problems. • Terrorism is a growing problem affecting both locals and visitors to the region. 4.  Factors affecting economic growth in the Pacific Islands • The smallness and isolation of the Pacific Islands are a challenge on its own. • Globalisation has opened up trading barriers and forced small nations to compete for a market for their goods and services internationally. BIS Review 84/2006 1 
• Weather and environment problems, beyond our control, hinder economic performances as disaster recoveries are costly. Rising sea levels, a result of global pollution, is a major issue that are already forcing islanders from their homes. • Capacity constraints in Pacific Islands include a lack of skills and resources, necessary for economic development. The migration of skilled workers, exacerbate these problems. • Political stability is required to ensure an environment conducive for investment. 5.  What is the single major challenge for Pacific Islands? • Pacific Islands need to lift their economic growth levels. • Growth must be sustainable and inclusive driven by private sector investment. • Long-term sustainable growth is the only way to create jobs, improve living standards and reduce poverty. • Millennium Developments Goals must be pursued actively. 6. How can we raise growth sustainably? • Private sector development is needed to become the engine for growth. There is currently too much reliance on Governments for direct investment and employment creation. • Private sector development can give our small island economies the sustainable platform that we need. • Such development can also in the long term ease the burden on governments. • Private sector development continues to be a challenge because of good governance issues, uncertainty of policy consistency by the government, poor infrastructure and the need for law and order. 7.  Role of the state • The role of state is to create an environment that encourages private sector development through appropriate policies, services and infrastructure. • They are responsible for the provision of public goods and social services. • “The best government is the least government”. It is ideal when employment is created by the private sector, not governments. 8.  Lesson from Asia – what else is needed? • Investment is the greatest hurdle. Raising investment by seeking out its impediments and removing them. To reach the average level of investment of developing countries, that is, 25 percent of GDP, Fiji needs an additional $400m in investment. • Economic growth cannot be lifted sustainably without reforms. The benefits of reforms include improved delivery of service, better allocation of resources and reduced tax payers’ burden. • A few challenges remain for Fiji given its smallness and vulnerability. a. Improving our exports level and base through diversification b. Improve our competitiveness through greater capacity utilisation and resource allocation c. Raising our productivity in order to improve our competitiveness d. Political stability has to be secured for a conducive investment climate. 2 BIS Review 84/2006 
e. Promoting micro, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) so that economic growth is more balanced and broad based. 9.  Summary • Pacific Island Countries continue to grow, but we need to lift growth into the future. • Private sector development will be key to raising our growth. • We also need to raise investment and productivity. • Macroeconomic stability has to be maintained in order for growth to be sustainable. There is room for micro, small and medium enterprise development. BIS Review 84/2006 3 
Mohd Razif bin Abd Kadir: Further development of the Islamic financial services industry in Malaysia Speech by Mr Mohd Razif bin Abd Kadir, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the official launch of HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., Kuala Lumpur, 12 September 2006. *      *      * Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim It is indeed an honour to be here this morning to commemorate the launching of HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. This occasion chalks up another accomplishment in the takaful industry in Malaysia, as we position ourselves towards achieving a dynamic, competitive and efficient Islamic financial system that is able to contribute to the overall development of our economy, and to enhance the integration of our Islamic financial system with the global market. The launching of HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. marks another significant milestone in terms of our strategy towards developing a progressive takaful industry, that is able to adapt to the increasingly challenging and competitive environment as well as adjust to the forces of change that has redefined the domestic and international financial landscape. Ladies and gentlemen, Over the past two decades, the takaful industry in Malaysia has grown progressively, underpinned by the holistic and pragmatic approach in the development of the Islamic financial industry. Indeed, we have witnessed an orderly development of the takaful industry. The takaful industry continues to exhibit good financial results each year, as reflected in the three-fold increase in total assets to RM6.5 billion in June 2006, as compared to RM1.9 billion five years ago. More significantly, average double-digit growth rate of 18.9% for net contributions of combined family and general takaful in the past three years, demonstrated the high potential of the industry. Whilst sustaining the current pace of development, there still exists high growth prospect for the takaful sector, in view of the large untapped potential, with the market penetration rate recorded at merely 6.1% in June 2006.  Ladies and gentlemen, Bank Negara Malaysia has laid down a number of initiatives to further enhance the competitiveness and growth momentum in the development of the takaful industry. These initiatives emphasised on enhancing operational efficiency, strengthening corporate governance and risk management as well as improving the market practices and consumer awareness. All players need to capitalize on these initiatives for the takaful industry to achieve sustainable success and unleash the potential gains of the Islamic finance in Malaysia and abroad.  Allow me to share some significant developments that may shape the future direction of the takaful industry moving forward. Firstly, as the prudential framework evolves towards a predominantly principle-based and risk-based regulatory approach, there will be a greater emphasis on risk management, corporate governance and transparency so as to maintain investor confidence and public trust. Commensurate with the diversity and complexity of takaful operational framework, products and services, the continuous upgrading of risk management practices, with improvements in governance standards and enhancements of information management systems will be critical. Under this environment, it is envisaged that takaful operators, individually or collectively, will play a bigger role in enhancing risk management practices, developing market conduct standards, fostering fair market practices and improving financial literacy among consumers. This will be even more important with the implementation of the risk-based regulatory regime, whereby the responsibility for the implementation of sound risk management and market conduct governance, as well as assessment of risks and management of the financial condition of a takaful operator, will rest increasingly with the Board of Directors and Senior Management of the takaful operators. Moving forward, a differentiated regulatory approach will increasingly be adopted, where companies that exhibit strong corporate governance and risk management practices will be given greater regulatory flexibility and may enjoy greater capital savings.  Secondly, it is vital to have in place an efficient and cost-effective delivery channel for the takaful business, strategically aligned to fulfil the participants' reasonable expectation. BIS Review 84/2006 1 
Bancatakaful strikes as an attractive value proposition that enables takaful operators to tap into banking institutions' large customer base and attract the existing clientele of the latter to have access to integrated financial service offerings in the most cost effective manner. Strategic alliance in the bancatakaful arrangement has indeed shown a significant improvement in the takaful contributions over the past few years. This is evident with the significant three-fold increase in contributions of the product marketed through bancatakaful in 2005 which accounted for 20.4% of total contributions. Bancatakaful has contributed considerably to the increased penetration in the family takaful business, especially for single contribution takaful plans. We envisage significant inroads in the penetration rate of bancatakaful in future years in line with the positive trend shown by the conventional counterparts, where the bancassurance captured 45.3% of the new life insurance business premiums generated in 2005. Through efficient cost structures of bancatakaful and with the entry of joint-venture takaful operators involving banks and savings institution with extensive nationwide branch network, the takaful industry should maximize the potential of this alternative distribution channel.  Finally, on the global front, Islamic finance has made significant inroads and has achieved growing global recognition. Another significant milestone in the progress of Islamic banking and finance as recently announced by Bank Negara Malaysia is the initiative to enhance the position of Malaysia as an international Islamic financial centre (MIFC). With the vibrant domestic Islamic financial industry that has become an integral component of the financial system, Malaysia is now well positioned to be an international centre of origination and issuance of Islamic financial instruments, fund and wealth management, Islamic financial activities in international currencies and takaful and retakaful businesses.  As at year 2005, the total gross contributions from takaful business outside Malaysia recorded an insignificant proportion of the total contributions of the industry. The relatively low participation of takaful operators in international business, is however set to change with the recently announced MIFC initiatives, to allow qualified local and foreign financial institutions to conduct the full range of Islamic banking and takaful businesses in foreign currencies. It was also announced in the recent budget that attractive tax packages in terms of 10 year tax holiday are given to all takaful operators on their international currencies takaful business. In addition, MIFC accords greater operational flexibility for the Islamic financial institutions to conduct Islamic financial services in foreign currencies from anywhere in Malaysia. To ensure effective delivery system under MIFC initiatives, the MIFC Executive Committee, with Bank Negara Malaysia as secretariat, has been set up to provide directions and drive implementation of policies and strategies to foster effectiveness and efficiency of the MIFC. Well capitalised and reputable financial institutions that possess sound track record are encouraged to set up international takaful operation in Malaysia to conduct out-out takaful and retakaful businesses. The Malaysian takaful operators should seize the opportunity to venture into out-out takaful business establishing an international currency business unit to offer takaful business in international currencies.  Ladies and gentlemen, In tandem with the rapid changes and expansion of the Islamic financial sector, it is vital for us to have a strong, continuous support in talent management and development. Towards this end, several initiatives in regards to sustaining and improving the level of expertise in the industry have been put in place. Earlier this year, Bank Negara Malaysia has launched the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF), an institute providing internationally recognised certification and programmes with the aspiration to strengthen the pool of specialists in Islamic finance. INCEIF offers an international professional certification programme for Islamic financial practitioners that includes a dedicated module on takaful. This complements Islamic Banking and Finance Institute Malaysia (IBFIM) and International Centre for Leadership in Finance (ICLIF) in providing adequate training at all levels to the industry players and technical programmes in Islamic finance. In addition, Bank Negara Malaysia has recently announced the Shariah Scholarship Award that is offered to local and foreign candidates to pursue post-graduate studies in the field of Shariah relating to fiqh muamalat (Islamic commercial jurisprudence) in recognised universities as well as to obtain the Certified Islamic Finance Professional offered by INCEIF. The Bank also offers Shariah Research Grant to research organisations and institutions of higher learning, both local and foreign, to undertake research in the areas of Shariah relating to Islamic finance, takaful and the Islamic capital market. All these initiatives are aimed to enhance the pool of talents, knowledge and research capacity in the field of Shariah relating to Islamic banking, takaful and the Islamic capital market.  2 BIS Review 84/2006 
Ladies and Gentlemen,  The growth and development that have been achieved thus far have provided takaful operators with greater opportunities or avenues to progress, both at domestic and international levels. HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. and HSBC Bank Malaysia Berhad, with the group's strong international network and experience, are well positioned to make Malaysia as their regional and global hub for Islamic banking and takaful. HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. should also leverage on the strengths of its shareholders i.e. HSBC, Jerneh Insurance Berhad and Employees Provident Fund, to further accelerate the growth of the takaful business. On this note, it is my pleasure to congratulate HSBC Insurance (Asia Pacific) Holdings Limited, Jerneh Asia Berhad, and EPF on this momentous occasion of the official launch of HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. I wish HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. every success in its endeavours and look forward to its contribution towards further development of the Islamic financial services industry in Malaysia. Dengan lafaz Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim, saya dengan sukacitanya merasmikan pelancaran HSBC Amanah Takaful (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. Terima kasih. BIS Review 84/2006 3 
Stefan Ingves: Financial crises in an international perspective  Speech by Mr Stefan Ingves, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, Copenhagen, 12 September 2006. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me here today. It is easy to forget what a financial crisis entails, now that a number of years have passed since we last experienced one and it is therefore important that we remind ourselves. Although we cannot yet see any immediate threats, we must look ahead to prevent potential crises. During my twenty minutes or so today I intend to talk about the following: • the fact that most of the various crises in different countries during the 1980s and 1990s have had a number of common causes, • the fact that it is important to invest in preventing and managing crises,  • the fact that risks and potential vulnerabilities in the financial system are now changing rapidly as the differences between banks and other financial institutions decline and cross-border integration intensifies, • the fact that the cooperation between authorities within and between countries must be developed further, both with regard to regular monitoring and crisis management. In particular, it is necessary to discuss how the responsibilities and costs should be divided up in the event of a crisis.  Many of the experiences I describe refer to crises and countries outside of Scandinavia, even outside of Europe, which does not prevent them from being relevant to our discussion. However, I will in some cases refer directly to the situation in the Nordic countries, with regard to the advantages and also the challenges presented by the far-reaching integration of our financial systems. Introduction An IMF study published a few years ago indicated around 130 financial crises in a fifteen-year period during the 1980s and 1990s; some countries were afflicted more than once. As we all know, we have also had our share of crises in the Nordic countries. Denmark has managed better than the other countries – you had no acute systemic crisis, but a few incidents where individual banks suffered major losses. Many international studies point to the large costs linked to crises – costs to individuals, companies and society as a whole, both direct financial costs and indirect social costs. For example, the crisis in Indonesia cost around 60 per cent of the country's annual GDP. A World Bank study shows that poverty combating in this country was reversed by twenty years. The conclusion is, of course, that it is very important to prevent crises and to manage crises in a way that minimises damage. In my earlier work at the IMF, I was directly involved in crisis management in several countries, but also in the prevention work. My assessment is that many countries have made considerable efforts in recent years to reduce the vulnerability of their financial systems. At the same time, much remains to be done, not least to meet the constant changes in the financial world. What gives me hope that this will really happen is that international pressure has increased – countries wishing to become full members of the global financial system are forced to at least live up to an international minimum standard. So which are the factors that lead to crises and how should they be dealt with? Experiences of crises in a large number of countries around the world It is possible to divide crises into those that only affect the financial sector and those where the financial sector forms part of – and aggravates – a broader economic crisis, as was the case in Sweden in the 1990s. The broader economic crises are usually based on untenable macroeconomic imbalances. Large deficits in central government finances or in the current account, unrealistic BIS Review 83/2006 1 
exchange rates or similar. One experience that Sweden shares with many other countries is that large and essentially desirable deregulation processes and other policy changes may lead to crises if they are not managed properly. The broader crises are more comprehensive and more difficult to resolve, partly because the possible solutions are not as clear-cut and entail weighing different social interests against one another. However, even the crises that specifically affect the financial sector, usually primarily the banks, often have their roots in weaknesses outside of the sector. These crises often result from a combination of "bad policies, bad banking and bad luck”. According to the studies made by, for instance IMF employees, bank crises have often been due to one or a combination of these factors: • A lack of competence in the banks, which has combined with weak regulation and supervision to lay a foundation for potential problems. This could be a question of inadequate credit granting policies, exaggerated confidence in loan collateral, an inability to detect risk concentrations.  • Criminal abuse of the banks, such as improper actions by owners and other insiders or "common criminals" such as Nick Leeson at Barings. • Malpractice by the authorities towards the banks, for instance non-commercially directed lending. • Many countries also suffer from their supervisory authorities lacking sufficient independence. The government becomes involved in the authority’s operational decisions and prevents the necessary measures from being implemented against problem banks. • Weaknesses in structural factors, such as laws and courts. There may also be flaws in the financial security net, for instance deposit guarantees or rules for closing down banks, which mean that the authorities postpone dealing with problems that have arisen for as long as possible. The crises can be aggravated and the solutions can become more severe and more expensive in some cases, for instance if the central government itself has poor finances or is bankrupt (Indonesia 1998). It then lacks the capacity to intervene with sufficient financial support measures to manage the crisis. If the country is strongly dollarised or has a currency board (Argentina 2001) or another form of fixed exchange rate regime, there is no possibility to take certain measures, such as supply the economy with a large amount of liquidity. Finally, I have seen that in the cases where the financial sector is large in relation to the rest of the economy (Thailand 1997), the negative contagion effects to society as a whole are much greater. How can one prevent financial crises? In my experience, much can be achieved if the authorities and the financial participants together draw up effective preventive measures and plans for good crisis management. One clear and positive conclusion from the crises in the past twenty years is that good crisis management can save large amounts of money and reduce disruptions to society. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that bad crisis management aggravates crises, partly by spreading uncertainty among the general public and the financial market agents. Good crisis management involves creating good laws, regulations and supervision. I have seen deficiencies in these fields in many countries. The legal framework may be insufficient, including the external conditions for good supervision, such as poor auditing and accounting. In some countries it is even possible to question whether a rule of law prevails there; that is to say, whether the laws are the ultimate guiding principle as to how the country is governed.  Managing a crisis also requires laws and regulations that enable a problem institution to be closed down quickly or managed in some other way. Sometimes it is necessary to take measures very quickly, perhaps even the same day. It is not possible to wait for the usual court process to be completed. To avoid this leading to any form of malpractice, the injured party should have the opportunity to obtain redress and damages afterwards. We had this kind of a law in Sweden during our financial crisis.  Another question is when a court should be allowed to stop important authority decisions intended to deal with acute bank problems, such as closing a problem bank. When a bank needs to be closed, a difficult balance arises, between the owners' interests and the savers' interest, which are both safeguarded in law. One very current example of this dilemma in Sweden is the case of Custodia. Both the country administrative court and Finansinspektionen (the Swedish financial supervisory 2 BIS Review 83/2006 
authority) have made their assessments on the basis of what they should take into account, that is to say the customers' interests and the company and owners' interests respectively. However, I feel that it is very unsatisfactory that we in Sweden do not have a clear legal framework that can manage this type of situation and I assume that these difficulties will quickly be repaired.  Crisis prevention also includes creating sufficiently strong public authorities. Unfortunately, one can see that the authorities in many countries have insufficient resources, independence and competence to match the often financially strong and rich in expertise financial institutions, whose owners can moreover all too easily gain the support of politicians against the supervisory authority’s demands for measures. This is of course a more serious weakness in a problem situation where a lack of measures, insufficient measures or delayed measures can aggravate the crisis. Another problem, although fortunately one we do not have in the Nordic countries, is harassment of the management and personnel within the public authorities for the purpose of reducing their ability and willingness to take supervisory measures against wrongdoing banks. In addition, it is important to establish clear roles and areas of responsibility between public authorities within the same country, between authorities in different countries and also between the authorities and the financial institutions. I have seen that in some countries it is unclear which authority makes the decisions, or which authority has the power to decide on a particular issue, because the law is unclear or because it is not followed in practice. This lack of clarity is accentuated in a crisis situation and hampers crisis management. This can be expressed in different ways, such as poor coordination between the authorities with regard to public statements and decisions or territorial conflicts arising and special interests being favoured over general solutions. If one wishes to detect problems in good time, before they develop into a crisis, it is important that the public authorities within a country and those in different countries can coordinate and exchange information. There have been large inadequacies in this field in previous crises. This can to some extent be blamed on confidentiality regulations, and the relevance of these may be questioned during a crisis, but in all honesty it can also be blamed in many cases on the authorities having insufficient interest in collaborating. Tendencies in the financial sector The financial sector is subject to rapid development. The borders between different financial activities are being eroded. Banks are selling insurance-like products and insurance companies are selling banking products. In some cases financial conglomerations are being established. Moreover, the trade in financial instruments has developed to such an extent that the risks are spread to a greater number of agents than before and also spread outside of the banks and insurance companies.  Another development is the cross-border integration, particularly in the Nordic countries. Danish banks have established themselves in Sweden and Swedish banks in Denmark. Integration as such is a positive development, for several reasons and not least to increase economic growth. The Riksbank therefore supports measures, for instance within the EU, that lead to greater integration. It is therefore important that the authorities manage the risks that integration might entail to avoid setbacks. In addition to the complications that follow on from an institution being established in several countries, supervision and risk management are made more difficult by the banking group sometimes choosing to manage the risks on a functional basis and not in accordance with the bank’s forma organisation. For example, a bank with operations in several countries can choose to locate all of its credit management to one country and its liquidity management to another country.  In general, this development strengthens financial stability. The capacity to identify, manage and reduce risks has increased. The institutions’ cross-border operations make them less dependent on how the economy of an individual country develops. However, at the same time a number of new possible problems arise, which must be prevented and managed by institutions and authorities. Risks and vulnerabilities may fall between different authorities’ or countries’ fields of responsibility and thereby may go unnoticed. Or, if they are noticed, territorial conflicts may arise, making it more difficult to implement the measures needed. It may also be unclear where the risks will end up. Bank supervision can ensure that the banks have sold certain risks, but it is not clear whether the buyers have the knowledge and financial strength to manage these risks. In the worst case scenario, the risk will return to the bank in a loss situation. The development I have described must be met with increased harmonisation of regulations and supervision, both between sectors and between countries. This has already been achieved to some BIS Review 83/2006 3 
extent within the EU, but it needs to be achieved on a global basis. Moreover, the coordination and exchange of information must be strengthened both in “peacetime” and during crises. Not surprisingly, I consider it important to implement regional financial stability analyses to detect possible vulnerabilities; the type of analyses now being made in the IMF-led exercise in the Nordic-Baltic region. Furthermore, both the institutions and the public authorities must gain greater knowledge of where the risks end up and what might happen if the ultimate risk-takers suffer problems.  The Nordic countries and the Baltic countries Financial integration has come a long way in the Nordic and Baltic countries. There is a close collaboration between the central banks and financial supervisory authorities in the Nordic countries. We have agreements on consultation in the event of crises and we hold joint crisis exercises. As Swedish banks play an important role in the Baltic countries, discussions are under way on the signing of a consultation agreement between the Swedish and Baltic authorities. One important weakness that remains is the unclear distribution of the financial costs between countries in the event of a crisis. A closely-linked but also unsolved issue is which country’s assessment of the situation will prevail and who may decide on measures such as closing a bank. Are the Danish taxpayers prepared to help pay to save Nordea’s operations in a crisis or do you see it as a problem for the Swedes alone? The question can be reversed, to ask how we Swedes would regard a crisis in Danske Bank.  These issues are not unique to our countries; they apply to all countries and therefore require wide-scale international management. This is a difficult but important issue to discuss – before the next crisis occurs. One means of making this issue more concrete could be to hold a new Nordic crisis exercise based on the conditions in a real bank. It would be necessary in this type of exercise to take a stand on the specific case, which in turn might make it easy to continue a general discussion.  Conclusion The crises during the 1980s and 1990s led to many important measures being taken: A number of international standards were adopted to create global minimum standards for regulation and supervision, for instance the Basel Committee’s Core Principles for effective banking supervision. The tasks of the IMF and the World Bank were increased to systematically identifying vulnerabilities in countries’ financial sectors, proposing measures to remedy them and giving technical assistance. The private agents in the financial market have also taken initiatives to reduce risks. They have, for instance, established the CLS Bank to reduce risks in foreign exchange trading. The banks and public authorities currently have a much better grasp of the risks in the financial sector and how these can be managed and reduced – this is probably part of the explanation why we have seen a clear decline in the number of bank crises in recent years. At the same time, the developments I have outlined above, including the creation of large financial groups and payment centres, lead to new types of risk that need to be managed. The consolidation on the part of the market must therefore be met with increased coordination on the part of regulations and public authorities. We do not need more regulation and supervision; the challenge is that regulation and supervision must always be adapted to development and, as now, aimed at detecting and remedying the most critical vulnerabilities in the financial system. This sounds obvious, but it is not so easy to achieve in practice. Commercial developments are rapid, while it always takes a little longer to adapt laws and public authorities, particularly if regulation and supervision are at the same time to be harmonised across national borders. From my work in various international forums, I know that the Danish authorities in general share my views on the importance of the issues I have mentioned today and I look forward to continued cooperation with you in various ways to prevent financial crises and thus avoid having to manage them together. 4 BIS Review 83/2006 
Ajith Nivard Cabraal: Standards, codes and rules – friend or foe of poor nations? Presentation by Mr Ajith Nivard Cabraal, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at the luncheon of the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting, Colombo, 12 September 2006. *      *      * Your Excellencies, Honourable Ministers, Distinguished Delegates, Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, it is my great pleasure to welcome all of you to Sri Lanka and to host this Luncheon today. I hope all of you had a pleasant journey and have been able to settle down well in our city so as to be ready to face the rigours of the tight programme that is ahead of you over the next few days. I am also delighted that I have the opportunity to speak to you this afternoon, knowing that it has provided me the platform to share some thoughts with a very diverse group that constitutes the Commonwealth. As we all know, the family of Commonwealth countries is a truly global, multi-ethnic, multi-religious, multi-cultural, multi-national collection of vastly differing economies, societies and political ideologies. It may also be not inappropriate to state that the Commonwealth is enriched greatly by this diversity. At the same time, we have to be mindful that the countries within this group are at various stages of economic development, ranging from poor developing nations with annual per capita incomes of about US Dollars 160 to very wealthy industrialized nations with per capita incomes of about US Dollars 36,000. Hence, although we may, in general, say that we derive our strength through diversity, we still have to take serious note that the great disparity in living standards is an issue that needs to be uppermost in our minds if we are to move forward in harmony and brotherhood. In that context, I think it is very appropriate that, this year, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers have decided to focus on several dimensions and options that impact on this issue, which is borne out of the fact that they have selected “Agenda for growth and livelihood”, as this year’s theme for the meeting. Your Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,  In order to critically examine the issue of wealth disparity in perspective, let us take our minds back to the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Singapore in the year 1971. At that meeting, the declaration of Commonwealth Principles was adopted. These Principles acknowledged that wide disparities in wealth existed between different sections of mankind. The Heads of Government also acknowledged that such disparities were too great to be tolerated and that such disparities would create world tension. Accordingly, the Commonwealth resolved to work towards the progressive reduction of these disparities. The same declaration undertook to steer the group’s efforts to overcome poverty, ignorance and disease, as well as to raise standards of life and achieve a more equitable international society. 20 years later, in 1991, the Harare Declaration was issued. This declaration conceded that many Commonwealth countries were still poor and that they faced acute problems, including excessive population growth, continuation of poverty, debt burdens and environmental degradation. At the same time, it was acknowledged that while disparities among members appeared to have worsened, some favourable results were also being achieved. For example, despite the widening economic gap, many nations had been able to establish better democratic processes, good administrative frameworks, more independent judiciaries, keener respect for human, fundamental and labour rights, and several other social successes. Those were of course significant achievements, and we should all be proud that we have been able to create such conditions in our countries. Notwithstanding those gains as noted in 1991, and the many subsequent successes, we may still have to admit that our collective efforts to address one of the fundamental Principles of the Singapore Declaration, namely, that of addressing the issue of income disparity, has been, by and large, unsuccessful. Today, 35 years after the Singapore Declaration, it is actually becoming even more acute, and consequently, we need to respond to that widening gap appropriately, urgently. Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests,  As we all know, countries that are affluent today were not affluent at some point in time in their history. However, they have reached an affluent status today through their various actions and initiatives. Obviously therefore, as in the case of any successful outcome, we could learn from those case BIS Review 83/2006 1 
studies. In fact, we in Sri Lanka felt that we should do so professionally and objectively. We began by examining the economic and political environments in which many of the highly successful countries operated. We studied the external and internal conditions that prevailed during the early days of growth of those countries. We also attempted to analyze the factors which enabled those countries to break the shackles and reach a stable platform from where they launched themselves to the next level of development.  In that exercise, one of our key findings was that, in the journey to reach developed and industrialized country status, many of those countries had immense space and flexibility to grow in an uninhibited environment. Further, when the present day rich countries were growing, (from per capita income of US dollars 1,000 to US dollars 10,000), they faced very few obstacles in the movement of capital and labour. They did not have to be overly concerned about human or labour rights. They were free to impose trade quotas and grant very visible and obvious subsidies to their local entrepreneurs and farmers. They were not subjected to stringent global standards for copyrights. They were not desperately worried about safeguarding the ozone layer or the environment. They did not have to make too much of a fuss about money laundering. They did not spend expensive professional time and money on compliance tests. They did not have to deal with 24 x 7 media reports. The list goes on. Some even had ready access to the natural and human resources of other countries, which they ruled.   But today, many low-income countries, despite their potential to grow are functioning in an “international environment” that is “controlling” almost all economic activities. Accordingly, they are seriously constrained by these stringent benchmarks, however wonderful they may be, which from a rapid development point of view, poses serious and continuous challenges. For example, at a time when these countries are desperately attempting to break free from the poverty trap, the allocation of resources to them by way of aid inflows by wealthy nations have been reducing. In fact, the net official resource inflows to developing countries were negative in 2005 and projected to remain negative in the next few years as well. In the meantime, although the Commonwealth group supported the Doha Declaration of WTO and were moving towards the direction of freest possible flow of multilateral trade on terms fair and equitable to all, while taking account of the special requirements of developing countries, the current multilateral trade negotiations have not been moving in the right direction. Hence, it is clear that not only are the present day poor nations struggling in the emerging, highly complex and controlled economic environment, they are also facing reduced resource transfers, and not being accorded special treatment they should be afforded in order to propel them out of poverty. Some may however argue that the tremendous benefits of globalization has levelled the playing field and that advantages are available to any and all who care to access, and it is just unfortunate if some persons are unable to take advantage of these conditions.  Nevertheless, I believe we are all aware that weaker communities have lesser chances of access and that situation leads to widening even further, the ever-widening gap. Therefore, it is timely and appropriate that this forum addresses the need to impress upon the more wealthy nations to increase aid flows, open out greater trading opportunities, and move towards higher investment and resource build-up in the lower income countries. Lest I be misunderstood, let me add that, not for a moment am I suggesting that the progressive steps the world and the international community have taken over the past few decades in developing new standards and norms are in any way, inappropriate or unwelcome. Those initiatives were certainly necessary and have been beneficial for the overall advancement of society. But, we must, at the same time, collectively address the ever growing constraints arising out of the inflexibilities and restrictions imposed in the transfer of capital, wealth, skills, knowledge and the imposition of new standards, which may consciously or unconsciously act as subtle barriers to poverty alleviation. Your Excellencies, Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Guests,  In order for all of us to appreciate the fact that what I am saying is not something new, let me now quote a Principle as set out in the Singapore Declaration, and affirmed in Harare.  “Our aim is to achieve the freest possible flow of international trade on terms fair and equitable to all, taking into account the special requirements of the developing countries, and to encourage the flow of adequate resources, including governmental and private resources, to the developing countries, bearing in mind the importance of doing this in true spirit of partnership, and of establishing for this purpose in the developing countries, conditions which are conducive to sustained investment and growth”. 2 BIS Review 83/2006 
While this Principle enunciates a very laudable and noble philosophy the unfortunate reality may be that the plethora of what we may call “worthy restrictions”, (albeit they may be for the greater good of mankind), may be actually but unwittingly assisting to keep the same developing countries in a tighter trap of poverty. The powerful message that emerges from this situation is clear. The present low-income countries, when they have to struggle in this unsympathetic environment, need more understanding; greater allocations for funding and investment; increased direct aid flows; and tangible support and direct concessions to recognize satisfactory “compliance”.  At this stage, I would like to acknowledge a step in the right direction that has been followed by some advanced countries through certain targeted schemes, such as the GSP+ scheme, which provides some welcome relief to low-income countries. Unfortunately however, even such concessions are often coupled with stringent criteria such as Rules of Origin which again adds to the ever growing list of “do’s and don’ts”, which list must be quite a nightmare for those who have to keep track of these! Of course all this has served to create a new breed of corporate executives titled, “Compliance Officers” (CO’s), who may at this rate, soon end up becoming even more important than CEO’s!! Your Excellencies, Honorable Ministers, Distinguished Guests,  The Principle in relation to addressing income and wealth disparity among nations is equally applicable to societies within nations as well. Towards that end, I am pleased to announce to this distinguished audience that Sri Lanka has already developed a comprehensive policy framework “Mahinda Chintana”, based on the election manifesto submitted by President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the last Presidential Elections which addresses this issue comprehensively. This policy framework provides a sustainable development strategy designed to address growth and livelihood issues, while covering the income – disparity issue that prevails in our own country. As per the “Mahinda Chintana” development strategy, every endeavour is to be made to tap domestic resources for investment. At the same time, the Government clearly realizes that it is imperative to encourage large scale investment flows into the country to make a significant impact in the acceleration of the growth process. It is now an accepted norm that large infrastructure projects such as highways, railways, airports, ports and power projects not only add to the stock of investment in a country, but are also considered a better recipe for poverty alleviation rather than income support and subsidies. A large number of such investment opportunities now exists in Sri Lanka and no doubt in many other Commonwealth countries as well. In that context, we need to use the opportunities provided by events such as today’s meeting to establish bi-lateral relationships leading to the promotion of investments. While Governments attempt to achieve consensus for multi-lateral facilities and agreements, it may also be time for individuals to seriously consider B2B investment opportunities.  Your Excellencies, Distinguished Guests, I am confident that the delegates present at this Forum will actively, seriously and diligently explore possible ways and means of promoting interactive growth that would generate livelihoods and reduce poverty in our respective countries. If we all do that successfully, we could look back and proclaim that we did our bit to fulfill the lofty outcomes as envisaged in the 1971 Singapore Declaration. Thank you. BIS Review 83/2006 3 
Donald L Kohn: Evolution of retail payments and the role of the Federal Reserve  Remarks by Mr Donald L Kohn, Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Western Payments Alliance 2006 Payments Symposium, Las Vegas, Nevada, 11 September 2006.  *      *      * I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak at this symposium examining the continuing convergence of paper and electronic payments. Today marks the fifth anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States. On that day, as our nation came to grips with the terrible events it had just witnessed, the Federal Reserve remained open and operating, in part to help ensure that the nation’s payments system continued to function. In the aftermath of the attacks, the financial industry has taken many steps to strengthen the resilience of our nation’s critical payments infrastructures. For the retail payments system, the September 11th attacks highlighted the banking industry's extensive reliance on air transportation as planes came to a standstill and the collection of checks slowed dramatically. This prompted a heightened focus on how electronic processing technologies could be applied to the check-collection system to reduce the reliance on air transportation and improve check-processing efficiency more generally. My remarks today, which reflect my own thoughts and not necessarily those of the other members of the Federal Reserve Board, will focus on the future of the check-collection system and the future role of the Federal Reserve in retail payments services.1  A period of transition in the retail payments system Today, shifts in consumer behavior and rapid industry innovation, along with legal and regulatory change, are dramatically reshaping our retail payments system. Because of the increasing availability and declining cost of convenient electronic payment alternatives, many payments that were until recently being made in paper form are today being made electronically. In addition, new electronic technologies are now being harnessed to improve the processing of checks. The 2003 Federal Reserve study on the use of retail payment instruments revealed dramatic changes in consumer behavior. It found that, for the first time ever, the number of electronic payments in the United States - such as credit card, debit card, and automated clearinghouse (ACH) payments - exceeded check payments. A range of data indicates that electronic payments have continued to increase and that check payments have continued to decline. Debit cards, primarily used by consumers for everyday purchases, are the fastest growing segment of the retail payments system. Consumers seem to view debit cards as a natural progression from cash and checks because they are a convenient electronic means of making payments without incurring the additional debt often associated with credit card use. In fact, on at least one major network, debit card payments are reported to have surpassed credit card payments. This shift in payment behavior can be attributed in part to changes in the rules and regulations governing the ACH network, which have facilitated the use of this network for one-time, nonrecurring payments. As you know, in the past the ACH was used mainly for recurring payments, such as payroll and mortgage payments. Today, consumer purchases at stores, over the telephone, and on the Internet can be completed using the ACH. Regulatory and rule changes have also facilitated the use of the ACH to convert checks that consumers mail to businesses or provide at the point of sale into electronic payments. These new uses of the ACH for one-time payments have driven the continuing double-digit growth rates of ACH transaction volume. Given these dynamic changes in the payments system, the Federal Reserve is planning to repeat its triennial survey of retail payments use next year to take another snapshot of the nation’s retail payments system.                                                       1  Helena L. Tenenholtz and Jeffrey S. H. Yeganeh, of the Board’s staff, contributed to this speech. BIS Review 83/2006 1 
The Federal Reserve’s experience with Check 21 Not only are more payments being made electronically, but more check payments are also being processed electronically, in part because of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, or Check 21.2 Clearly, Check 21 has begun to diminish the importance of geography and physical transportation in check processing, and banks have started to reengineer their backroom processes to accommodate end-to-end electronic check clearing.  Since October 28, 2004, the date Check 21 took effect, the Reserve Banks’ Check 21 volume has grown rapidly, reflecting a trend that will lead to the widespread electronic processing of checks in the not-too-distant future. Private-sector service providers that offer Check 21 services are also experiencing rapid growth in volume as the banking industry becomes more interested in and capable of using Check 21 authority to clear checks. Today, about 17 percent of the checks deposited with the Federal Reserve Banks, or slightly over 6 million checks a day valued at about $20 billion, are deposited using the Reserve Banks’ Check 21 product suite. As expected, depository institutions have been somewhat slower in agreeing to accept their check presentments electronically because of the complexity of integrating such presentments into back-office processing and risk-management systems. As a result, the use of substitute checks is widespread. Nevertheless, in July 2006 almost 4 percent of the Reserve Banks’ daily volume, or about one and a half million checks, was presented to paying banks in electronic Check 21 files, and this volume is growing rapidly. Thus, banks are starting to realize many of the benefits of the end-to-end electronic check processing that were envisioned when Check 21 was enacted, including efficiency gains and cost savings. In addition, they are beginning to offer their customers new and better services. For example, some banks are offering their business customers the ability to truncate checks and deposit them electronically. Also, banks are now able to set a later-in-the-day cutoff hour for check deposits because they can transmit checks electronically from their branches to their central processing facilities for collection. As a result, banks should be able to provide customers with improved funds availability, more efficient cash management services, and better access to services for their geographically remote customers. The evolution of electronic check collection How will electronic check collection evolve in the years to come? The industry is discussing several possible models. In the first, check images are transmitted to the paying bank along with the MICR-line payment information.3 In the second, the MICR information is transmitted to the paying bank while the check images are stored in remote archives that can be accessed on demand. Both models are already being used to some extent and each has its advantages and disadvantages. I suspect that, as the industry gains greater experience with electronic check collection, the superiority of one of the models may become clearer.  Those who favor the first model believe that it allows paying banks to better manage their risks and customer relationships. Paying banks would not have to rely on multiple image archive providers, with whom they may have no direct contractual relationship, to obtain check images for customer online banking services and backroom operations. Others believe that a small number of centralized check-image archives, as envisioned in the second model, would be more cost-effective and would not appreciably increase risk or degrade customer service. In this model, the MICR information on a check could be transmitted over a dedicated network or, as recently suggested by some bankers, the ACH.                                                       2 Check 21 removed legal barriers that were preventing electronic technologies from being applied to long-established check-collection processes. Before Check 21, a bank had to present the original paper check to the paying bank unless the paying bank had agreed to accept presentment of the check electronically. While Check 21 did not mandate the electronic processing or presentment of checks, it did authorize a new negotiable instrument, called a substitute check, which is the legal equivalent of the original check. By permitting banks to use substitute checks in the check-collection process when the recipient could not or would not accept electronic presentment, Check 21 has facilitated the expanded use of electronic technologies in check processing, enabling the banking industry to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of its check-processing operations over the long run. 3  The magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line is the line of numbers printed near the bottom of the check, which generally includes the paying bank’s routing number, the customer’s account number, the check number, and the amount of the check. 2 BIS Review 83/2006 
The ACH is seen as a potentially attractive option because it is an electronic system that reaches all depository institutions and could eliminate the need to print substitute checks.  The flow of check information over the ACH system raises the legal question of whether the payments should be characterized as checks or electronic fund transfers. If the payments were characterized as checks, under current check law banks can choose whether to receive presentments electronically or in paper form. A key principle underlying Check 21 was to maintain this choice by permitting banks to participate in electronic check processing when their business case justified doing so. Requiring banks to accept electronic check presentment simply because they participate in the ACH system and have agreed to abide by NACHA rules might be viewed as contrary to this principle. Alternatively, if the payments were characterized as electronic funds transfers, then how would banks obtain the authorizations required under Regulation E to convert the transactions into ACH payments? When evaluating the relative benefits of using the ACH network for these payments, we must consider these threshold legal questions.  A perspective on the future U.S. check system The checkless society has been predicted for decades; however, as we near 2007, we know that even though checks are used less frequently, they are still used widely. Industry experts are understandably wary of predicting what lies ahead for the U.S. check system. However, as we engage in strategic discussions on the future of checks and contemplate investments in check-processing infrastructure, we need to consider how the check system might evolve. Let me take a first step and offer one perspective. The decline in check use has already caused the Reserve Banks to reduce by half the number of offices at which they process paper checks. In 2003, the Reserve Banks had forty-five check-processing offices nationwide, versus the twenty-two they have today and the eighteen that they will have by early 2008. Further consolidations are likely as check volumes continue to decline and as checks are increasingly processed electronically. Ultimately, perhaps sometime late in the next decade, the Reserve Banks might process checks at only a single office nationwide. These changes in the Federal Reserve’s check-processing infrastructure will benefit bank customers by entitling them to earlier funds availability on their check deposits, because all checks will eventually become local checks, which are generally subject to a maximum permissible hold period of two business days. This will present risk-management challenges for banks because a bank seldom learns that a local check is unpaid before it must make the funds available to the customer for withdrawal. Moreover, while some checks are being collected faster as a result of electronic processing, in the future other checks might be collected more slowly. We have already seen some banks decide to process large- and small-dollar checks differently. Specifically, many banks are expediting the collection of larger-dollar checks by taking advantage of the Check 21 authority. On the other hand, banks are continuing to collect smaller-dollar checks in paper form, using physical transportation networks, because the value of collecting these smaller-dollar checks faster does not justify the cost of doing so. As larger-dollar checks are increasingly cleared electronically, the use of relatively expensive dedicated check-transportation networks to clear the aggregate value of the remaining checks will be harder and harder to justify economically. As a result, it is quite possible that it will take longer to collect smaller-dollar checks as dedicated, high-cost check-transportation networks are scaled back or eliminated and these checks are transported using slower, less costly means. The Federal Reserve is now studying whether overall improvements in the check-collection system would be sufficient in the near term to justify the Board’s use of its authority under the Expedited Funds Availability Act to reduce maximum hold periods.4 The likely slowing of the collection of smaller-value checks could make any change problematic in the near term. Nonetheless, as I have already noted, recent and future consolidations of Federal Reserve check-processing regions have benefited,                                                       4  The Expedited Funds Availability Act requires that the Board reduce the maximum hold periods to the period of time necessary for the depositary bank to reasonably expect to learn of the nonpayment of most checks in a given category. Because roughly half of all checks are for amounts of less than $100, the improvements in the check system due to Check 21 would likely not result in faster collection and return of most local or nonlocal checks in the near term.  BIS Review 83/2006 3 
and will continue to benefit, bank customers as many nonlocal checks become local and therefore subject to shorter maximum holds. If the payments system evolves as I have just outlined, then it is possible that in the next ten to twenty years the Reserve Banks will accept only checks that are deposited electronically and that can be presented electronically; any remaining paper checks may have to be cleared through other channels. In this scenario, the current paper-check infrastructure of the Federal Reserve that is heavily reliant on physical transportation will be replaced by an electronic-processing infrastructure with a production data center and a few backup sites, not unlike today’s ACH network. The role of the Reserve Banks in the provision of retail payments services The changes I have just described could very well have implications for the role of the Federal Reserve in the payments system. From its inception in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not only been closely involved in overseeing the nation’s payments system but has also been an important operational component of that system. This latter role has involved competing with the private sector to provide certain retail payments. Congress originally wanted the Federal Reserve to play this operational role to reduce inefficiencies in the payments arena. This role has changed considerably over the past century, with some changes resulting from the enactment of statutes such as the Monetary Control Act, or the MCA. The MCA went a long way toward establishing a relatively level playing field on which the Reserve Banks and private-sector payments providers have competed over the past quarter century. However, because of the inherent differences between the central bank and private-sector service providers, a truly level playing field will never be entirely possible. The Reserve Banks enjoy certain advantages, such as an unsurpassed credit rating, that makes them an attractive service provider in times of financial stress. On the other hand, the Reserve Banks do not have the flexibility enjoyed by their competitors to negotiate fees and other service terms with individual customers. Because of these differences, it is incumbent on us from time to time to reexamine our operational role in the payments system. These assessments have focused in the past, and should continue to focus in the future, on the Federal Reserve’s role as a provider of retail payment services. Large-value payments systems, such as Fedwire, are typically viewed as core, systemically important services, and they are commonly provided by other central banks around the globe. A rationale for the participation of a government-related entity, such as the Federal Reserve, in the retail payments system is harder to formulate. The most recent assessment of this operational role was conducted in the late 1990s, by the Committee on the Federal Reserve in the Payments Mechanism, better known as the Rivlin Committee, and it focused on the Federal Reserve’s role in the check and ACH systems. Ultimately, the committee concluded that the Federal Reserve should remain a provider of both check-collection and ACH services and should play a more active role in helping the banking industry become more efficient. The committee determined that the Federal Reserve played an important role in providing both check and ACH services to small and remote institutions and that, if the Federal Reserve stopped providing these services, it could disrupt the market in the short run, resulting in higher prices and more regulation, with little promise of substantial benefits over the long run. In recent years, we have actively pursued a strategy of engaging the industry in discussions on payments system issues and offering services designed to encourage the increased use of electronics. As we move into a more steady-state electronic check environment, the Federal Reserve may find it appropriate once again to review its longer-term operational role in the retail payments system. Clearly, at that time, the Federal Reserve’s national reach will no longer be a compelling reason for its operational role. As the Federal Reserve assesses its role in providing retail payment services, it will be important to consider how the circumstances that have provided the rationale for the Federal Reserve’s continuing involvement in retail payments services may have changed. The review would have to address, among other things, the following questions: If the Reserve Banks were to withdraw from check and ACH services, would these services continue to be provided competitively and cost-effectively? Would depository institutions continue to have equitable access to these services? In the event of an unanticipated shock, would the payments system be sufficiently resilient?  4 BIS Review 83/2006 
Conclusion In conclusion, the retail payments system will continue to become increasingly electronic even though the exact nature of that system is not yet clear. What is clear, however, is that the Federal Reserve will continue to foster a safe and efficient payments system. This shift away from paper and toward the electronic processing of payments has significant operational and legal implications that all of us need to ponder. I believe that an ongoing dialogue among payments system participants will help us address, in a balanced and thoughtful manner, these important issues that affect the long-term strategic direction of the U.S. financial system. This symposium is a welcome and constructive part of that dialogue. BIS Review 83/2006 5 
T T Mboweni: Monetary policy and the markets – a two-way street  Address by Mr T T Mboweni, Governor of the South African Reserve Bank, at the Star/Safmarine Breakfast, Johannesburg Country Club, Johannesburg, 7 September 2006. *      *      * Honoured guests Ladies and gentlemen 1. Introduction Central banking has come a long way since the days, not too many years ago, when monetary policy was shrouded in secrecy. Central bank communication was akin to deciphering an obscure biblical tract, and monetary policy very often surprised the markets. It is almost unbelievable that as recently as 1994 the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) did not even announce the monetary policy decision, let alone the justification thereof, and it was left to the market to infer from the Fed’s actions in the market whether or not there had been a change in the monetary policy stance. The monetary economist, Karl Brunner, was most scathing in his criticism and in 1981 argued that the peculiar mystique surrounding central banking thrived on the pervasive impression that central banking was an esoteric art confined to the initiated elite. He further added that “the esoteric nature of the art is moreover revealed by an inherent impossibility to articulate its insights in explicit and intelligible words and sentences”.  As we know, things are very different today. The pendulum has swung in the opposite direction, prompting Alan Blinder, a former Vice-Chairman of the US Federal Reserve System, to refer to it as the ‘quiet revolution’. Much of the debate about communication now focuses on the issue of whether central banks can be too transparent. Notable economists in the field such as Blinder and Lars Svensson argue for maximum transparency, while others, for example Frederic Mishkin, argue that there are limits to transparency. I will argue today that transparency and communication are a function of the decision-making process and particular institutional features, which in effect means that no single approach can be regarded as ‘best practice’.  In looking at issues such as transparency and communication, the point must also be made that communication is a two-way street. Making monetary policy also involves giving attention to signals coming from the market. Indeed, the argument is sometimes made that the central bank should simply follow the market, raising the question of who takes the lead. 2.  Communication from the market to the Bank It is generally agreed that there is much market information of a forward-looking nature that is extremely useful for monetary policy. Sometimes central banks will follow market movements which can provide information about the outlook that is independent of policy and that is crucial to monetary policy decisions. Prices and interest rates incorporate all information available to the market, and therefore provide important signals about the future. True, there are times when the central bank may have information that is not in the public domain, but equally, many private sector institutions are privy to certain information, or may have superior information because of specialised research in a particular area. Hence a two-way flow of information does exist in practice. The Bank therefore takes market information very seriously and we look at a number of forward-looking indicators. These include the forward rate agreements (FRAs), the yield curves and yield spreads, break-even inflation rates, the Reuters consensus forecasts and the implied forward exchange rate curves, to name a few. We are also in the privileged position to receive a wide range of detailed in-house research from domestic and international financial institutions. These give us some indication of market expectations concerning various variables. There is a rich literature on the information content of yield curves. The generally accepted wisdom is that monetary policy determines the very short end of the curve to a significant degree. However monetary policy does not determine the long-term rates. These are determined by a number of variables, including real output growth and the market’s expectation of long-term inflation and BIS Review 82/2006 1 
expectations of the future monetary policy stance. For this reason there is not usually a close relationship between long-term bond rates and the repo rate, although the yield curve may contain useful information about the stance of monetary policy, and the market’s expectations of future inflation and real activity. Interpreting the information contained in the yield curve or the yield spread is not always straightforward. Standard theory tells us that the long-term nominal rate reflects the real rate and inflation expectations. But neither of these components is observable, and there may be other components as well such as liquidity premia which complicate the story. Also, the extent to which the long-term rates react to central bank actions depend on the credibility of monetary policy. The information content of the yield curve or yield spread is therefore not always clear-cut. I am sure you all remember not too long ago Chairman Greenspan’s long-term interest rate ‘conundrum’ in the United States. Similarly, in South Africa, we were recently told that long-term interest rates were being affected by liquidity considerations, as government’s fiscal prudence had resulted in a shortage of scrip in the market. We would therefore not want to set policy on the basis of a single indicator, and we would look to other indicators as well for corroboration. Inflation expectations are critical to monetary policy decisions. Here we would rely on a number of indicators, including the long-term bond yields, the yield differential between conventional and inflation-linked bonds, the Reuters consensus forecasts, and the inflation expectations survey that we have commissioned the Bureau for Economic Research to conduct on our behalf. All of these measures are imperfect, but they are indicative and, unless they contradict each other, they could contain valuable information for policy purposes.  Although there are strong arguments for taking note of market signals, this does not solve all our problems. No matter how well-informed markets are, or central bankers for that matter, they do not have perfect foresight. As we know, the future is inherently unpredictable. Even if we make policy optimally on the basis of all available information, new information becomes available all the time. Behavioural relationships by their very nature are very difficult to predict. For example, we may expect on the basis of our models that if real incomes rise, consumer expenditure will increase in proportion to the estimated parameters. However, certain other unpredictable factors such as natural disasters, or geopolitical influences to name a few, are not easily forecastable. As these events unfold and are absorbed by the markets, current prices adjust, making previous forecasts redundant. This is the nature of asset markets. For this reason forward prices are changing all the time, which makes it difficult to easily use all the market information with total confidence. It also explains why forecasts, including our own, are periodically revised. Take the example of oil prices. As you know, oil prices are an important factor of our inflation rate. The international oil price is an exogenous variable in our inflation forecasting model, but the inflation forecast is critically dependent on our assumptions about the future path of oil prices. We are not oil market experts, but we try to understand the supply and demand factors that impact on the market.  We also look at the forecasts of a number of institutions, many of which would have specialised oil price models and therefore presumably have a superior view of the oil price outlook. However, these forecasts can vary significantly. According to the Reuters consensus survey, at the June meeting of the MPC, the forecasts for Brent crude for 2006 ranged from US$56 to US$67 per barrel, and the range for 2007 was US$46 to US$64. According to the latest Reuters consensus survey, the range for 2006 is now between US$63 and US$72 per barrel, and for 2007 the range is between US$53 and US$75 per barrel. This indicates the enormous degree of uncertainty even among institutions that put a lot of effort into forecasting the oil price. We can take advice from the market, but whose advice do we take in this instance? The average or ‘consensus’ is not necessarily superior to any of these individual forecasts. Some central banks simply look at the oil futures prices, rather than trying to predict the impossible. But as we all know, the futures curve shifts continuously as current prices change. All it tells us is what today’s price is, and what the implied price is over the next few months on the basis of a risk-free interest rate and, storage costs. A sudden incident in Nigeria, Iraq or Iran, or a new tropical storm system, for example, will suddenly change both the spot and futures prices. Similar reasoning can be applied to forward rates in the currency and interest rate markets. These change almost continuously as new information is absorbed by the market. The FRAs for example change every time there is a change in the exchange rate, because of the expectation that this could lead to a change in interest rates. As most studies show, even though forward rates, whether 2 BIS Review 82/2006 
currency, commodity or interest rates, are supposed to be unbiased predictors of future spot rates, they are nevertheless not very good predictors. This is the uncertain environment in which we as the central bank have to conduct monetary policy. Clearly, we cannot change monetary policy on a daily basis. We have to take a forward-looking, longer-term perspective on the basis of ever-changing data and events, news and surprises. While we can rely on the market for some information, in the end we have to make the decisions on the basis of our judgement. The collective view of the market helps us to make as informed a judgement as possible.  3.  Should the Bank follow the market in setting interest rates? So far I have considered the issue of the flow of forward-looking data from the market to the Bank. As I noted earlier, there is a strong case for the Bank to use such information as part of its data for policy decisions. I do not think that this is particularly controversial. A related, but more complicated issue, is the question of whether the Bank should follow the market when it comes to setting interest rates. In other words, should monetary policy simply set interest rates on the basis of market expectations?  Today it is generally accepted that monetary policy should be sufficiently transparent so that the market can discount changes in monetary policy in advance. If the market correctly anticipates monetary policy actions, there will be little reaction to monetary policy announcements. One way of achieving this favourable outcome is to simply follow market expectations. However, if there is effective communication, market expectations of central bank actions will not be independent of Bank actions and signals. Indeed, an important dimension of monetary policy is to influence market expectations. Under such circumstances, interest rate expectations are not formed independently of the view that the market has of central bank actions. In other words, if we signal a change in the monetary policy stance, this will be reflected in current market rates ahead of the actual change in the policy stance. Under such conditions, although it could appear that we are following the market, we are in fact leading it.  Blinder, in his book “The Quiet Revolution’, also warns against central banks becoming too respectful of markets. He argues that slavishly following the market could lead to poor policy for a number of reasons. Firstly, there is the problem of herd behaviour, which may or may not be rational, in speculative financial markets. This results in overreactions to stimuli whereas monetary policy makers need to proceed with caution and prudence. Secondly, speculative bubbles are a fact of life. As Blinder graphically puts it, ‘central bankers must steadfastly resist such whimsy and inoculate themselves against the faddish behaviour that so often dominates markets. That may be why central bankers are not much fun at parties’. Finally, he argues that market traders tend to have much shorter time horizons than central bankers. This is even the case where long-term bonds are traded, but are in fact treated as shorter-term instruments. The result is that by following the market, monetary policy could land up having a short time horizon and be prone to overreaction. It is important for monetary policy to maintain a focus on the medium term. We have to see through the short term noise and not be blinded by it. 4.  Communication from the Bank to the market As I mentioned at the outset, increased transparency is a feature of modern central banking. Although transparency is an essential part of the inflation targeting framework, it is not unique to this framework. It is also the case that communication strategies of central banks differ widely, implying that there is no single blueprint for central bank communication. In many cases, the nature of the communication is determined by the institutional environment. I think it is safe to say that the record of transparency at the South African Reserve Bank has improved significantly with the introduction of inflation targeting. The adoption of inflation targeting in itself was an important step towards increased transparency as it includes the announcement of a clearly defined overriding monetary policy objective - that is, to maintain CPIX inflation within the target range of 6 to 3 per cent. Other elements of improved transparency include the detailed monetary policy statement released after each MPC meeting, the publication of the Monetary Policy Review, the Monetary Policy Forums as well as the numerous speaking engagements undertaken by myself and my colleagues. Of course transparency is a matter of degree, and there are some areas in which you may feel we fall short, but this is an evolving process.  BIS Review 82/2006 3 
Transparency can also be taken too far and there are also some areas of what I would regard as spurious transparency. Take for example our inflation forecast. In the Monetary Policy Review, we publish the graph of our most recent inflation forecast with the assistance of the fan chart tool. In our monetary policy statements we have taken to giving some idea of our inflation forecast at each meeting. We do not however publish the exact numbers pertaining to each point, although we generally indicate the peak and the end point. Some analysts have criticised the Bank for not publishing every point along the trajectory. I would argue that this is a case of spurious transparency. It will not make any difference to the policy decision if the outcome in three years time is 4,8 or 4,9 per cent. What we focus on is the overall general trajectory and its relationship to the target range. In any event, because of the inherently uncertain nature of the forecast, it is depicted in the form a fan chart which illustrates the uncertainties. There is a more substantive and difficult issue related to transparency. In publishing inflation forecasts, the question arises as to how to communicate the path of interest rates on which the forecasts are conditioned. Three different methods are used in practice, each with its own problems. We have adopted an approach common to a number of central banks, of assuming an unchanged monetary policy stance over the forecast period. In doing so, we are not committing ourselves in advance to a particular interest rate path. At a simplistic level, this approach could tell us that if the forecast is above the target, then the stance should be tightened and vice versa. It does not tell us how the forecast will change if interest rates are changed, although different scenarios on different interest rate assumptions can be run. It also does not tell us what the optimal interest rate path would be to keep inflation within the target range over the forecast period. Thus, interest rates may not remain unchanged over the forecast period if inflation is to be kept within the target range. Nevertheless this approach does illustrate clearly the rationale for changing interest rates or leaving them unchanged.  An alternative approach, which has been adopted by a number of central banks, is to look at the market forecasts of future interest rates. It has been pointed out by various analysts that this approach contains a problem of circularity. As noted earlier, market rates are set to some extent on the basis of what the central bank is expected to do, so there is nothing to pin down the system, leading to indeterminacy of inflation.  The third option, favoured by a number of academics, is for the Bank to give its forecast of the future path of interest rates. The central banks of New Zealand and Norway follow this route. The difficulty here is that the public has to understand that these paths are not unconditional commitments, but that they can change if the facts change. Unless this is fully understood, it can have an adverse impact on monetary policy credibility. There are other practical problems with this approach. In particular, how do you get a committee of eight people to agree on a path of interest rates over the next three years, when it is sometimes exceedingly difficult enough reaching agreement on the current move! It should be borne in mind that monetary policy in New Zealand is made by the Governor alone and not by committee, which reduces some of the practical difficulties associated with this approach.  Even if a full path is not specified, there is also the question of whether or not the monetary policy committee should signal future moves or policy bias. Here again practice varies from country to country, as the ability to signal effectively between meetings is often determined by the nature of the decision-making process in a country. Where the responsibility rests with a committee and decision-making is by consensus, as is the case in South Africa, clear signals or commitments between meetings becomes more of a communication challenge. There have been times when we have been criticised for “surprising” the markets. It may well be that in some instances the communication could have been clearer, but it is also the case that the market does not always fully appreciate the conditionality of the signals. Let me give two examples. At the June 2004 MPC meeting, interest rates were left unchanged, but we were concerned about the risks to the inflation outlook. At the press conference following the meeting I warned that the ‘party is over’. This was widely quoted in the press and taken as a signal that we had reached the trough of the interest rate cycle. At the next meeting, we lowered interest rates by 50 basis points, which led to accusations that we had misled the markets. There were a number of significant changes between the two meetings. These included the improvement in inflation expectations and the appreciation of the rand which contributed to a lower inflation forecast. Two lessons come out of this. Firstly, any signal that is given is not an unconditional commitment. These commitments are conditional upon things remaining the same or changing in a particular anticipated direction. Quite clearly, the conditions did not remain the same in this instance. The second related lesson is that markets should not lose sight of the fundamentals. Instead of 4 BIS Review 82/2006 
focusing only on what the Bank says at a particular point in time, we should all keep track of how the fundamentals are evolving. Policy should then be assessed on whether the move was justified on the basis of the new information.  A more recent illustration was provided in April this year when we raised the repo rate by 50 basis points, again taking some in the market by surprise. However, the tone of the statement issued at the end of the previous meeting was intentionally ‘hawkish’, in order to signal a possible rate hike at the next meeting. The markets recognised the hawkish nature of the statement and most of the analysts picked up on this. Yet when the increase came at the following meeting, it took some in the market by surprise. Perhaps we did not communicate clearly enough, but perhaps the market was also not listening intently enough. 5.  Recent economic developments Before ending, I would like to highlight some recent economic developments. In the past few weeks there have been a number of data releases which are of relevance to the Bank. Unfortunately most of these releases have not contained much news, and these developments underline the risks to the inflation outlook that we have been highlighting in the past few MPC meetings. CPIX inflation for July was 4,9 per cent, slightly up from 4,8 per cent the previous month. The main drivers were food and petrol prices. At these levels, we are still well within the inflation target range of 6 to 3 per cent. Of concern however is the broad-based rise in producer price inflation which measured 8,1 per cent in July, the highest year-on-year rate of increase since January 2003. Of particular concern as well is the 18,3 per cent year-on-year increase in prices of agricultural goods. Credit extension numbers show that consumers are still borrowing at a strong pace and there are no clear indications that demand for credit are being affected by the recent changes to interest rates. We are aware however that there is likely to be a lag before these effects are seen. Twelve-month growth in bank loans and advances to the private sector accelerated from 23,3 per cent in June 2006 to 24,6 per cent in July. Mortgage advances were a major contributor to this. Trade account data also indicate the continued underlying strength of domestic demand. South Africa’s trade deficit which had narrowed in June widened to R53,2 billion in July. In July, exports increased month-on-month by 3,3 per cent while imports increased by 6,6 per cent. It is not all bad news however. Growth in real gross domestic product increased at an annualised rate of 4,9 per cent in the second quarter of this year, compared to a revised rate of 4,0 per cent in the first quarter. Although real value added by the agricultural sector declined significantly, real value added by the mining sector grew by 3 per cent, This followed three successive quarters of negative growth in this sector. The manufacturing sector, which experienced annualised growth of 6,1 per cent show signs of sustained resilience. The construction sector remains the strongest growing sector in the economy. 6.  Conclusion Let me conclude by saying that communication between the Bank and the market goes both ways. However, communication can only be effective if we listen to each other. The Bank recognises the importance of effective communication and we will continue to try and improve on this. We should also guard against excessive communication, however, as too much information could also result in excessive noise or confusion. Transparency does not however mean that we will always be telling the markets what our monetary policy decisions will be in advance of our meetings. The essence of transparency is for us to react in a consistent manner in response to changes in the economy which impact on our stated objective. Thank you very much. BIS Review 82/2006 5 
Radovan Jelasic: Overall goals of the National Bank of Serbia Speech by Mr Radovan Jelasic, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, at the Business Luncheon on "Dialogue Critical for Economic Stability and Progress", American Chamber of Commerce, Belgrade, 10 July 2006. *      *      * Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  It is my pleasure to welcome all of you on behalf of the National Bank of Serbia and just before the start of the summer break period. I am sure that we will all have an eventful time period after the summer break, so enjoy every minute of your vacation!  Before I start to answer some of the questions I was asked to focus on during my speech today, I would like to emphasize some issues regarding the overall goals of the National Bank of Serbia during the time to come: 1.  Bring down inflation to single digit level without using exchange rate as the main anchor It is going to be a tough ride but we will succeed, as usual, despite the fact that this room is full of people that would be able to give dozens of reasons why this cannot happen (history, euroization, lack of confidence, etc.). All of these reasons against reestablishing the dinar I have heard, discussed and answered before. Therefore, I would like to emphasize once more that the National Bank of Serbia will bring down the inflation rate and that is not going to be painless! Just like in the region, traditional populism will be loud here as well: “lower economic growth”, “unreal exchange rate will hurt exporters” … But instead of trying to convince me why this cannot happen in Serbia as well, please help us with advice regarding the tools needed in order to make it happen and, parallel to that, hedge yourselves!  2.  Build up an efficient financial system The goal of the National Bank of Serbia is to build up an efficient financial system that, in addition to a stable capital base and first class owners, is also characterized by a) low margins and cheap services, b) high level of public confidence, c) efficient intermediation. We have come a long way during the last five years but it is far from being enough! We can and should do more, much more in improving the efficiency of the financial system, for which we need more transparency of the financial services and more public education of the citizens. The ultimate goal of the financial sector restructuring is not privatisation but to build up an efficient system! I have no problems saying that, despite the fact that in the rest of the economy privatisation itself is proclaimed as the ultimate goal! But I never compare the financial sector to the rest of Serbia, as it should not be our benchmark! 3.  Finish the restructuring of the National Bank of Serbia National Bank of Serbia has reduced the number of employees by almost 75% since October 5th, 2000 and has been halved since I took the position of the Governor. Despite the fact that the average salary increased by almost 30% last year, the total amount (taking into account all employee salaries) remained the same. And I am convinced we can still do more!  And now let me move on to some of the issues I was asked to highlight! Were our monetary policy measures effective during the last two years? Yes, they were because without them the inflation rate would have been substantially higher and loan growth even more explosive! Has the central bank administrative tools to stop completely the monetary expansion and credit growth? Of course it has. But do we want it? The answer is decisively no! I have no problems admitting that I would have preferred to see a lower level of euroization as of today, but it will come and we are already on a good track. As far as accumulation of new foreign commercial debt is concerned it is going to be a challenge in the medium term! But these challenges, I honestly hope, are shared by the financial community as well, because it is their money!  BIS Review 82/2006 1 
There are lots of talks, including speculations, regarding the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. Let me emphasize some issues here:  • I talk to the Minister of Finance just often enough and the coordination is fine; • I do not judge the work of the Government based on public statements because it is simply impossible, but based on concrete numbers; • I do not agree with several steps the Government is taking in the area of enterprise restructuring and fiscal policy, but I do not hide it and, whether I like it or not, the Government is independent and responsible not to the National Bank of Serbia but to the Parliament;  • Journalists are masters in provoking quarrels between Government (Minister of Finance) and Governor, but I do not see that myself or the institution could benefit from it, as the National Bank is not running for seats in the parliament;  • And yes, there is too much burden on monetary policy and the central bank and I would love to get a helping hand;  • Last but not least, I am also aware that if inflation comes down it will happen only “thanks to the tough fiscal stance of the Government” but if it remains high it will be “due to the not restrictive enough monetary policy”. But I do not care about the comments, only results!  However, I do get more than annoyed when instead of appreciation I hear accusations from some Government representatives that did not do their fair part and, in addition to that, even criticize the central bank for being hyperactive! Recently I have been hearing a lot of tenuous criticism of the National Bank of Serbia regarding bank privatisation. Let me set it clear: I/We did not cause the interruption of the SAA talks with the EU, I did not contribute to the substantial increase of both USD and EUR yields on Serbia’s debt, nor did I say that Serbia does not need a new IMF arrangement. These are the crucial reasons that may prompt a bank to come or not to come to Serbia, and not reserve requirements on short-term foreign borrowing up to two years! I definitely communicate differently with the industry compared to my predecessors. I do not like one-on-one meetings and do not give oral promises; neither do I suggest to general managers what they need to do! I have no problems admitting that some events between the commercial banks and the National Bank of Serbia could and should have been avoided. But this is transition and do not underestimate the role of the journalists that love to create headlines! Last but not least, the exchange rate. “More float and less management” has been emphasized and carried out by the National Bank since September last year. The events of the last days of 2005 and the recent week are just a proof of the need to hedge foreign currency positions – the sooner the better. The exchange rate is not even mentioned among the 3 goals the National Bank of Serbia should pursue! It will take some time to enter the EU, and thereafter the eurozone, so we do not have an alternative. The central bank will not allow excessive daily fluctuations either way, but the rate is being increasingly determined by the market! So do not fall into the “good old Serbian” habit: all gains from depreciation are, so to say, normal extra profit and are automatically pocketed, while in the case of appreciation the blame is on the central bank! If you are gambling, you cannot accuse the casino of losing your money! I would like to finish with a positive note that we all experience on a day-to-day basis: while the rest of the economy is only closing down facilities and reducing the number of employees, the financial sector is hiring, opening new branches and growing fast. Moreover, the financial sector is the only one in Serbia in which the private sector is making more that the public one! Although this is something I am often questioned about by all of my colleagues at the central bank and I have a rough time explaining to them that we are normal and that the rest 2mn is abnormal! So much for the introduction. I look forward to answering your questions! 2 BIS Review 82/2006 
Y V Reddy: Use of technology in the financial sector - significance of concerted efforts Address by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Banking Technology Awards Function 2006, at the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology, Hyderabad, 2 September 2006. *      *      * Shri Arvind Sharma, Director, IDRBT, members of the Governing Council of the IDRBT, fellow bankers and distinguished guests,  It gives me immense pleasure to be here with friends from the banking fraternity. In fact, being here is part of my annual pilgrimage to the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT). At the outset, I would like to compliment the Governing Council, faculty and staff of the IDRBT for continuing with their mission with distinction.  The foundation for large-scale induction of IT in the banking sector was provided by the recommendations of the committees headed by Dr. C. Rangarajan, in 1984 and 1989. Subsequently, in 1994, the Reserve Bank constituted a committee on 'Technology Upgradation in the Banking Sector'. The committee made a number of recommendations covering payment systems including setting up of an autonomous centre for development and research in banking technology. The IDRBT was created as a sequel. The Institute has established and operates the INdian FInancial NETwork (INFINET), performs research in banking technology and provides consultancy services apart from providing educational and training facilities for the banking sector.  In my remarks today, I would like to highlight the need for concerted efforts to enhance the use of technology in the financial sector to ensure efficiency, stability, competition and above all service to the common person. Technology and the RBI I would like to enumerate for record a few technology-related initiatives of the RBI. First, the establishment of the mechanised cheque processing systems using the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) technology in India. These have been acknowledged the world over as systems which have stabilised well with overall reject rates of around 1% while, I understand, that the international rates are around 2%. Those who operate these systems, therefore, deserve to be complimented. Second, the technological infrastructure created by the IDRBT since the establishment of the INFINET in 1999. This was aimed at sharing expensive IT resources so as to achieve the economies of scale. One of the notable achievements of the IDRBT has been the implementation of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based electronic data transfer with very high security levels.  Third, the introduction of the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System. It has not only resulted in compliance with the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Basle but has also paved the way for risk-free, credit push-based fund transfers settled on a real time basis and in the central bank money. We had an occasion to compare our RTGS system with other RTGS systems for placing before our Board for Payment and Settlement Systems. It emerged that the Indian RTGS system, which has the 'Y' topology, is considered to be the optimal choice and this topology has also been adopted by several central banks, which have implemented RTGS. Our approach towards intra-day liquidity and potential gridlock resolution follow international patterns. An evaluation of the various components of the RTGS system vis-à-vis the critical evaluation parameters set by the Bank for International Settlements, Basle indicates that we are close to the best on most of the parameters.  The facility for inter-bank funds settlement through RTGS is available today across more than 23,700 branches of banks spanning more than 500 centres in the country. While it is reassuring to note that transactions with large aggregate value are being settled through the RTGS system, with average daily settlement amounting to more than Rs. 60,000 crore, there is still scope for routing many more systemically important payments through the RTGS. For the purpose, enhancing the customer awareness at the user level would be an urgent imperative. It is essential that the RBI, banks and BIS Review 81/2006 1 
large players in the market make concerted efforts in this regard so as to ensure that all large-value customer payments across financial markets, which have systemic implications, flow into the RTGS, such as payments in the equity and debt markets. Once the system achieves a critical mass of usage by the participants, a tipping point would be reached and it should be possible for the financial regulators to consider making the RTGS as the preferred mode for specified large-value transactions in the financial markets.  Fourth, creation of electronic fund transfer systems. It is not necessary that all the fund transactions are settled on a real time basis. It is, therefore, important to expand the reach of other electronic payment mechanisms for small-value customer transactions across the country. Towards this end, the Reserve Bank implemented the Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) System in the mid nineties, which was later upgraded as the Special Electronic Funds Transfer (SEFT) System in 2003 and has now been further enhanced as the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) System since November 2005.  The NEFT system, an improved version of the EFT system, has enhanced security features and facilitates retail funds movement with multiple daily settlements, which enable customers to receive funds within two hours of the settlement. Today, the NEFT facility covers more than 5000 branches of 32 banks spread across 200 centres. The Reserve Bank has taken up as its mission, the expansion of the reach of NEFT to cover all computerised / networked branches of banks as outlined in the Payment Systems Vision document. The plan is to provide NEFT facilities initially at all the RTGS customer-enabled branches and thereafter, extend the same to cover almost all the computerised branches of banks across the country.  Finally, a major initiative, as far as funds movement is concerned, is cheque truncation. In order to improve efficiency and substantially reduce the time taken for cheque processing, the Reserve Bank has initiated steps to introduce a Cheque Truncation System (CTS). A pilot project is scheduled to commence in the National Capital Region in Delhi by the end of this year.  Over the years, the role of the Reserve Bank is changing in tune with the increased levels of maturity of the markets and the financial system as a whole. The role of the Reserve Bank in future would be of a catalyst of change as detailed in the Financial Sector Technology Vision Document published in 2005. In realising this vision, the need for shared efforts towards setting up of world class IT systems will gain greater significance. As a first step, the Reserve Bank has, through the IDRBT, facilitated the setting up the National Financial Switch, which provides such an opportunity to the financial sector. I would urge the banks to make extensive use of this facility. IDRBT is also revamping the entire INFINET structure in consultation with the users to make it more efficient in tune with the international practices. Perhaps, a formal benchmarking of the functioning of our system with the global standards and practices may have to be done and the outcome placed in the public domain.  Technology challenges for the banking sector The entire approach towards technology-based banking has shown significant improvement since the initiation of reforms in the 1990s. The number of public sector banks which has migrated (or are in the process of migration) to Core Banking Systems (CBS), is an indication of the progress in this regard. The unique feature of the CBS is that the concept of branch-based banking gives way to the bank-based banking treating the constituent as the customer not of a particular branch but of the bank as a whole. Today, 21 public sector banks have embarked on the use of such systems and the number of CBS-enabled branches exceeds 14,000 as against 14 banks with about 5000 CBS-branches a year ago. Some of the banks are reportedly facing teething troubles in this area but I trust every effort would be made to stabilise the system to the satisfaction of all customers. I would urge that an assessment of the efficiency of functioning of CBS in all the banks be attempted to facilitate necessary improvements.  The commercial banks have to address various emerging challenges including those arising from large-scale IT deployment. These include the impact of CBS, more scientific risk management, better asset-liability management, ensuring effective anti money laundering measures, and the security concerns relating to implementation of IT in banks. One issue, which often gets raised in any discussion on technology implementation, is the cost it entails. Products such as smart cards, which may not require significant initial capital costs and which can be easily implemented for a large customer base, hold the promise for the future. 2 BIS Review 81/2006 
Let me highlight some of the critical factors, which need to be adequately addressed while dealing with IT. Prime amongst them is the need to ensure appropriate security and integrity of the system. Security in IT systems is only as effective as the weakest link and as financial intermediaries, the banks have to ensure that security features incorporated in IT systems are the best of the breed. With ever-evolving information technology, the security concerns do not remain static and a system of an ongoing critical review of the efficacy of security features and measures needs to be instituted. Integrity of the data processed and stored in IT systems has to be ensured by the banks at all times and adequate back up, including real time replication, to the extent possible, provided for.  Another major requirement relates to disaster recovery management and the fail-safe business continuity plans. In today's world, customer expectations are high and ensuring uninterrupted availability of the IT resources, even in the event of a rather extreme contingency, assumes significance. The banking community, therefore, needs to put in place appropriate contingency plans and test their adequacy at regular intervals.  While the Reserve Bank is providing a common system-wide communications infrastructure, the ultimate objective should be for each bank to develop its own communications network so that the movement of funds within the banks is entirely managed through their own networks. This will avoid excessive dependence on INFINET and improve the overall systemic efficiency. Though a few banks have already done so, there is scope for further progress in this regard by others. There are several co-operative banks too in the system which extend banking services and some of them also have relatively large-scale operations. Perhaps, it is essential that the use of technology in the co-operative banking sector too is enhanced, as appropriate, to bring them closer to the level of the commercial banks.  Technology and financial inclusion We have been highlighting the need for financial inclusion which involves the provision of banking services to the vast multitude of population so far excluded from such services. As far as increasing the scope and coverage of financial inclusion is concerned, some of the challenges which need to be effectively addressed include lack of adequate infrastructure in rural areas, relatively low volumes of transactions, comparatively higher transaction costs, and other factors such as the literacy levels of target customers. Technology offers an excellent tool to effectively address the above challenges. Lack of infrastructure is being addressed in a variety of innovative ways, leveraging technology. Some of these include use of computer systems which do not require uninterrupted electric power supply, networking using radio frequency and other non-conventional methods, centralisation of processing systems leading to lower processing costs, provision of home-grown customised systems such as the low cost, multi-lingual ATM developed by the IIT, Chennai - all of which provide an impetus towards greater financial inclusion.  In South Africa, technology has been deployed to widen the financial inclusion with the introduction of MZANSI account, which is a card-based, limited-service, affordable savings account integrated with the merchant point-of-sale outlets, ATMs and even Post Office outlets. In Philippines, the card-based retail money movement system has won great acclaim. In India, the Reserve Bank, along with the IDRBT, is working on the use of multi-application smart-card systems which can serve as a bank account and also function as a store of electronic cash, as a data repository for essential information relating to the card holder, with built-in security features such as biometric identification, and which can also double up as an entitlement identifier or as a social security card.  It is gratifying to note from a NABARD report that a pilot project on smart cards has already been launched with Sri Visakha Grameena Bank in Andhra Pradesh, which has been one of the front-runner banks in financing Self Help Groups (SHGs). It is expected that with enhanced use of rural-oriented technology, the bank would be able to provide value addition to services offered to the rural clients and further expand its outreach in a sustainable manner. Banks could consider the feasibility of using smart cards for the 'No Frills Accounts' so as to help expand the coverage of the banking services and facilitate the garnering of the much-needed low-cost deposits. Here again, the approach of sharing of IT resources would have much to commend itself.  BIS Review 81/2006 3 
Technology and the government sector It would be appropriate to also outline certain aspects of application of technology to the Government business since RBI is the banker to the Central and State Governments. If we scan the technology initiatives of the States, we find a large divergence in technology absorption across the States. While States like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are generally ahead of others in e-Governance, this is just beginning to happen in the States like Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the North East. As far as Central Government receipts are concerned, the Government's tax collection processes underwent a metamorphosis with the introduction of Online Tax Accounting System (OLTAS) for direct taxes. Enthused by the success of OLTAS, the Central Board of Excise and Customs, in consultation with the Reserve Bank, has introduced the EASIEST (Electronic Accounting System in Excise and Service Tax) project which envisages a comprehensive e-payment module that can be utilised by the banks' corporate customers. The pilot project for this is in an advanced stage of completion. Acceptance by the Government of electronic challans, based on formats to be available on their web sites, would make the process tax-payer friendly. It would also substantially reduce paper usage, provide for Straight Through Processing and obviate errors arising from the reconciliation process, wrong data entry, etc. Another significant initiative taken in this sector by the Reserve Bank was the computerisation of State treasuries throughout the country. After detailed examination of the various aspects, steps are now underway for the establishment of electronic linkage amongst the State Treasuries numbering 3022, agency banks, Finance Departments of the State Governments, Office of the Accountant General and the Reserve Bank of India. This will help in speedier accounting of receipts and payments of the State Government departments, apart from serving as a road map for achieving end-to-end connectivity amongst various accounting agencies involved. It needs to be noted in this context that while use of the state-of-the-art technology within the banking system is an asset, it also poses a challenge to the conventional banker and government accountants due to increase in the speed and complexity of transaction processing. The banks have to ensure that all transactions conducted as agents of Government are secure from end-to-end and are retrievable at any point of time. A successful example of this is the electronic import-licensing system of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade which has an electronic payment facility integrated with the IT systems of the banks. I would like to take this opportunity to mention that at a recent conference of the State Finance Secretaries, the Finance Secretaries of several State governments expressed the view that the technological base and efficiency of services rendered by some of the banks handling Government business needed to be improved significantly. Relationship banking encompassing both, lending with a social focus and operating as a banker to the Government, is valuable but if the quality of service in handling Governments' transactions is not of high standards, some of the banks may not be able to retain their Government business at the current levels. Concerted efforts are, therefore, required by the States and their respective bankers in this regard. Technology and markets Technology has played a significant role in improving the efficiency of the financial markets. The Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) has been functioning well. The introduction of Order Matching NDS (NDS-OM), has helped further in securing better price discovery, transparency in trading, reporting and electronic bidding at auctions. The NDS, implemented since February 2002, provides a platform for screen-based trading in government securities to the member banks and primary dealers with a facility to strike on-line deals anonymously and, thus, experience more efficient price discovery. The process involves the reporting of deals to the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) Ltd. which generates the settlement - gross for the securities and net for the funds leg. At the end of the day, the settlement information is transmitted to the RBI for effecting the same in its books. The CCIL also acts as the central counterparty for the trades by guaranteeing the delivery of securities as well as funds. We are in the process of fully integrating the NDS settlements with the RTGS. In order to improve the functioning of the corporate bond market, a High Level Expert Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitisation (Chairman: Dr. R.H. Patil) has suggested various measures to revitalise the corporate bond market through setting up of trade reporting systems, trading platforms, auction platforms and clearing & settlement systems. The trade reporting systems suggested for corporate bonds is on the lines of Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) of National Association of Security Dealers 4 BIS Review 81/2006 
(NASD) in the US. Such on-line real-time data dissemination will help the participants in making efficient trading decisions and at the same time, enable the regulators to obtain and monitor information on the market trends. These recommendations are under examination by the agencies concerned.   Concluding remarks The basic objective of deployment of technology in the financial sector should be to progressively move away from paper-based transactions, which include use of currency notes, cheques or challans, and to the extent possible, switch over to electronic means using RTGS or NEFT or any other electronic mode.  It is opportune that we are today recognising the valuable contributions of the path breakers in the field of banking technology. The identification of technology leaders and their recognition in the form of Technology Awards is a pointer that we are capable of excelling in our respective fields. The awards of today are not a destination but only mark a good beginning - of a more exciting and challenging era ahead of us in our march towards a technologically advanced and efficient, effective, progressive and inclusive financial system. I wish you all success in your future endeavours. Thank you. BIS Review 81/2006 5 
Panayotis Thomopoulos: The Greek economy and its outlook Speech by Mr Panayotis Thomopoulos, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Greece, at the Covered Bonds Conference, organised by Barclays International, Athens, 1 September 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to address this meeting devoted to an issue of growing importance to the financial community. Experts will speak on the subject of this conference as for me I shall try to introduce the subject of Greece.  It is two years since the successful conclusion of the Athens Olympics and I am glad to observe that the Greek economic performance since then has vindicated those of us who have remained optimists all through the last decade. While two years ago many feared that the Greek economy would slide into a protracted period of slow growth or even recession when the spending for the Olympics ended, and cited Spain as a precedent, we now see that the Greek economy remains one of the strongest in the EU. This performance, achieved in the context of a very significant domestic fiscal adjustment and the Eurozone’ s slow growth until recently, indicates that Greece has a dynamism that reflects important changes on the supply side. In the rest of my speech I will highlight the main strengths of the Greek economy, the risks facing us and the necessary policy measures needed to avoid those risks and maximize the benefits from our strengths.  As I alluded to before, many feared that the demand-led expansion in the run-up to the Olympics would be followed by a significant slowdown and some even predicted that Greece risked falling back into a vicious circle of stagflation. Indeed, between 1980 and 1994, economic performance was abysmal: GDP grew only at 0.7% annually and inflation averaged 16% combined with a rising fiscal deficit, culminating at 13% of GDP in 1993.  Considering the significant initial disequilibria it is not surprising that in the 1990s few believed that Greece would satisfy the strict criteria for Euro area membership, and even after joining the Euro area in 2001 many doubted that it would be able to sustain for long the high rate of GDP growth of 4% p.a. experienced in the 9 years to 2004, compared with only 1.9% for the Euro area as a whole. Indeed, the fears increased as the deterioration of the fiscal situation, associated with the Olympic Games’ overruns partly due to sizeable additional expenditure for security as well as the budgetary relaxation called for a substantial fiscal adjustment, with inevitable dampening effects on growth. Similarly, it was pointed out that the turn-around from a rising trend in net EU transfers in relation to GDP to a falling trend would also impact negatively on growth. Indeed, net transfers fell, from 4.7% of GDP in 1995-1997, to 2.1% of GDP in 2005, but growth continued unabated. In addition, since 2004 Greece, which is heavily dependent on oil imports, suffered from the rapid rise in energy prices as well as from the appreciation of the Euro, which affected especially Greece’s main manufactured export products –textiles, garments, shoes – which after the lifting of the quotas had to confront strong competition from the emerging markets in Asia and the countries in transition in South-East Europe.  The fact that Greece avoided the problems faced by other countries, such as Portugal, after a period of excessive demand growth is a sign of underlying improvements on the supply side. However, equally important is the restoration of the historical links between Greece and the countries in South-East Europe, around the Black Sea as well as with Egypt. For more than 2000 years large Greek communities, in some cases numbering hundreds of thousands, had settled and prospered in these countries. The communist regimes, revolutions and nationalism caused the amicable relations with our wider neighbours to be suspended, and many of these communities disappeared towards the end of the 1940s and in the 1950s: for example, in the 1950s more than 250000 Greeks had to leave Egypt. After 1990, the historical forces of gravity have been re-established; nationalism, as is the case in all EU countries, is now taught only in history books. As a result, friendly relations with our neighbouring countries have been restored. Greece has been a key supporter of Bulgaria’s and Romania’s EU membership, and eventually Turkey’s, as well as of the other South-Eastern European countries. A little story of the weight of history is the immigration to Greece in the last ten years of thousands of Greeks, whose ancestors had settled in Russia between the 1st and 3rd century B.C. and who, in spite of the fact that they were cut off from Greece for almost 800 years, spoke some Greek and preserved many Greek traditions.  BIS Review 81/2006 1 
Until almost the end of the 1990s, Greece had a big handicap: it was located at the periphery of Europe without direct land connections to the main EU members and was surrounded by countries whose economic development had stalled for about 50 years. Nowadays, its geographical location has become an advantage, almost all of its neighbours are growing fast, much faster than the EU as a whole, and very soon two of them will become EU members.  Greece is offering these countries entrepreneurship, expertise and capital as well as a market for their products and surplus labour. Indeed, the Greek private sector has responded quickly and positively to the opening of the region. Greek firms and individuals who spoke the language and knew the culture are establishing themselves in large numbers. Some 5000 Greek firms have set up businesses in these countries in diverse activities, ranging from small bakeries, restaurants, hotel chains, to super-markets, food processing plants, mines, cement factories, metallurgical and aluminium factories, I.T. companies, including telecommunications, trading, shipping and other service companies. Likewise, attracted by the low labour costs and tax rates, many Greek firms relocated their plants, mainly textile, garment, shoe making plants as well as other light industries, from Northern Greece to Bulgaria, FYROM, Albania, i.e. they moved some 30 to 80 kilometres over the other side of the border. This opening and the establishment of a network of Greek firms in all our neighbouring countries, which are moreover growing rapidly, has given a new impetus to the Greek economy - the size of the market is no longer the 11 million Greeks but about 60 to 80 million consumers and many more if we include parts of Turkey which are close to Greece.  The economic interdependence between Greece and its neighbours is now reflected in the sizeable Greek direct investment to South-Eastern European countries. Greeks are among the first two or three foreign investors in these countries. The enlarged market gave the opportunity to Greek firms to increase their size and to establish different processing plants in different countries, according to their cost advantage, with the result that their international competitiveness has been greatly enhanced. This development has been particularly noticeable in the banking sector, as I shall refer below.  Contrary to the direction that capital was taking, labour migrated to Greece: the number of immigrants who have settled in the last 13 years is estimated at about 1 million (mainly from the wider neighbourhood) raising the population to 11 million and causing the labour force to increase by up to 20%. For developed countries, this probably represents the largest foreign worker inflow in such a short space of time. In total, the whole region of South-East Europe is becoming a unified economic space as it used to be for centuries, first in antiquity, then under the Byzantine and, later, the Ottoman Empire.  It is true that Greece is located in, and oriented towards a region of relatively high growth, including the rapidly growing Middle-Eastern countries, whose governments and their nationals have a long tradition of friendship with Greece. The outlook for all these countries remains favourable and indeed, since the start of this decade import demand from our trading partners has systematically exceeded the growth of world trade. While this is significant, it is more significant to note that in 2005 Greece increased its market share in its export markets for the first time after more than a decade of retrenchment, associated with the decline of textile production, and we are on track to repeat this good export performance this year, as exports of goods increased by 13½ percent in the first half of this year, excluding idiosyncratic items such as refined petroleum and ships. A number of indicators suggest that this development is not a statistical artefact but may indicate a more permanent improvement in economic performance. The good export performance is not restricted to a few countries of destination or sectors, but is quite widespread. The opening of the economic space of South-East Europe coincided with a sustained effort to improve domestic economic performance and this has been underpinned by three factors.  • First fixed investment has grown robustly: 7.3% annually since 1995, and 10% for private non-residential investment; this compares with 3.3% for the Euro area as a whole. Moreover, the investment boom affected all sectors: in the second half of the 1990s industry benefited mostly, with fixed investment rising at over 15% annually, whereas in the first half of this decade investment in the service sector, including tourism as well as the construction sector, recorded very high rates of growth.  • Second, extensive privatisations and liberalisations unleashed entrepreneurial spirits and led to the creation of competent new managerial class, which is progressively taking up the reins of the business sector, which, until recently, was almost exclusively run by family members of the owners. This development owes much to the growing interest of foreign companies to buy or take a strategic position in Greek companies following Greece’s decision to join the 2 BIS Review 81/2006 
Euro area. Foreign firms recruit Greek senior staff to run their businesses. Out of the 200 biggest Greek companies a very large proportion is fully or partly owned by foreign companies who prefer to buy existing Greek firms, so as to avoid the heavy and lengthy bureaucratic procedures in setting new companies in Greece. The new managerial class has promoted the restructuring of firms and focused on efficiency, with the result that labour productivity grew by 3% annually in the ten years to 2005 compared with 0.8% for the Euro area and 2.2% for the US, the country which mostly benefited from the I.T. boom.  • Third, although the Government sector is still a drag on the economy, the progress towards fiscal consolidation and the tentative efforts to reduce state intervention and to simplify bureaucracy have started bearing some fruits.  The fact that industrial production has started growing again after a protracted period of retrenchment is another signal in the same direction and indicative of a newfound dynamism. Greece has traditionally been a service economy, with a relatively small manufacturing sector. Although Greek manufacturing firms, with the exception of the declining sectors such as textiles, show healthy profitability – with profit rates above most other European counterparts– and we see new firms being set up in dynamic sectors, the contribution of manufacturing to GDP will continue to be much smaller than in the rest of the EU. The service sector is the engine of growth in Greece and here we see an encouraging performance not only with respect to our main export product, that is tourism, but also with many other export-oriented services in higher value-added sectors which are showing buoyancy. Again, over the last two years the number of tourists arriving in Greece has grown faster than world tourism, indicating that the positive image generated by the Olympics is now producing tangible results. Shipping, a sector of traditionally strong Greek presence has been doing well recently and contributing significantly to Greece’s export earnings (about $15 billion). In effect, over 15% of world shipping and more than 20% of world tankers are owned and run by Greeks all over the world. More importantly, Greek ship-owners are using the current propitious circumstances to renew their fleet, thus ensuring a significant future presence in a sector, where Greeks have thrived for over 3000 years.  The success of the Olympic Games is one reason behind the favourable turn of events. It has helped not only tourism, where benefits were expected all along, but even more merchandise exports, as well as other service sectors as it has reinforced the image of Greece as a stable and reliable partner. That was a positive side-effect that was not much foreseen, as the focus was on promoting tourism. Nowadays, many foreign firms use Greece as a gateway to South-Eastern European countries or in partnership with Greek firms penetrate these markets. Thessaloniki, the second biggest Greek port is expected to play a pivotal role in the economic integration of the Southern-Eastern European countries. The border of Bulgaria, and of landlocked Fyrom are about 80 kms from Thessaloniki and for their respective capitals, Sofia and Skopje, Thessaloniki is the natural outlet to the Mediterranean Sea. Likewise, the southern provinces of Serbia and parts of Romania can equally be served efficiently by the port of Thessaloniki, which, in addition has an interesting cultural life and a pleasant life style. The advantageous location of Thessaloniki will become even more evident after the completion of the planned and partly financed by the EU of the North-South EU road and railway axes.  The renewed optimism about the Greek economy is now reflected in many areas. I wish to refer to the example of construction and housing. There was a widespread belief that construction would be the main victim of a slowdown in the post-Olympics period. There was talk of a housing bubble and of a supply glut. Indeed there was a construction slowdown in the immediate aftermath of the Olympics and a levelling off of housing prices, but since last year we are seeing a renewed dynamism in this sector, unexpected in its degree. In addition to Greeks, many more foreigners than in the past are building secondary residences in the Greek islands and in the mainland.  Total credit growth at around 20% annually and 30% for credit to households since 2001 has been one factor underpinning strong private demand in recent years and has been fuelled by the low Euro area interest rates. I fully accept that we should monitor developments in this area but we are far from becoming alarmed. Greece is a country with a still relatively low household debt-to-GDP ratio – 38% compared with 56% for the Euro area. The rapid credit expansion in this area reflects fundamental changes in the Greek economy and has underpinned the transformation of a fragmented stagnant inward-looking banking sector into a dynamic modern banking sector with strong international competitive presence. The lifting of foreign exchange controls in the mid-1990s and of household credit restrictions in 2001 as well as privatisations and the mergers between a large number of smaller banks since 1997 has created Greek champions (up to the second half of the 1990s almost 2/3 of Greek banks were controlled by the State and were moreover, badly run, compared with about 15% presently, which are managed by professionals).  BIS Review 81/2006 3 
The biggest 5 banks with a 78% market share have been very active is modernising their business not only in Greece but also in acquiring or setting up new banks in all the South-Eastern European countries, where the market share of Greek banks is more than 20% on average, with a high of over 33% in FYROM and a low of somewhat less than 20% in Romania. In this region Greek banks employ around 16.000 employees in their subsidiaries or branches, and few thousand more in EU countries, US, Australia, Canada etc. The recent acquisition of Finansbank, the fifth largest private bank in Turkey by the NBG and of a smaller Turkish bank by Eurobank, as well the purchase of an Egyptian bank by the Bank of Piraeus, is transforming the scenery of the Greek banking sector, which is becoming more international.  The size of Greek banks is increasing so that the disadvantage of their small size is gradually being removed and banks are now in a position to extend their activities into more profitable lines of banking, e.g. private banking, consultancy for M&A, investment banking, asset management etc. Greek banks can now start enjoying economies of scale and scope. These factors are all reflected in their high profitability: This year the return on equity is expected to exceed 20%. At the same time, Greek banks are reinforcing their role as a vehicle facilitating trade in goods and services, investment and capital flows as well as migration between the countries in the wider region. This has led to intensive competition between the Greek banks both in the home market and abroad, with the result that the high Greek interest rate spreads over most Euro area countries’ bank loans has considerably diminished to the benefit of the consumer.  Indeed, competition and financial liberalization allows households to better manage their portfolios of assets and liabilities and in a fast growing economy most households would find it preferable to bring forward the benefits of their expected higher incomes in the future. There is also a stock adjustment issue; starting from a very low level of indebtedness and realizing that Greece has entered a period where interest rates are much lower and risks have diminished, as well as because of their rising wealth, households find it acceptable to carry a larger stock of debt. The flow of borrowing as households adjust to their higher level of desired debt may be very high for a protracted period.  Undoubtedly, as regulators of the banking system we are concerned and we know that many things have to be improved. There is a need for better consumer protection and better education of borrowers about the risks of bad financial choices. We should not forget that the experience of Greeks over the last 15-20 years has been one of falling interest rates first as they converged to the Euro area’s average and then as the ECB relaxed its monetary policy. Now that the ECB is undergoing a phase of monetary policy tightening, the experience of rising interest rates may come as a shock to many households in Greece. In spite of this, between 2002 and 2005, we saw a reduction in the ratio of non-performing loans, a reduction that was particularly steep in the case of mortgage loans where the ratio dropped from 6.9 percent to 3.6 percent over the period.  As far as the Bank of Greece is concerned, our supervisory role obliges us to ask banks to increase provisions, to tighten credit standards and in general to introduce efficient credit control mechanisms, including state-of-the-art risk management units so that even if non-performing-loans increase their CAR will still remain well above 10%: today it is almost 14%. At the same time in collaboration with the host supervisors in the South Eastern European countries, the Bank of Greece monitors closely developments at home and abroad.  An area that we should look into is whether immigrants to Greece can become a valuable bridge and help trade between Greece and their home countries. There is some anecdotal evidence that this is already happening. I should like to note that Greece has always been a country of immigration and has successfully absorbed all the successive waves of immigration throughout the centuries. Greek society has always been open to foreigners: in antiquity, the orator Isocrates (in 380 BC) defined as Hellenes all those who shared our culture, and by definition spoke Greek, and not those who shared a common blood, i.e. of Greek ancestors. Even in the Oath of Alexander the Great (324 BC), it is stated that: ”Unlike the narrow minded, I make no distinction between Greeks and Barbarians. The origin of citizens, or the race into which they were born, is of no concern to me. I have only one criterion by which to distinguish them. Virtue. For me, any good foreigner is a Greek and any bad Greek is worse than a Barbarian”. The word Barbarian had a different meaning that to-day and was then referred to people speaking a language that Greeks could not understand, as it sounded “bar-bar”.  I believe that Greece is now seeing also the fruits of the significant infrastructure investments that took place over the last decade, partly financed by the EU, and of the more tentative structural reforms enacted over this period. There is also a deepening understanding among the population at large, and the business community in particular, that Greece should embrace globalization at last if it is to further 4 BIS Review 81/2006 
improve the living standards. Indeed, it is striking to note that globalization until recently passed Greece by. We were a much more closed economy than most other economies of similar size and level of development. Apart from our location at the periphery of Western Europe, this was the result of an undue reliance on the state to provide the stimulus to growth and job creation and the corresponding over-regulation of the economy, as well as the lack of intra-industry trade as our production was basically oriented to cater for home needs. I believe this was an aberration in Greek history. Greeks embraced globalization long before it became a fad. Notice our strong shipping and merchant traditions, the prospering Greek communities established all over the world, the Greek scientists and researchers that thrive in foreign universities and research centres.  Continuing the adjustment to the new international economic order is a one-way road for Greece. We must start by admitting that Greece cannot compete in labour-intensive, low-wage sectors. Rather than trying to sustain such industries, we should look to what activities we should develop for the future. We should also realize that the public sector, already burdened by debt and facing the pressures of an ageing society cannot continue acting as the engine of employment creation. But let’s note the positive facts: Greece possesses an enormous stock of highly qualified scientists and researchers, both here and abroad. Greek students studying in foreign universities represent a very high percentage of these universities’ foreign student body but unfortunately many remain abroad enticed by higher earnings and the better research facilities than Greece. But in recent years reflecting the rapidly growing living standards and the significant improvements in urban amenities there is a growing number of Greeks returning to Greece. Greece has also moved further than most countries to becoming a service economy. We are thus at a good starting point to thrive in a knowledge-based world economy. Membership of the eurozone provides a stable macroeconomic framework with low interest rates and inflation as well as legal certainty that should allow private business to plan for their long-term growth.  A change that is now bearing fruits was the gradual emergence of Greece as a source, instead of as destination, of foreign direct investment, particularly toward neighbouring countries. While at the time there were fears of an exodus of jobs, we now see that those investments abroad conferred multiple advantages to Greek firms. First of all, they entered new markets, learning a lot about what is demanded there. While much of the demand is filled locally, high-value added exports from Greece play a significant role. Also, the move of the labour-intensive parts of the production process abroad allows the parent firm to survive and prosper, safeguarding the high-end, mainly managerial and research, jobs located in Greece. It is noteworthy that most of the outward investment, which on average has amounted to about half the inward flows, is concentrated in sectors where Greece has enjoyed a comparative advantage, such as food and beverages, finance, trading companies construction, cement, even textiles. They form thus part of Greek firms’ strategies to maintain and enhance their competitive position. Contrary to popular beliefs, outward Greek investment flows are not directed exclusively to low-cost countries. The UK and the US figure prominently among the recipients of Greek FDI, where the four largest foreign subsidiaries of Greek firms in 2005 were located. This indicates that such flows are used mainly to enter foreign markets or acquire necessary know-how and technological expertise.  I find it extremely encouraging that this year we are seeing significant gross flows of foreign direct investment, even if the final net amount may turn out to be small. Indeed, outward FDI flows have been about half the level of inward flows in recent years; as a result, Greece now has a stock of investments abroad exceeding 16 billion dollars, and this may well underestimate the true amount if we take into account the complex statistical problems that surround the collection of this data and the fact that many Greek firms retain (without declaring) in the South-Eastern European countries their exports earnings in order to finance their investment there instead of borrowing at a higher interest rate from the local bank. It is becoming clear that Greece should now actively support efforts to enhance the stability of the international financial system and provide guarantees to cross-border investments.  The inward investment flows not only show that Greece is becoming an advantageous place in which to invest, they also bring with them important benefits, such as know-how. Outward flows should be seen as our entry ticket to foreign markets and as a way for Greek firms to regain their cost advantage.  While much in Greece bodes well for future development, we must not shy away from confronting and solving existing problems. There is a need for government activism, if only to redress the mistakes of the past. In addition, the new environment brings with it new challenges and the need for action. Bureaucracy, despite some progress in the last 10 years, is still stifling entrepreneurial initiative; BIS Review 81/2006 5 
simplified procedures, personnel which are better acquainted with international practises, especially at higher echelons, and less duplication of work are necessary both in order to boost private activities but also in order to reduce the operational cost of the state.  Much has been said about the fiscal imbalances and I would be the last to downplay the need for fiscal consolidation. The accumulated public debt is a burden we should get rid off as soon as possible. Not only does it consume a large part of tax revenues, it is also a source of uncertainty. Small changes in interest rates impose a heavy toll on public finances, as is the case with changes in investors’ sentiment and risk preferences. A similar argument can be made about addressing the lingering problem of our social security systems. Both the explicit public debt and the contingent pension obligations form a source of uncertainty for the private sector, which may reasonably fear revenue-enhancing tax measures in the future. Putting the public finances in order, as planned by the government, by achieving at least a balanced budget should reassure investors and help promote investment in the country.  While the aim should be the elimination of the fiscal deficit, this macroeconomic objective should be reconciled with the microeconomic objective of reducing the tax burden on the economy, and, especially, continuing to alleviate the taxes on entrepreneurship. This aim has become even more pressing as we are facing increased tax competition, especially from neighboring countries and new members of the EU. You may have noticed regular advertisements trumpeting some country’s low tax rates. Combating tax evasion can provide significant revenues, even in the short-run, while at the same time improving efficiency by leveling the playing field. The long-run solution is to have a more efficient and focused public sector that will absorb fewer resources to deliver its necessary services.  I now turn to two particular areas of concern, perhaps interrelated ones, the high level of unemployment, and inflation persistence.  A black spot in the otherwise bright picture of the Greek economy is the stubborn persistence of unemployment. After almost ten years of continuous robust growth, unemployment remains unacceptably high. Unprecedentedly low and falling interest rates, both real and nominal, have played a role by encouraging capital deepening and substitution away from labor. There was also significant labor hoarding at the start of the period for various reasons. Likewise, agricultural employment still represents 8% of the labour force, 4 times as high as the EU average and, to the extent that it diminishes, the outflow of rural labour will continue to inflate total unemployment. Still, no one can deny that there has been insufficient employment creation and so it is worth taking some time to analyze the reasons for that.  First, let’s dispose of some erroneous arguments. Trade and globalization cannot be blamed for this situation. Greece was an unusually closed economy and still has one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe. Indeed, unemployment has fallen, albeit slowly, in the last couple of years just as Greece started opening up to international competition. By the same token we should not look to immigrants as the scapegoats. They are performing jobs that the locals would not undertake. In some cases, by providing low-cost input they help keep production in Greece, thus helping better-remunerated Greek workers. This is much more evident in the case of agriculture where production of several crops would have become uneconomic save for the abundant labor supplied by immigrants.  Instead of looking to put the blame on outsiders for our unemployment problem, it is better to admit that domestic policies are the main reasons for this unacceptable situation. First, there is obviously a mismatch between demand for specialized labour and supply, which calls for a better professional orientation of the tertiary educational level. Likewise the regulatory regime, supposedly created to safeguard jobs, is now discouraging job creation and leads firms to try and minimize the labor input. We should adapt to an economic system that is changing fast and where overly-rigid labour relations together with laws encouraging oligopolistic practices in the business sector, have a detrimental effect on employment itself. There is also a need to reduce the wedge between wage costs to firms and the wages received by employees. This wedge is one of the highest in Europe and is due to the very high social security contributions. It is necessary to reduce this difference in a non-distortionary way.  Another issue for concern is the lack of competition and the rigidities that pervade many product markets in Greece. As I travel quite often abroad I am very often struck by how much dearer some goods and, especially, services are in Greece than in other European countries with higher wage levels. Opening up to foreign entrants and international trade as well as lifting entry barriers to various professional jobs should help induce greater competition and reduce the power of local oligopolies. A strengthened Competition Authority is also a useful tool, and its increased activity is certainly welcome.  6 BIS Review 81/2006 
To sum up Greece, as the other EU countries, is facing its domestic problems but also the challenges arising from the unprecedented rapid globalization. Developments so far shows that Greece is responding successfully by recording the second highest growth rate, over 4% on average since 1996, in the Euroarea and more than twice as high as the Euroarea average. However, the continuation of this successful record requires sustained efforts towards budget consolidation and simplifying bureaucracy. Indeed, provided policies remain focused on promoting the necessary structural reforms and that there are no disorderly upheavals on the international front, the Greek economy should continue to perform well.

Mervyn King: Through the looking glass – reform of the international institutions  Text of the Inaugural International Distinguished Lecture by Mr Mervyn King, Governor of the Bank of England, to the Melbourne Centre for Financial Studies, Melbourne, 21 December 2006. *      *      * 1.  What does globalisation mean? Humpty Dumpty said to Alice, “When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less”. So let me explain first what I mean by “globalisation”. In his excellent book Why Globalization Works, Martin Wolf remarks, “Globalization is a hideous word of obscure meaning, coined in the 1960s, that came into ever-greater vogue in the 1990s”. I think of globalisation as a process of increasing international economic integration accompanied by political agreement on the rules of the game which govern that process. The rise of China and India as trading powers is an example of increasing integration. And the accession of China into the World Trade Organisation is an example of the application of the rules of the game. Globalisation is the driving force of many of the most significant changes in our economies. But it is far from a new phenomenon – it is as old as the human race itself. The European settlement of Australia represented the globalising forces of migration and capital flows over several centuries. To me one of the most poignant symbols of globalisation is the Australian War Memorial at Hyde Park Corner in London. In the first half of the twentieth century – described by Isaiah Berlin as “the worst century there has ever been” – thousands of Australians went to fight on the other side of the globe and to give their lives to a cause that transcended national interests. One of the consequences of globalisation is that the impact of change in one part of the world on the lives of people in other parts is growing. In areas as diverse as trade, energy, combating terrorism, climate change, and the economic consequences of massive global imbalances with capital flowing from poor to rich countries, there are now growing spillovers from decisions in one country to the lives of people in others. In contrast to the horrors of two World Wars and the Great Depression, the strains and stresses of today’s world do not seem insurmountable. How can we best deal with these challenges? When the movement of people in Manchuria from subsistence rural agriculture to industrial employment influences which industries flourish in Manchester and Melbourne, and when changes in attitudes to asset management in Beijing affect currency values and hence living standards from Birmingham to Brisbane, it is in the interest of all nation states, recognising their growing interdependence, to make commitments to each other about what they will and won’t do. Such commitments are embodied in international institutions – they are the rules of the game. Impressive offices and grand meetings are not the test of whether our international institutions are successful. The test is whether member countries are ready to make genuine commitments to each other. Without that the institutions lack any real purpose. So the subject of my talk today is why we need rules of the game to govern globalisation, and the institutions that are necessary to oversee those rules. 2.  Is the post-war settlement still relevant today? At the end of the Second World War, a new global order was put in place by the United States, Britain and their allies. One of those primarily responsible, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson, described his time as being “present at the creation” of a new global order. A range of new international institutions was created – the United Nations, the two Bretton Woods institutions (the IMF and World Bank), the OEEC that implemented the Marshall Plan (and later became the OECD) , NATO, and GATT (which has subsequently been succeeded by the World Trade Organisation). Those institutions are now, for the most part, past their 60th birthdays. And there has been much heart-searching over the past few years as to their role and governance. Unless the spirit of the original founders is rekindled, there is a real danger that the present institutions will wither on the vine leaving us with a more unstable and fragile international environment. As Martin Wolf pointedly wrote, “To defend a liberal world economy is not to defend the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organisation or any specific institution. These must be judged – and reformed or BIS Review 126/2006 1 
discarded – on their merits”. My argument is simple. Existing institutions were designed for a world radically different from that of today. The cost of closing them down and building new institutions is high. So we must work with our existing institutions and make them more relevant to today’s problems. Unless we do so it will be harder to defend an open and liberal international economic order which has brought benefits to hundreds of millions of people around the globe. The generic challenge facing all the post-war institutions is to find a role relevant to present circumstances, and to decide on the operational capabilities and instruments which that role requires. Holding meetings and issuing communiqués is not enough. As a central banker, I naturally focus more on the IMF, and I shall do that today. But the lessons are general. It is worth noting the scale of the challenge. The specific commitments made at the end of the Second World War are no longer relevant. The shared experience of the Great Depression, protectionism and two World Wars has faded. And the majority of current nation states were not “present at the creation”. The world has certainly changed since 1945, and it is the nature of those changes which underpins the case for reform. The world today is different from that at the creation of the post-war settlement in two important respects. First, despite the increasing integration of the world economy, which might appear to reduce the effect of national policies, the nation state has in fact flourished since 1945. The collapse of ideology and empire, and the triumph of the ideas of a liberal market economy, have been accompanied by an extraordinary expansion in the number of countries in the world. In 1946 there were fewer than 80 countries. Now there are 192 members of the UN. Much of that increase represents the division of empires, such as the former Soviet Union, into new states, as well as growing ethnic separation. Most of these new countries were not “present at the creation” and see no reason why they should acquiesce in governance arrangements made in their absence. And the economic weight of countries has changed greatly since the post-war international institutions were set up. In 1950, Asian countries accounted for a sixth of world GDP measured at purchasing power parity. Now they account for more than a third. Second, the world economy is very different today than when the IMF, the World Bank, and the other international economic institutions were set up. At the end of the Second World War, the international monetary system was built around fixed exchange rates and controls on capital flows. The rules of the game were simple. Countries were supposed to balance their current account. When “imbalances” arose, they were under an obligation to correct them. In practice, however, the obligations on creditor and debtor countries did not prove to be symmetric. Over time the advantages of capital flows, particularly in the private sector, became apparent, and in a world without capital controls, it is possible to maintain independent monetary policies only by allowing exchange rates to float. So the Bretton Woods system eventually proved unsustainable, and today most advanced industrial countries have floating exchange rates and free movement of capital. Private capital flows now dwarf official flows. And “imbalances” can apparently persist almost indefinitely. The US current account deficit, now almost 7% of GDP, has been over 3% ever since 1999. Australia has run a persistent current account deficit since 1973. Accordingly, the international institutions have shifted the focus of their attention from current to capital account flows and to the fragility of national balance sheets. Those changes have meant that, over time, the post-war settlement has become less relevant. But the need for international institutions has increased. Our own standards of living are now, more than ever, affected by decisions elsewhere. And many people already feel they are losers from globalisation. The number of workers in the world trading system has more than doubled in a short period, with inevitable consequences for real wages of the unskilled in the industrialised world. Governments are having to work harder to explain what the principle of comparative advantage means to people in their daily lives. In fact, most people are winners from globalisation. China is now the second largest buyer of Australian exports. And the Australian terms of trade have risen by 40% since 2000, providing a substantial boost to the growth rate of real incomes. Nothing could be more damaging to the prospects of developing and developed countries alike than the abandonment of further trade liberalisation. But protectionist sentiments are abroad again, even with high employment rates around the world. In Europe they are concealed as cries for “national champions”; in Latin America as populism; in the United States as complaints about unfair competition. But the damage that protectionism can wreak is clear – the experience of the Great Depression should be enough to ring alarm bells. If that is to be avoided and we are to maintain widespread support for an open international trading system, it is in all our interests to establish clear rules for what we will and won’t do in areas where our 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
decisions affect stability elsewhere. And if those commitments are to be upheld, we will need international institutions. The role of international institutions was thrown into sharp relief last week by the visit to Beijing of the new US Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, and a high-level team for a “strategic economic dialogue” with the Chinese Government. The issues discussed – the Chinese strategy for economic development and its implications for the pace of the shift of labour from rural agriculture to urban industry, saving rates in the United States, financial reform in China, and certainly the dollar-renminbi exchange rate – are all in the purview of several multilateral bodies, such as the new IMF multilateral consultation, the bi-annual IMFC meetings, the BIS, the G7, the G20, and so on. Progress at bilateral meetings is to be welcomed. Indeed, the existing multilateral forums may simply be too cumbersome or inefficient for any useful dialogue to occur. But many of the most pressing economic concerns cannot easily be handled in a bilateral setting. For example, even the infamous international “imbalances” can no longer be seen as a bilateral phenomenon: a large US trade deficit matched by a large Chinese trade surplus. Following the rise in oil prices over the past two years, the largest current account imbalances are to be found in the oil-producing countries. The combined trade surplus of OPEC in 2006 is likely to be around $400 billion, compared with a surplus in China of $150 billion. The pattern of trade imbalances and exchange rate movements is inherently a multilateral one, and real progress requires dialogue in a multilateral setting. 3.  What are the principles of institutional design? Changes to the number of nation states and the way they interact mean that reform of our multilateral institutions is needed. But piecemeal reforms are unlikely to work. In my view, there are five principles that should be followed. First, create international institutions only when there is a need to do so. International institutions should focus on those areas of global governance where we need to tackle problems collectively – whether on trade, the environment, or large spillover effects of changes in macroeconomic policy. Second, ensure that the commitments countries enter into are clear. The job of institutions is to support those commitments. In many cases, like an umpire, their job will be to uphold them. That will only be possible if the players – countries – are very clear about the agreed rules of the game. Without that, any further design is pointless. Third, provide institutions with the necessary tools to umpire the commitments of nation states. But, just as umpires are accountable for their performance to the whole community of cricket-playing nations through the International Cricket Council, the staff and management of the international institution should be accountable to the whole community of nation states for their performance in upholding the rules. Fourth, recognise that we do not start with a blank sheet of paper. We must accept the constraints of history. Existing institutions have an institutional memory, talented staff and much of the infrastructure that will be needed in the future. But that is not to say reform will be easy – there are far too many vested interests for that to be the case. Fifth, avoid unnecessary duplication. Because the cost of abolishing institutions is high, the number of international groupings and institutions has proliferated in recent years. Many of them tread on each others toes. As a result, the IMF, World Bank and OECD, have all been bruised. Duplication of roles is wasteful of time, money and focus. Each institution should have one very clear remit, and focus on it. Of course, countries which play a role in one institution but not in another will have an incentive to build up the role of the former at the expense of the latter. So it is up to the member countries to limit the battle for turf. There are few examples where all these principles appear to have been followed. The World Trade Organisation has been an effective umpire of countries’ commitments about trade restrictions and comes close. But the example of the WTO highlights the importance, above all else, of clear commitments from nation states themselves. The failure of countries to conclude a multilateral trade round since the WTO was formed more than a decade ago is worrying. The Doha round has continued past its expected completion date and only a brave commentator would forecast eventual success. The fault does not lie with the WTO. Instead, it reflects the fact that national governments have not been willing to make the necessary commitments. BIS Review 126/2006 3 
4.  What do those principles mean for the IMF? With those principles in mind, I want to consider the challenge of reforming the IMF. (a) Do we need an IMF? The apparent success of central banks has led some economists to argue that the widespread adoption of inflation targets and floating exchange rates is sufficient to ensure the smooth running of the international monetary system – a regime which Professor Andrew Rose calls the ‘reverse Bretton Woods system’. There is no need for an international institution such as the IMF to watch over the system. It is certainly true that the most important thing any nation state can do to minimise the spillover effects it has on others is to maintain domestic economic stability. And that is exactly what Australia, Britain, and other countries have done during the recent period of economic success, known as the “Great Stability”. But domestic stability is not sufficient to eliminate spillover effects. The impact of national macroeconomic policy decisions is transmitted to other countries through important prices in the world economy: real exchange rates; real interest rates, and prices of important commodities like oil. Changes in spending by US households affect export demand in the rest of the world, both directly and indirectly through movements in the dollar. Changes in saving by governments in Asia affect spending in the rest of the world through movements in real interest rates. Changes in the supply of oil from the Middle East affect incomes and spending elsewhere through movements in oil prices. Moreover, not everyone has a floating exchange rate and an inflation target, and countries that try to prevent adjustment of their real exchange rates have exacerbated the problem of spillover effects. Businesses in every country are conscious of how quickly their plans can be disrupted by unpredictable swings in exchange rates, asset prices and commodity prices. When those spillovers are sufficiently large and widespread, countries will want to engage with each other in a multilateral setting to discuss how they should be resolved. (b) What commitments are needed? Before the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the specific commitments made by countries to each other were very clear: fixed exchange rates and capital controls. In the wake of the collapse of Bretton Woods, the members of the IMF attempted to re-define their commitments. But the exercise of defining what practical commitments were needed focussed primarily on exchange rates and had rather little effect in practice. Two broad commitments are particularly important. First, countries should make public commitments about their targets for macroeconomic policies – fiscal, monetary and financial. That still allows countries considerable discretion in their choice of policy framework – for example, whether to adopt a fixed or floating exchange rate. Second, policy frameworks must be consistent across countries. Policies which try to prevent changes in real exchange rates in response to changes in fundamentals, or lead to an unsustainable build-up of external debt, are properly the concern of the international community. (c)  What tools are needed? The main tool to monitor those commitments is surveillance. The surveillance activities of the IMF have been criticised because they pay insufficient attention to spillover effects and instead examine in unnecessary detail microeconomic issues. For example, the sharp rise in oil prices over the past two years has posed a risk to economic stability in many countries. But there is no reference in the IMF’s Article IV report on China to the role that Chinese demand may have played in pushing up world oil prices. And the report on the United States this year singled out the electricity sector and competition among auto manufacturers and airlines as areas warranting special examination by IMF staff. It would be better if those microeconomic issues were examined within the OECD, and, in turn, issues of macroeconomic spillovers and global “imbalances” were left to the IMF. But even when IMF surveillance has been well-focussed, as in the analysis of Thailand’s exchange rate policies in 1996, it has not always carried sufficient weight to influence countries’ policies. 4 BIS Review 126/2006 
These short-comings must be remedied in two ways. First, the focus of IMF surveillance should be on spillover effects and the consistency of macroeconomic policy frameworks. By the Spring Meetings of the IMF in Washington in April, we shall know whether this is likely when we see the results of the current review of the 1977 decision on exchange rate surveillance. Second, IMF surveillance should be more independent of member countries. That will allow clear messages to be delivered about whether countries are living up to their commitments. A remit should be set annually. It will play two roles: it will give the IMF a clear mandate to guide its surveillance activities and it will give the shareholders a yardstick against which to hold the IMF staff accountable. Greater independence for staff should be accompanied by greater accountability. (d)  What are the constraints of history? The Bretton Woods conference at which the IMF was established was attended by the governments of just 44 countries. Yet even that was fraught. It would be vastly more difficult to agree a complete new treaty with 184 countries. The IMF has much of the infrastructure and expertise that will be needed to do the job I have described – and an annual budget of $1 billion to do it. That is why it makes sense to attempt to reform the IMF that we have inherited rather than to build a new institution. But the inherited governance structure of the IMF and other institutions complicates matters. The founders of the post-war settlement encumbered several of the new international institutions with unwieldy full-time resident boards. And the distribution of voting rights no longer reflects the economic and political weight of member countries. The task of agreeing on a new system will be enormously difficult. But if we fail, the influence of the institutions will diminish further, possibly irreparably. Reform of IMF surveillance and voting rights of member countries complement each other. Voting rights are an area where hard work and many hours of persuasion will be needed if countries are to be convinced to see the bigger picture and relinquish some degree of direct control over the IMF in return for the creation of a more effective institution. Hard work, perseverance and dogged determination have been characteristics of this year’s Australian presidency of the G20 under Peter Costello, Ian MacFarlane and Glenn Stevens. Their efforts have been crucial to the progress that has been made towards quota reform over the past year. It is important that the Australian legacy be carried forward if the process of quota reform is to be completed. (e)  Are there overlaps with other institutions? Unnecessary duplication is a waste of both time and money. I have already spoken about the respective comparative advantages of the IMF and OECD. There has also been some discussion about the roles of the IMF and the G7 in respect of exchange rate issues. Over the past three years – especially since the Boca Raton G7 summit of February 2004 – the inability of the G7 to deal with the major spillover effects in the world economy has become more and more evident. Adding new members, even if they were willing to join, is not the answer. More productive would be to use the IMF as flexible forum to bring the relevant group of countries together to handle issues as and when they arise. 5.  Conclusions The meetings of the IMF in Washington and Singapore this year marked the beginning of an attempt to define more clearly the role of the Fund in the world economy. Whether that will prove successful is too early to tell. But the challenge is clear. Globalisation increases our dependence on each other. It is no longer sufficient to rely on the commitments made sixty years ago – the world has changed too much since then. It is up to the member countries to make a multilateral trading system work. As Joseph Conrad wrote a century ago in his great novel Nostromo, “Action is consolatory. It is the enemy of thought and the friend of flattering illusions”. The frenetic activity of international meetings and the flattering illusions of a stream of communiqués do not add up to a coherent set of commitments. Failure to reform the international institutions will condemn them to irrelevance and obscurity. We are at that point. If this generation fails, then the work of those who were “present at the creation” will have been undone. It is our duty to re-create the institutional framework that we inherited.

It will not be easy. But in case like Alice you are tempted to think that, “There’s no use trying; one can’t believe impossible things”, remember the Queen’s reply: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast”. 6 BIS Review 126/2006 
Jean-Claude Trichet: Interview with Ta Nea, Der Tagesspiegel and Luxemburger Wort Interview of Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, conducted on 11 December 2006 by Ms Irini Chrysolora (Ta Nea), Mr Moritz Döbler (Der Tagesspiegel) and Mr Pierre Leyers (Luxemburger Wort), published on 18 December 2006. *      *      * Can you please describe the current risks of inflation in Europe?  We have, in the eyes of the Governing Council, as I expressed on 7 December in my press conference, several risks. One is the pass-through of past increases in the price of oil and raw commodities that have not yet materialised in the consumer prices. We have also the risk of further increases in oil and commodity prices which we have to take into account. We have the risk of administered prices and indirect taxes being augmented on top of what has already been decided. And, more fundamentally, we have also risks that are associated with the so called “second round effects”, namely the spiraling of the wages and unit labour cost reflecting inflation fears and feeding inflation. Until now the last risk did not materialise. It is very important that it does not materialise because when it does, it is too late and very hard to get back to price stability. How close are we to the second round effects that you have mentioned?  There are signs that some risks might augment in this respect. It is one of the reasons why in the last meeting of the Governing Council special attention was given to this. It’s important that we keep unit labour cost, wages and salaries in good order so as not to give rise to these “second round effects”. You appeal to the responsibility of social partners. What would you consider to be a reasonable wage increase?  Social partners should not forget that we have unemployment at too high levels in Europe and that we also have different levels of productivity and of cost competitiveness in the various economies of the euro area member states. If we want sustainable growth and job creation a high level of responsibility is of the essence.  Most analysts interpreted your latest decision as implying that there are going to be more interest rate hikes next year, in particular two more, so that the euro interest rate reaches the level of 4 percent. Why do you believe they have come to this conclusion?  We have to be faithful to our mandate to ensure price stability. I said during my press conference that acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability is warranted. Everybody knows that we will do what is necessary to deliver price stability. We are like a crew on a ship. We know where we have to go, there is no doubt about our objective: price stability. What one does not know is whether and when there will be a tempest, whether and when the sea will be calm, whether we will have headwind or tailwind. On this everybody can make up his own mind. And if there are different views in the market, it is because there are different assumptions on what will be necessary for us in order to deliver price stability. But everybody knows that the crew of the ship will take all necessary decisions to arrive at its destination. Your comments after the last Governing Council were interpreted differently by different people. Is that something that you actually aim for, that there is no clear signal?  What the market has perfectly understood is that we will do whatever is necessary, without tying our hands ex ante. The proof is that inflation expectations are well anchored. Opinions might differ on the overall environment, on what will happen exactly in this vast European economy of 315 million people, what will happen in the rest of the world, what are the new chances, opportunities and risks that might appear. Acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability is warranted. The ship knows where it goes. Sometimes you have to adjust the course of the ship…  That’s the reason why we do not pre-commit in the medium term. The members of the Governing Council are often described as belonging to different fractions. Some are “doves” others are “hawks”. To which fraction do you belong?  BIS Review 126/2006 1 
As President of the ECB I am speaking on behalf of the Governing Council of the ECB. It is an oversimplification to sum up the positions of the various members of the Governing Council in that fashion. We have a profoundly united Governing Council, the decision making entity in the ECB is the Governing Council itself and not any fraction of it. Each of us is working as responsible for the stability of the complete euro area, none of us represents any particular interest, any particular economy or nation. Moreover, I consider that the collegial wisdom is fundamental, namely each of us is incorporating the wisdom and the views of all the others and reserve the right to change his or her own approach depending on this interaction. As President I am the warrantor that the Governing Council is up to its Treaty mandate: price stability. What can the ECB do to have a better control of the money supply?  The monetary pillar in our strategy is important. As you know we cross check results of the economic analysis and of the monetary analysis. We have ample liquidity in the euro area. As an example, the rate of growth of the outstanding loans to the non-financial corporations was 12.9 percent over the last 12 months. This shows that credit is presently abundant in Europe.  What do you think of the so called housing bubble? Do you think there is one in Europe and if so what are the dangers for the European economy?  We have to look very carefully at the euro area as a whole. There is evidently no such bubble in Germany, whereas in a number of other countries there is an accumulation of price increases of the last years, suggesting that close and careful monitoring is warranted. I don’t have a diagnosis of a bubble in the euro area as a whole, but what we see in some parts of the euro area calls for very close attention. So we have to be alert.  Are you concerned that by raising the interest rates you might stop the main source of growth, as many see it, which is housing?  By raising interest rates, as we did last week, we are contributing decisively to the sustainability of growth. If we don’t ensure price stability then growth will not be sustainable. That has to be clearly understood. We are not hampering growth! Not at all. On the contrary, we are permitting growth to be sustainable in the medium and long run. The mandate to ensure price stability over time – which has been given to us by the Treaty – is there because it is a condition for sustainable growth and job creation.  Are you concerned that a number of households which have accumulated big debts in the past will face serious problems paying them back in the future because of the interest rate hikes that you have decided during the last year?  I would ask those households which feel that interest rates are too high at the moment to compare with the interest rates they had in the same economies before the introduction of the euro!  But households tend to forget what happened before the euro. And some of them have accumulated big debts during the last two to three years and now they may be facing difficulties in servicing them. Do you have a golden rule to suggest to the households, so that they are not exposed to too many dangers?  If we want growth and job creation to be sustainable, thanks to price stability, interest rates themselves have to move. Borrowers know that interest rates can go up as well as down. Greek citizens are paying considerably higher interest rates than other euro countries citizens. Why do you think this is happening? Is competition not working in the banking system?  We in the Governing Council, including Lucas Papademos, our Vice-President, and Nicolas Garganas, the Governor of the Bank of Greece, are calling for financial integration to be as complete as possible. In certain domains we can be reasonably satisfied, in others progress has to be made. It is clear that in retail banking progress must be made. We see that, even with the same currency and monetary policy, there are differences in the level of interest rates. But you also have to take into consideration that these interest rates are incorporating the credit risks of the loans. So one can understand that there might be some remaining differences.  The competitiveness of the Greek economy is low. What measures would you suggest to improve it?  In many respects the whole of the euro area has exactly the same characteristics and can receive the same recommendation as Greece itself: structural reforms are necessary. We need reforms that 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
permit goods and services markets to be more flexible, to function better and to be more fully integrated in this vast continental economy which is the euro area. Flexibility is also needed in the financial markets. Financial integration should be completed and it is very important for the efficient functioning of the euro area. Labour market improvements also have to be taken into account if we want the whole economy to be competitive. I would draw particular attention – and I am not talking particularly of Greece, but of the entire euro area - to fiscal policy which has to respect fully not only the letter but also the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact. Meaning that in good times one should save money for the bad times. We also have to follow the unit labour cost carefully. Because unit labour cost is one of the important indicators to measure overall competitiveness.  What is your comment on the rapid decrease of the German deficit level?  It is very good that the German government has expressed its full commitment to strictly fulfil the Stability and Growth Pact. This resolute commitment is very positive for Germany and for Europe as a whole. Has the new government made a difference?  As you know, we are issuing the currency and preserving price stability for all, for all sensitivities in a fully multi-partisan way. I would say it was very good that Germany embarked on such a fiscal commitment. The progress made in cost competitiveness during the last years was also good. In Germany, VAT is about to rise by three percentage points. How harmful is such a tax hike to price stability in the euro zone?  It is a decision that was taken a long time ago and was incorporated in our projections since then. It is clear that it has an impact on growth in Germany and Europe – we will have to see how much exactly. There is a mainstream consideration that there will be a little hump in the present last quarter of this year and a little bit of a slump in the first quarter of next year. We will see. But those who think that it will affect the German economy – and therefore the economy of Europe – very profoundly are not very numerous anymore. What structural reforms are necessary in Germany and Europe as a whole?  For Germany and Europe as a whole the message is the same: actively continue to implement structural reforms. The goal is to be flexible, to adapt to an environment that is changing very rapidly. It is important for Germany, the first economy in Europe. It is important for Europe as a whole. And those reforms are paying off when we look at Ireland or Denmark, for instance. Does size matter? Is it easier for Denmark?  I don’t think so. There are many other examples of bigger countries like Canada or Australia. Those flexible economies which have done well, which are prosperous and leading in job creation. I think it’s the privilege of countries where public opinion sees more clearly that everybody is better off when the economy as a whole is more flexible. You named countries that make progress. Could you also specify euro zone countries that have difficulties in adapting?  All countries in Europe, and amongst them the three big ones Germany, France and Italy have more or less difficulties to adapt.  But let me add something. We see what we lose by not having done all those reforms. We could be better off, we could have more prosperity, more growth, more jobs. But it would equally be a mistake to think that nothing has been achieved in the Euro area. I will give you a figure that shows what I mean: Since the euro has been set up, 11.5 million jobs were created in the euro area. Now, what would you say how many jobs were created in the United States during that same period of time? No idea. Twice as much?  7.2 million jobs! We created since the setting up of the euro much more jobs than the US! We have to recognise that some characteristics of the euro area are better than they are sometimes perceived even if unemployment is still much too high. Don’t misunderstand me: That is not to say that we did enough reforms. It is to say: We should not be discouraged. We have the capacity to implement reforms and they will pay off.  BIS Review 126/2006 3 
Germany has often been dubbed “the sick man of Europe”. How accurate is that description nowadays?  I always considered this description wrong and I think my sentiment is shared by my colleagues in the Governing Council, by Jürgen Stark and by Axel Weber. Germany was going through a long period of catching-up, of overcoming the loss of competitiveness, the difficulties it had after the reunification – for obvious reasons that were unavoidable at the time. The productive sector in Germany has done a very important job of improving its cost competitiveness over the last eight years. This provides the basis for being the number one exporter in the world. But Germany, like all Europe, still has a lot to do in terms of structural reforms. This position is about to be challenged by China. Can Germany, can Europe even compete in terms of costs with China or India?  We are an economy of 315 million people. It is a vast economy, slightly larger in terms of population than the size of the United States. In order to preserve our high standard of living and employment we have to permanently adapt. Flexibility and creativity are key in a world that is changing extremely rapidly. In your latest introductory statement, you said that the monetary policy remained „accommodative“. Some political commentators disagree and say you were hurting further recovery of the European economy. What do you say to those critics?  I insist that we defend the purchasing power of those who are in the weakest situation in our societies. It is those who are primarily hurt by inflation. Surveys are showing that our fellow citizens are strongly calling upon us to do our job. They are not asking for less alertness of their central bank as regards price stability. They are asking for more alertness. They are not entirely satisfied with the present level of inflation in Europe and they are encouraging us to delver price stability. If we would let inflation emerge against the interests of younger people, against the interests of workers, against the interests of the least fortunate segment of society, we would also create an obstacle to sustainable growth and job creation. I feel very strongly about this. The Treaty was well written.  French presidential candidate Segolène Royal and other politicians of your home country have demanded the ECB should be subject to political decisions. What is your comment?  We are independent because it has been decided by our political democracies. As you know the ECB is an apolitical institution working for the sake of all 315 million fellow citizens whatever their sensitivities. The Treaty of Maastricht has created an independent institution that works for all sensitivities, without any exceptions. And we are proud of that. The people asked for us to do our job independently through a Treaty that has been signed by all governments and ratified by all parliaments by the people of Europe directly, which was the case in France. It is true that creating an independent institution was a very important decision. In France it called for a change of the Constitution of the fifth Republic, a change which was voted on 25th June 1992 with a qualified majority (3/5) by the Congress in Versailles.  In recent months, there have been several reports about corruption involving large European companies, for instance Siemens. How harmful are cases like that?  We pay great attention to the fight against money laundering as well as against terrorism financing. To the extent that criminal activity is involved, I am sure that the national authorities will do all what is necessary. The German banking system may change fundamentally now that the Landesbank Berlin is on the market and can be purchased by any buyer. What do think of this potential change?  Amongst the structural reforms you have the financial integration and the completion of the single financial market in the single currency area. From that standpoint a number of features of the German banking system do not fit well yet. Full opening up of the public segment of the banking sector would be in the interest of Germany and in the interest of Europe as a whole.  But if you leave this one example out, the kind of reform process you are calling for is not making headway in Germany at all.  I know that it is fairly difficult. Again I cannot help mentioning the fact that it would be in the superior interest of everybody involved to achieve such a reform. What kind of time span do you have in mind?  4 BIS Review 126/2006 
That is up to the responsible authorities. I am not going to mention a date. But as the ECB I can only say how important this step would be. Growth in the US is slowing down. What needs to be done to achieve a soft landing instead of a hard landing?  We follow very carefully the situation. Our scenario is the scenario of the Federal Reserve System, a soft slowing down, which is presently observed. How harmful is the current dollar-euro ratio? Do you see the value of the dollar on the rise again in the next few months?  On the euro-dollar relation I would confirm to you what I have already said: I signed myself, together with the other members of the G7, a communiqué in Singapore which said in particular: „Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth.“ I also noted the declarations of Secretary Paulson that “a strong dollar is clearly in the interest of the United States.” How high will you allow the euro to go?  I will not say anything more. These sentences speak by themselves.  How is your relationship with M. Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the Eurogroup?  It’s good. The responsibility of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the Eurogroup is extremely important. He has within the Eurogroup a huge domain with all Ministers of Finance where appropriate discussion and cooperation in particular in the fiscal policy and the structural policies are fundamental. He is an excellent President of the Eurogroup. Europe has progressed as a political union not in a parallel way with monetary union.  We are not a full fledged federation. It is also clear that the constitutional treaty – which would be an important improvement in the functioning of the present European institutions – has not been approved, even if now, after the ratification by Finland, 16 countries have ratified the Constitution. That being said, we do have a combination of monetary union and economic union – EMU – which I strongly trust is viable and credible – including the Stability and Growth Pact and the will of governments to discuss and cooperate as regards fiscal and structural policies. As a citizen I would call for going forward in achieving political union. As President of the ECB I repeat that I consider EMU highly credible with its Stability and Growth Pact.  There is a lot of controversy about who should be able to join the EU. Do you see the same kind of controversy about who should be able to join the euro zone?  These are two completely different issues. The entry in the European Union is an important decision. Once you are in the European Union, the issue at stake is to meet the Maastricht criteria. As we are in favour of a strict implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, we are in favour of a rigorous implementation of the Maastricht criteria. It’s in the interest of all – of those who want to enter the euro area, and of the euro area itself. The decision which was recently taken by the European council on a proposal of the Commission – to approve Slovenia as a member of the euro area - has proven that the euro area is not a closed shop. I'm confident on the progressive enlargement of the euro area, - fully respecting the treaty provisions.  So, as long as they respect the Maastricht criteria, there is no limit to the number of euro member countries?  No. And as you know the decision making process inside the ECB is prepared and will be adapted to remain efficient, whatever the number of participants in the euro area is. After eight, or rather – for the European citizens – after five years, would you say that the euro is accepted as THE European currency?  Undoubtedly, yes. The people of Europe ask us to do our job. They want prices to be stable. Achieving that, we also do the best for growth and job creation. The message is very clear and it comes from each and every country. We have to be faithful to the treaty, to our mandate, to the people of Europe. As an independent institution we are accountable to the people of Europe. It is true that in some countries there is still a sentiment that the prices are going up more than the inflation indicator is telling. We do not share that opinion. But in any case the message is crystal clear: continue to do your job with outmost dedication.  BIS Review 126/2006 5 
But common people do still doubt the accuracy of price statistics.  That perception has nothing to do with the euro, of course. We have full confidence that the price statistics that are produced at the national level and processed at the European level are correct. The methodology which is used is state of the art.  The ECB is still a young institution. In which areas do you see room for improvement?  The success of the euro is a success of this institution and of the Eurosystem - the team of central banks. On the first of January 2007 we will be fourteen in the team, the ECB and the thirteen national central banks. It is that team spirit which is our most precious asset. We will continue to improve our team spirit to the service of Europe and its 315 million fellow citizens of the euro area.  6 BIS Review 126/2006 
Stanley Fischer: Dollarization Keynote address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the 75th Anniversary Conference of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey "Dollarization: Consequences and Policy Options", Istanbul, 13-15 December 2006. *      *      * It is both a pleasure and an honor for me to participate in this conference of the Central Bank of Turkey. In the first place, it is a pleasure to be at a conference of the Central Bank at a time when it is evident that monetary policy in Turkey is succeeding in gradually bringing inflation under control. Inflation is now around the single digit range, and given the experience in other countries – including Israel – that struggled to subdue inflation, it is reasonable to expect that with a sustained and consistent monetary policy, and the continuation of the supportive fiscal policy, Turkey will join other inflation targeting countries in achieving low single digit inflation. All this is a far cry from the situation during one of my most memorable visits to your country, on February 19, 2001, the day of the spectacular foreign exchange crisis that led to the shift to a flexible exchange rate regime and the beginnings of the inflation targeting approach to monetary policy. The Turkish economy has come a long way since then, and the credit for that belongs both to the Central Bank and to successive Turkish governments – both the ministers and the senior civil servants – who have demonstrated the ability to maintain fiscal discipline and continue the reforms that are transforming the economy and bringing it closer to its potential. Of course, the IMF too has made an important contribution to the success of this process, and I am happy that as a member of the Fund and the Fund team, I had the opportunity to work closely with the Turkish authorities. Second, it is an honor for me as Governor of the Bank of Israel to be taking part in a conference on the important topic of dollarization, a topic of interest not only to the Central Bank of Turkey, but also to us in the Bank of Israel, and to many other central banks and economies around the world. I will start by discussing the issue of full dollarization of an economy, that is the replacement of the national currency by a foreign currency, a process that has taken place in recent years in both El Salvador and Ecuador. I will then go on to discuss what must be the main topic of this conference – partial dollarization, with respect both to the assets and liabilities in the economy, and with respect also to the medium of exchange and the unit of account in some transactions. I. Full dollarization During the 1990s many economies were struggling to control or stabilize inflation. Many of them had used a pegged exchange rate to bring inflation down from triple digit levels. It was then that the power of the impossible trinity – of the combination of a pegged exchange rate, free capital movements, and a monetary policy dedicated to domestic goals – became clear, and that a series of financial crises erupted. Further, as the financial crises of that decade unfolded, it also became evident that the impossible trinity should be amended to say that the combination of a pegged exchange rate, free capital movements, and macroeconomic policy – not just monetary policy – dedicated to domestic goals was not possible. The resultant trilemma pointed in three possible directions: one was to attempt to control international capital flows, a solution that for good reasons was rejected by most countries1; the second was to move to a more flexible exchange rate – though not necessarily one that was totally free-floating; and the third was to strengthen the exchange rate peg, either by adopting a currency board, or by getting rid of the exchange rate entirely, that is by adopting a foreign currency, or full dollarization. The major benefit of the third solution as seen at the time – and as emphasized particularly by my then-colleague Michael Deppler of the IMF – was that a country that adopted that solution would                                                       1  Among these reasons is that capital controls tend to: cut the development of the financial sector of the country off from the global economy; cut the economy off from the benefits of international trade in assets; and are frequently ineffective and a source of corruption. However, countries with capital controls, a weak macroeconomic framework, and a vulnerable financial system, need to strengthen the macroeconomic system and the financial system before or as they liberalize. BIS Review 126/2006 1 
rapidly see the benefits of the enhanced credibility of monetary policy in lower interest rates. When one considers for instance the case of Turkey, where high real interest rates in the late 1990s and in the run-up to the crisis created a massive fiscal problem2, the benefits of the lower interest rates were obvious. Those benefits had been seen in the case of Bulgaria when it adopted a currency board solution, a step just short of full dollarization, and they were seen also in the full dollarization cases of El Salvador and Ecuador in the early years of this decade. They were seen too in the cases of the countries joining, or slated to join, the EMU. The benefits of instant credibility were expected to be observed also in a rapid decline in the inflation rate. That benefit was not immediately obtained in the high inflation countries, with prices continuing to rise at double digit rates for nearly three years in the case of Ecuador, a result of the extreme real devaluation of the currency during the crisis that preceded dollarization. Evidently, Balassa-Samuelson effects would continue to operate – and to operate strongly – even in a country that had adopted the currency of another country, an effect that was also visible in the currency board cases of the Baltic countries. More generally, adherence to a currency board or to full dollarization was expected to strengthen overall macroeconomic discipline, in the belief that a government committed to such a policy would have no choice but to maintain fiscal discipline. Part of the reason for that belief was that the authorities would understand that the macroeconomic effects of failing to maintain the exchange rate peg – one on which the entire financial structure of the economy was dependent – would be disastrous. Unfortunately, that theory did not withstand the unfolding of the Argentine crisis. It was true that the collapse of a long-established and relatively long believed-in currency peg was extremely expensive for Argentina. But it was not clear that there was a better way out of the deep crisis in which Argentina found itself at the end of 2001. More generally, when using game theory to evaluate the beneficial effects of imposing large costs on policymakers for breaking a commitment – as in the case of Argentina in the 1990s – it is necessary to take into account the expected costs of breaking the commitment if circumstances arise in which policymakers nonetheless decide that is what they have to do. The costs of even a fully credible full dollarization policy are also clear: they are that the exchange rate is no longer available as an adjustment mechanism: adjustments that could otherwise be made by allowing the exchange rate to change – and that is the most natural adjustment mechanism to macroeconomic shocks, foreign and domestic – then have to be transferred to domestic prices and wages. And that generally means a more painful and prolonged adjustment. All this raises the question of what are the costs and benefits of membership in a monetary union, an issue of great future importance to Turkey, and one with which I will conclude this presentation. II.  Partial dollarization In situations with partial dollarization, at least two currencies are being used, to differing extents, to perform the different functions of money – as unit of account, medium of exchange, and store of value.3 For instance, it is common that the domestic money be used as legal tender, but that some foreign currency be used as unit of account in some transactions, and as a store of value – either directly, or via various indexation arrangements. In some countries, two or more currencies may circulate and serve as medium of exchange for different transactions – the domestic currency for smaller transactions, and a foreign currency for large transactions, for instance for real estate. The term "dollarization" generally refers to the assets and liabilities in use within an economy, and not to those either borrowed from or held abroad, although the impact of exchange rate changes on the domestic economy may be quite similar in the two cases.                                                       2  The emphasis in IMF programs on the primary surplus of the budget – that is, the non-interest surplus – to some extent deflected attention from the depth of Turkey's fiscal problem at that time. 3  In this section I draw on the papers presented in the book edited by Adriano Armas, Alain Ize, and Eduardo Levy Yeyati, Financial Dollarization: The Policy Agenda, International Monetary Fund, 2006. 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
Typically partial dollarization is the result of a period of economic instability in the past, generally a period of high inflation. In such circumstances, economic agents will want to hold safer assets4, and the economic and political systems will produce them. That can be done by allowing the banking system to offer foreign currency, or exchange-rate-linked, accounts; and the banking system in turn will want to lend in a similar form. Dollarization typically has a long life, generally surviving long after the period of instability that gave rise to the phenomenon. It is useful to distinguish four types of dollarization: (i) asset dollarization; (ii) liability dollarization; (iii) medium of exchange dollarization in which a foreign currency is used for some transactions; and (iv) unit of account dollarization, in which future payments are indexed to an exchange rate. The last is sometimes called "real" dollarization. Asset and liability dollarization The key questions that arise are whether different types of partial dollarization contribute to financial vulnerability and instability, whether and under what circumstances it would be desirable to have less dollarization, and if so, how that can be achieved. We start with asset and liability dollarization.  Consider first the impacts on the banking system of operating in two currencies, on both sides of the balance sheet. It was common in the financial crises of the 1990s to discover that banks that thought they had hedged their foreign currency liabilities (or their foreign-currency denominated liabilities) by lending in dollars, were not in fact hedged, because their non-exporting borrowers were not able to repay their dollar-denominated loans. Indeed, even if the banks thought they had a net long position in foreign-exchange denominated assets, they sometimes discovered that a deep devaluation devastated their balance sheets. Thus unless lenders are very cautious in evaluating their borrowers, partial dollarization can severely increase the vulnerability of the banking and financial systems to exchange rate changes. These exchange rate changes could be driven by foreign developments, but in practice they were more often driven by domestically generated shocks, frequently caused by fiscal problems. That is to say: asset and liability dollarization makes the financial system, and thus the economy, more vulnerable to exchange rate shocks. There has been some discussion in the literature of whether dollarization helps create financial depth. The empirical answer seems to be uncertain. But when one takes into account that economic agents will seek safer assets where they can find them, and that capital controls are never totally watertight, the answer must be that dollarization helps preserve a larger domestic financial system than would otherwise exist. For otherwise much of the financial system would move offshore. Can monetary policy be effective in a heavily dollarized economy? In one writes down the equation of exchange, MV = PY, then it seems that monetary policy can get leverage over prices through the normal quantity theory mechanisms. But there are three qualifications to that answer. First, it is not clear what the relevant M is, and whether the central bank can fully control that M. If the domestic and foreign currencies are close substitutes in terms of what matters for the equation of exchange, the central bank may not have effective control over M. Second, in heavily dollarized economies, fiscal policy is likely to be problematic, and to make it difficult for monetary policy to avoid the difficulties associated with fiscal dominance. Third, there is the question of what determines interest rates in a highly dollarized economy. If the capital account is open, rates of return on dollarized assets and liabilities in the economy are likely to be significantly affected by foreign interest rates, reducing the leverage of monetary policy on aggregate demand. To the extent that the exchange rate is flexible, there may be some leeway between foreign and domestic interest rates, giving monetary policy some leverage. Although I have not so far distinguished between dollarization and exchange-rate linking of assets and liabilities, there is a potentially important difference. So long as assets and liabilities are exchange-rate linked, and payable only in the domestic currency, the central bank still technically has the capacity to serve as lender of last resort in the domestic currency, even without holding massive reserves. But this                                                       4  The literature uses the concept of a minimum variance portfolio for the economy, which includes a significant share of foreign-currency or foreign-currency denominated assets. BIS Review 126/2006 3 
does mean that the impact on the exchange rate of a significant financial crisis is likely to be very large in an economy with extensive dollarization. Empirical work shows that monetary policy in heavily dollarized economies tends to aim to smooth the exchange rate. This is not surprising given that economic agents in such an economy are very vulnerable to exchange rate changes, and that monetary-policy makers will typically also be concerned about the stability of the financial system. In that regard, it is often suggested, and correctly, that reserve requirements against foreign currency liabilities should be larger than those against domestic currency liabilities, and that especial care needs to be taken in evaluating the risks associated with foreign currency assets. However, it is also the case that the more difficult it becomes to hold foreign-currency assets in the domestic banking system, the more those assets are likely to be held outside the banking system, quite possibly abroad – in other words, actions to limit the extent of dollarization may well contribute to capital flight. Why not simply fix the exchange rate? We have already discussed that issue, under the heading of full dollarization. It can be done, for small economies, and for ones – such as the candidates for entry into EMU – that know how they will ultimately exit the fixed exchange rate arrangement. But it is also a dangerous course of action for those countries that might one day find themselves having to change the exchange rate. There is some evidence that the provision of price-indexed financial assets helps reduce the extent of dollarization. That makes considerable sense, since the underlying issue for asset-holders is increasing the safety of their portfolios. Generally countries that suffer from high inflation, which empirically means also unstable inflation, provide a range of assets, including both price- and foreign-exchange indexed assets. But extensive price level indexation, like dollarization or exchange-rate indexation, may also complicate the response of the economy to shocks. Medium of exchange dollarization I will not discuss this issue in detail, except to note that the use of foreign exchange for making large payments may be more tax- than medium-of-exchange related. "Real" indexation – unit of account dollarization Long after a country has returned to price stability, and even after the disappearance of almost all asset and liability dollarization, a country may still find that some domestic prices are specified in dollars. This is currently the situation in Israel. During the course of the nineties, financial dollarization declined dramatically in Israel. For most of the present decade the average inflation rate has been around two percent. Nonetheless, housing and apartment rentals, and the fees for some services, including those of lawyers and accountants, are quoted in dollars. These are all fundamentally non-traded goods. This means that when the exchange rate changes in Israel, not only do the prices of imports change, and feed through gradually into the price level, in the way they do in all economies, but also the local-currency prices of a significant part of the price index react also immediately. Housing accounts for over 20 percent of the CPI. Empirical estimates show that an exchange rate change feeds through into the domestic price level within a matter of months, with the pass-through coefficient being about one-third. Because the exchange rate is volatile relative to goods prices, month-to-month inflation in Israel also relatively volatile. This complicates monetary policy. We are inflation targeters, with the inflation target being 1-3 percent. But given the volatility of oil prices and the exchange rate, we have found it difficult to stay within the range. Just in the last two months, as a result of the fall in the price of oil and the weakening of the dollar, our price level fell by 1.5 percentage points. That will ensure that we will be well below our target inflation range this year, with inflation likely to end the year at about zero. That is not a major problem given that the economy is growing fast, but we would of course prefer to be within the target range. As it is, we have adopted a flexible inflation targeting approach, in which we aim to return within the inflation range with a horizon of about one year. This approach seems to have gained considerable credibility. Further, the rapid pass-through of the exchange rate into inflation sometimes makes monetary policy easier – for when we change the interest rate and the exchange rate reacts rapidly, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is very fast. So the tight exchange rate-inflation link is 4 BIS Review 126/2006 
not only a problem, sometimes it is a benefit. But not on average, for our inflation rate reacts rapidly to every external shock that moves the exchange rate. We would prefer a slower pass-through of the exchange rate into prices, so that the inflation rate could be more stable. And the fact remains that the economy continues to pay a price, in terms of inflation volatility, for a period of high inflation that was brought under control over twenty years ago: inflation and its consequences, among them dollarization, have very long-lasting effects. III.  What to do? Given that dollarization complicates economic management, and contributes to the uncertainty that ensures its continuation, it is natural to want to get rid of the phenomenon. That is certainly a worthwhile goal when dollarization is extensive. At the same time, in a fundamentally stable economy, there are few good reasons to prevent people from holding the assets they want and from entering into the contracts they want. The first thing to do to reduce the level of dollarization is to get the macroeconomic framework in shape. That means in particular putting fiscal policy on a sustainable track. And it also means developing a monetary policy framework. For most open economies that framework should be one of inflation targeting, with exchange rate flexibility. As the macroeconomic situation stabilizes, as it is doing in Turkey, the extent of dollarization – particularly asset and liability dollarization – can be expected to start declining. For a long time it seemed that the extent of asset and liability dollarization was impervious to improved economic performance. That was certainly the impression one had looking at Latin American developments, where for instance Bolivia stabilized from hyperinflation in the mid-1980s, but the banking system continued to be over 80 percent dollarized into the present century. Now however we have several examples of countries that have dedollarized successfully on the asset and liability sides, including Israel, Poland, Mexico, Egypt, and Turkey. And some signs of declining dollarization are evident in Latin American countries where it seemed that dollarization was impossible to reverse. Could legal restrictions on dollarization speed up the process of dedollarization? Effectively implemented, they could. But that route should not be tried until the preconditions for macroeconomic stability are in place. And the restrictions are likely to be difficult to enforce. This may be especially the case for unit of account dollarization, where people are likely to find ways to contract in their preferred units despite the law. Over the longer run, once normal conditions have been restored, it should be possible to permit more freedom to individuals and institutions to operate in the financial assets and liabilities that they prefer. Just as in the case of price level indexation, when the macroeconomic environment has been stabilized, indexed and foreign currency instruments can be introduced without destabilizing the macroeconomy. IV.  Euroization and EMU If dollarization, including full dollarization, should be avoided, why join EMU? This is a question which Turkey will have to ask itself, sooner one hopes, rather than later. The answer is that joining EMU is a more far-reaching step than implementing a currency board, or even deciding to use a foreign currency. For membership in EMU involves signing up to a host of restrictions on policy, not least on fiscal policy, which are designed to prevent the types of crisis that make full dollarization potentially problematic. Further, membership in the EU facilitates some of the adjustment mechanisms – including totally free trade, full capital mobility, and considerable labor mobility5 – that are frequently absent when a country dollarizes unilaterally. And EMU members do have a say in determining monetary policy. There still remains the fundamental fact that a country that joins EMU gives up the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism. Countries that have more flexible wages and prices will adjust better than                                                       5  The extent of labor mobility will be a major issue when Turkey joins the EU, as it is in the cases of Bulgaria and Romania. BIS Review 126/2006 5 
those with less flexibility, and on present performance Turkey is likely to have an advantage in that regard. To set these problems in perspective, we need to remember that the states of the United States also gave up the exchange rate as an adjustment mechanism, and that they manage to adjust to shocks quite well. But at this point we are discussing the topic for the next Central Bank of Turkey conference – how to make the best of the benefits of joining the EU and EMU – and I would like to conclude by thanking our hosts for their invitation and for their hospitality, and by wishing Turkey every success as it continues its impressive economic development. Thank you. 6 BIS Review 126/2006 
Savenaca Narube: Brief look at the commercial banking sector in Fiji Opening address by Mr Savenaca Narube, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, at the official opening of Bank of South Pacific Limited, Suva, 18 December 2006. *      *      * Your Excellency, Mr. Peter Eafeare Mr. Noreo Beangke, Chairman Bank of South Pacific Mr. Garth Mcllwain, Managing Director Bank of South Pacific Mr. Kevin McCarthy, General Manager, Papua New Guinea Mr. Greg Watson, General Manager, Fiji Mr. Irfan Rabbani, Habib Bank Limited Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen: I am glad to be here this morning and thank you for the invitation to the official opening of the Bank of South Pacific branch in Fiji. It is always pleasing to see a new bank join the financial sector in Fiji. Over the years we have seen several banks come and go. This of course is a commercial reality. I am particularly glad that the new entrant that we are welcoming today is a strong regional bank. It is also encouraging that, in our current political climate, the Bank of South Pacific has decided to go ahead with its plans to enter Fiji. I warmly congratulate you on this new venture and wish Bank of South Pacific Limited all the best in your operations in Fiji. Fiji is going through some turbulent times. We in the Reserve Bank of Fiji have moved quickly to safeguard financial stability. We have asked the commercial banks to freeze their loan books. We have tightened exchange controls. But let me explain here that we have not stopped any foreign transactions. We have just asked the commercial banks that they seek our approval first before they make these deals. I must thank the commercial banks for their support and cooperation for the measures that we have put in place. Bank of South Pacific Limited has a long history of banking in Papua New Guinea going back as far as 1957. BSP is listed on the Port Moresby Stock Exchange and has 54 percent market share of the total assets of the Papua New Guinea banking system making it the largest bank in the country. It operates a network of 39 branches across Papua New Guinea and one branch in Niue. BSP is increasing its overseas presence – here in Fiji today and in the Solomon Islands. BSP has satisfied all the licensing requirements of the Reserve Bank of Fiji and we are pleased to issue the Bank with a licence. With the commencement of Bank of South Pacific Limited’s operations today, we envisage many benefits to both countries. Trade relationships between Papua New Guinea and Fiji will be strengthened. We will see increased competition for banking services and products. There will also be an opportunity for capacity building as Fiji staff work in other BSP branches and vice versa. We at the Reserve Bank of Fiji look forward to working closely with Bank of South Pacific Limited to ensure that Fiji’s financial system is dynamic and sound. I look forward to your contribution to the economy and the financial system. Once again, I congratulate you on the official opening of Bank of South Pacific Limited and wish you every success in your operations. Thank you. BIS Review 126/2006 1 
Mario Draghi: Education and economic growth Lectio Magistralis by Mr Mario Draghi, Governor of the Bank of Italy, at the inauguration of the 100th academic year, University of Rome “La Sapienza”, Economic Faculty, Rome, 9 November 2006. *      *      * 1. Education and development Italy set out on a path of rapid development after the Second World War and kept on it for more than a quarter-century. A substantial part of the country’s disadvantage with respect to those with higher levels of economic welfare was made good. Although it was marked by sometimes acute social tensions and distributive conflicts, growth benefited from several domestic and external factors that made for extremely large productivity gains. Increasing resources, which had been largely underutilized in the agricultural sector, were employed in the sectors with higher output per worker, completing the transition to an industrial economy. This unprecedented rapid and sustained growth was accompanied by a progressive rise in the educational level of the population that fitted nicely with the state of technological knowledge. Since the 1990s the inrush of the emerging economies on the international markets and the advent of the new information and communications technologies, biotechnologies and thin material technologies have radically altered the characteristics of global economic development. They have created new hierarchies, revolutionized production processes and, especially in the advanced countries, thoroughly modified the characteristics of the labour input demanded by firms. The ample strand of economic literature that investigates the connection between education and development has gained new vigour. Broadly speaking, the level of education carries decisive weight in explaining processes of economic growth from two fundamental angles. One concerns the improvement of knowledge applied to production: human capital formation fuels efficiency in production and drives up the remuneration of labour and the other factors of production. This engine of growth becomes still more important in phases characterized by rapid technical progress. In the 1960s Edmund Phelps observed that the acquisition of advanced knowledge was an essential condition for innovation and for adapting to new technologies. The endowment of human capital assumes a crucial value that transcends those who benefit from it in the first instance: it promotes the generation and diffusion of new ideas that impart impetus to technical progress; it improves earnings prospects and, closing the virtuous circle, increases the incentive for further investment in human capital. As a primary source of accumulation of this type of capital, the educational system produces major externalities that help raise the growth prospects of the entire economy. This is one of the most interesting insights of the “new” theories of endogenous growth. According to some estimates, the social returns to education are higher than the private returns; that is, they exceed the extra benefits enjoyed by the individual who has more and better education. But the externalities - and we come here to the second angle - are not limited to the sphere of production in the narrow sense; they also affect the social context and contribute to economic growth in this way as well. This aspect has been analyzed mainly in connection with the developing countries, but of course it applies to the advanced societies too. For some time economic thought - and not it alone - has underscored that the properties of efficiency of the markets in an economy cannot be considered ignoring “social capital”, defined as the body of institutions, social norms and trust and reciprocity in formal and informal networks of relations that foster collective action and are a resource for creating welfare. At aggregate level social capital, as distinct from human capital, with which it is nevertheless connected, is a factor of human, social and economic development. It is a system of shared values that guarantees the sense of responsibility for the commitments entered into by the parties in concluding a contract. These values constitute a trait of the national identity that is set in the long run through custom and principles handed down from generation to generation. The educational system can enrich this inheritance, enhancing opportunities and attenuating negative aspects. Social capital is an especially important factor for the development of the financial markets: the relationship of reciprocal trust between borrowers and creditors underpins the stability and correctness of business activity. The lack of it is, among other things, a barrier to the market entry of newly created BIS Review 125/2006 1 
firms. A high degree of schooling facilitates critical access to useful information for evaluating the advisability and risk of a financial contract; this results in lower costs for learning about and managing an investment and a greater incentive to participate in the financial markets. Education helps to relax the economic and cultural constraints that bind individuals to their environment of origin. It increases the probability that the most capable and deserving will rise to functions of command in the organization of productive factors. In this way too it exerts a positive influence on economic growth: good education boosts the efficiency of firms, creates the conditions for the competitive selection of the most innovative entrepreneurs - those most apt to drive economic growth - to unfold without being fettered by rights of caste and positions of rent. The thrust of these remarks on the link between education and development can also extend to demographic aspects. All else being equal, the diffusion of high levels of education is associated with better conditions of health and an increase in life expectancy, since it can lead to less risky behaviour and a greater ability to assimilate and act on information serving to prevent illness and gain access to available therapies. 2.  Education and the Italian economy’s potential for growth Since the mid-1990s, the annual increase in labour productivity in Italy has been one percentage point less than the average for the OECD countries. This is the underlying cause of the present crisis affecting the country’s growth and competitiveness. The rapid rise in employment fostered in recent years by wage moderation, the regularization of many immigrant workers and labour market reforms has produced a natural, and expected, slowdown in the rate of productivity growth. On top of this, however, the overall efficiency of the economy has deteriorated, as evidenced by the recent decline in total factor productivity, the only instance in the industrialized world. The situation is rendered even more worrying by the demographic scenario for the next decades. According to current projections, and despite taking account of large migratory flows, the working-age population is set to decrease dramatically, and this will act as a further brake on the potential growth of the Italian economy. Only a substantial increase in labour market participation and a return to productivity growth can reverse these trends. Raising the population’s average level of education and improving its quality are prerequisites for the achievement of both objectives. Although significant progress has been made in the past decade, the labour market participation rate in Italy is still well below the European average, particularly among women, young people and the older age groups. A higher level of education tends to narrow these gaps. In the OECD countries, the average rate of employment for university-educated men aged 25 to 64 is 15 percentage points higher than that of their peers with only a lower-secondary-school qualification; for women, the difference is 30 points. The fact that people with higher levels of education are more likely to be in work reflects their increased propensity to participate in the labour market and, in the case of adults, the smaller risk of unemployment. The Bank of Italy’s Economic Research Department estimates that, all other things being equal, in Italy the probability of participating in the labour market increases by 2.4 percentage points with every year of school attendance. In the South, the figure rises to 3.2 points, reflecting a greater relative scarcity of skilled workers. All this highlights the important contribution towards overcoming the country’s geographical dualism that could be made by policies to raise educational levels in the South. A high level of education is also the best way to minimize the risks of fragmented career paths and of job loss, which have become more pressing than in the past with the spread of fixed-term employment contracts. The higher the professional qualification, the greater the incentive for firms to invest in stable and lasting employment and the greater the likelihood of workers finding another job quickly if the present one is unsatisfactory or threatened by adverse events. Higher levels of education bring gains in productivity. The relationship can be gauged roughly from the link between educational qualification and earnings, that is from the personal return on education. In the majority of OECD countries, people with a qualification equivalent to our specialist university degree earn at least 50 per cent more than workers with a secondary school diploma. The wage differentials between workers with a diploma and workers with only a lower secondary school certificate range from 15 to 30 per cent. In Italy individuals’ return on education is lower than the OECD average; nonetheless, the return on a given investment in education, even taking the associated costs fully into account, is much higher than for alternative investments. 2 BIS Review 125/2006 
A poor level of education can affect the evolution of productivity through the inability to exploit the opportunities offered by rapid technical progress. It is only recently, and later in Italy than elsewhere, that the organization of production has begun to benefit from extensive use of information technology, for which better training is essential. Among the highly developed countries, Italy stands out for its anomalous and static model of specialization, in which the predominant industries are marked by a medium to low level of human-capital. It is a model that is consistent with a relatively small endowment of highly skilled manpower. In the new technological and competitive environment it drags our economy down, preventing it from penetrating today’s more dynamic innovative branches and exposing it to the fiercer competition from emerging countries. Another crucial condition for overcoming this static model is the presence of managerial skills capable of reshaping production processes, exploiting technologies, and reallocating resources. The widespread availability of these skills can be achieved through higher levels of education; inevitably this will be accompanied by greater contestability of firms’ ownership. 3.  What kind of education? In the course of the twentieth century Italy’s schools and universities sustained the nation’s economic growth and civil progress. They became less elite and progressively opened themselves to the society at large. Giving an education to millions of previously excluded citizens reduced inequalities but at the same time made it more difficult to attain high standards of achievement. Over the decades, national school and university reform measures responded only partially to the emerging need to bring a growing student population up to higher levels of education, all the more essential today given the transformation of the labour market in the advanced countries. The education deficit remains worrisome, because of Italy’s lateness in commencing mass education and its more unfavourable demographic dynamics. Notwithstanding significant gains in young people’s level of educational attainment, in 2005 only 37.5 per cent of Italians aged 25 to 64 had upper secondary diplomas, nearly 8 percentage points below the OECD average. And the gap in the share of university graduates was wider still: scarcely 12 per cent in Italy, half the OECD average. Because of the faster aging of the Italian population, the share of young people is one of the lowest anywhere in the world. The consequence is that the gains made by the younger generations have only limited impact on the average level of educational attainment. Too many adolescents still abandon their studies, and those who stay in school have a harder time learning than their peers in the rest of Europe. In 2004 only 76 out of every 100 young people of graduation age got their upper secondary diplomas, one of the lowest percentages among the advanced countries. The OECD’s periodic surveys have found that at the end of compulsory schooling Italian youngsters rank near the bottom in mathematical achievement, having fallen about a year behind students elsewhere. Perhaps this should come as no surprise, considering the decline in the number of mathematics and physics students in universities. Nor do the results in other disciplines provide much consolation. The share of Italian students whose reading comprehension is inadequate is significantly higher than the European average. These unsatisfactory average results are compounded by significant regional disparities, to the disadvantage of students in the South of Italy, and by great variability from school to school. The dispersion of the achievement test results for 15-year-olds is among the highest in the OECD countries. Even in the context of an overwhelmingly public school system, the level of education and income of the student’s family remain decisive. If the quality of schools is differentiated and informational transparency is lacking, only “educated” parents will be able to guide their children to the best classes and the most capable teachers. Our problems do not stem from a shortage of public resources allocated to the school system. Indeed, Italy’s spending on primary and secondary education is higher per student than the OECD average, not because of higher teacher salaries but due to higher teacher/student ratios. Italy has 9.4 teachers for every 100 students in secondary schools and 9.2 in elementary schools, against OECD averages of 7.4 and 6.1 and European averages of 8.5 and 6.8. The higher ratio in Italy depends in part on social policy choices, such as the widespread use of tutors for special students and the local provision of educational services in small and geographically scattered communities. Even taking these factors into account, however, the disparity with the other countries remains substantial, reflecting among BIS Review 125/2006 3 
other things the fragmentation of the subjects studied, and the difference does not translate into better academic results. Organizational shortcomings and poor motivation of staff are significant factors. The magnitude of the effect that is produced on economic growth by an increase in the average educational level varies with the type of instruction that is promoted. The most effective are those that enhance the occupational mobility of workers and, above all, the spread of new ideas. In the United States the broader diffusion of basic knowledge has fit well with the acceleration in technical progress, helping to increase America’s lead in growth over the countries of continental Europe. Technical and vocational schools with highly specialized courses have long-established roots, notably in Germany, where they have sustained economic and social development since the turn of the twentieth century. They arose in an age in which the definition of skills was much more narrowly circumscribed and more stable than it is now, based as it was on relatively fixed working procedures and standards of knowledge. Today there is a widely perceived need for an extensive revision of the mission of these schools, because there is a greater need for knowledge that can adapt to technological contexts whose boundaries are a good deal less well defined and constantly shifting. Without denying the important role that technical and vocational schools still play in our economic system, schooling could be oriented more to the learning of general skills and aptitudes, which also encourage students to proceed to higher levels of education. This leads us to a brief discussion of universities. In Italy the proportion of people aged between 25 and 34 who have a university degree is still below the average for the main industrial countries, despite the significant increase in recent years following the university reform of 2002. The university drop-out rate is 60 per cent, nearly twice the average for the leading countries. The proportion of graduates who go on to earn a postgraduate qualification is very small, so that Italy is fourth from the bottom in the ranking of OECD countries. The bulk of the recent increase in the number of graduates has consisted of students doing a shorter course. In the last two years matriculants have converged above all on law and the political and social sciences. More generally, by international standards the study courses of Italian university students appear biased towards the humanities and social sciences and away from technical and scientific subjects. Part of the difference is due to the fact that, in contrast with Italy, shorter-course university degrees in other countries are mainly in technical subjects. But another part of the explanation is to be found in the high rents enjoyed by some professions, which distort families’ choices, and in firms’ insufficient demand for high technical and scientific qualifications. Fewer public resources are allocated to higher education in Italy than in many other advanced countries. This is the flip side of the larger volume of resources allocated to primary and secondary education. The basic political choice was to privilege early education to the detriment of investment in advanced knowledge. This is not a far-sighted choice in a world in which innovation is the key to growth. The public resources allocated to higher education in Italy appear even smaller when compared with those made available to Anglo-Saxon university systems, despite their having a great many private institutions. The manner of intervening is different, however: in the United States, for example, it is mainly in the form of direct financing of deserving students and their families through scholarships and personal loans; in Italy, as in the rest of continental Europe, the bulk of funds serve to finance the universities. 4.  Looking ahead By now nobody in Italy should have any doubts about the urgent need to revive economic growth. The present lively cyclical upturn is certainly not sufficient to trigger a rapid solution to the structural defects of Italy’s productive system. For the reasons that I have tried to set out here, education is one of the most important aspects of a reform strategy aimed at altering the context in which that system operates. In a modern economy the public sector organizes and regulates the market, produces public goods and corrects externalities. In the case of education, these principles need to be applied taking account of the sector’s specific features and complexity. 4 BIS Review 125/2006 
An effective education policy must reconcile excellence with a fair distribution of the opportunities to go on learning up to the desired level. These two objectives are not in conflict, provided the public sphere seeks to create equal opportunities and chooses operational options that allow the market to play a part in selecting excellence. Scholastic success depends significantly on the conditions of pupils’ families. From this point of view Italy appears to be socially almost immobile. The probability of earning a degree depends on the quality of the preceding education, but if this is sometimes inadequate, as in Italy today, the family’s socio-economic background plays a major role. Too little has changed in this respect since Don Milani raised the same question forty years ago, albeit in another context, in the light of his experience with the children of the school at Barbiana. Giving all young people the same opportunity to succeed in learning, provided they apply themselves, is the key to increasing efficiency and fairness in the field of education. Both these objectives can be pursued in a variety of complementary ways. In primary and secondary education it may be worth increasing the competition between schools, both public and private, through methods of financing that both reward the best schools and transfer resources directly to families in order to give them more choice. The information that guides families in their choice of schools appears insufficient. In addition to the prospect of obtaining a diploma that has the same value for everybody, they should be offered uniform assessment criteria that permit informed choices. It is necessary to eliminate the perverse incentive for families and schools to collude in lowering teaching standards, especially if financing continues to depend exclusively on the number of students enrolled. The first steps towards developing a comprehensive assessment system that have already been incorporated in Italian legislation deserve to be followed by others, not least so as to permit better informed guidance of public action to govern and reform the school system. Somewhat similar considerations apply to universities, essential institutions for an economy that wishes to retain its place among the advanced countries. In recent years important changes have been made to the Italian university system. For the first time an assessment has been made of the quality of research. Notwithstanding all the measurement problems involved, this could shortly be used to guide the public financing of individual universities. It is important that the work done should not turn into a missed opportunity. Transparency and public access to the assessment process help to improve the comparison between universities and permit better informed choices by students, especially those with less access to the channels providing a greater wealth of information. It is to be hoped that this will be the first of a series of measures to stimulate competition among universities, by increasing the incentives to raise standards in research and instruction and in the selection of university teachers. In schools and in higher education, more explicit recognition of merit avoids the mortification of the most talented, provided it is accompanied by measures to support deserving poor students. The recognition of merit is not a guarantee of equity but its absence undoubtedly means society is less fair because it accentuates the discrimination caused by differences in starting conditions; at the same time society is poorer because it wastes its resources. I am convinced we will succeed in renewing the unity of intent that alone can bring an advance in Italian education, the unity that has provided the foundation for the development of the educational system since the Second World War.

Hamad Al-Sayari: The “Banker” program in Saudi Arabia  Speech by His Excellency Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, in the Inauguration Ceremony of The "Banker" Program, at the Institute of Banking, Riyadh, 28 November 2006. *      *      * Dear Brothers, I am pleased to welcome you all on this occasion in which we celebrate reaping another fruit of the joint cooperation between the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency and the banks operating in the Kingdom, namely, the "Banker" program. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the participating banks and the Institute of Banking for their support and efforts for organizing and executing this ambitious program which aims at meeting the growing needs of the banking sector and qualifying job-seekers of the Saudi youth.  As you know, the banking sector has witnessed over the past few years accelerated developments due to the economic growth seen by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. These developments have posed a great challenge to the banks and financial institutions as they had to expedite the provision and diversification of financial services to meet the increasing needs of the domestic market.  The development of financial institutions must, undoubtedly, be paralleled with development in human resources. This, in turn, requires plans for training and qualifying cadres to enable financial institutions to undertake their important role in serving the national economy.  Since its inception, SAMA has supported banks to develop human resources by establishing the Institute of Banking, which contributes to training and qualifying a large number of national cadres in the financial services sector. The Institute continues to professionally exercise this role and make efforts to cope with the developments in the financial and banking sector by providing information solutions and diverse educational programs consistent with individual bank needs.  The Institute's programs have covered important banking fields, such as treasury, investment and credit, and contributed effectively to developing and qualifying national cadres. Thus, Saudization in the banking sector exceeded 85 percent by the end of the first half of 2006. Dear Audience, These developments, which have diversified and expanded the services provided in the Saudi market, have given rise to substantial challenges to financial institutions. One of the most important challenges is to provide a sufficient number of qualified human resources to meet the needs of these institutions. Despite the employment efforts made by banks to cope with this expansion, and though 4,246 employees were appointed during the first half of 2006, the total needs of these institutions are still not satisfied. Hence, SAMA has promptly exerted expeditious efforts in search for solutions to these challenges. To this end, it has instructed the Institute of Banking to study the situation and propose practical solutions to help banks bridge such gap over both the short and long terms. The "Banker" program comes as a solution complementary to the study programs arranged by educational institutions, and a parallel to the banks' direct efforts in attracting and employing national cadres. We are gathering here today to celebrate the opening of the first course of this integrated program, which hopefully will provide the financial institutions with needed human resources, and offer good job opportunities for the youth of our homeland. In conclusion, I can only reiterate my thanks to all those who contributed to accomplishing the "Banker" program, which I hope will continue to successfully achieve the objectives for which it has been established.  Thank you for listening.  BIS Review 125/2006 1 
Caleb M Fundanga: The Bank of Zambia’s management development programme for managers Remarks by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the opening of the Management Development Programme for Managers, Livingstone, 4-15 December 2006. *      *      * • Director – Human Resources • Assistant Director – Organisation Development • The Consultants • Participants • Ladies and Gentlemen I welcome you all to this Management Development Programme. Management development programmes are crucial not only to Staff development but also to the realisation of the Bank of Zambia vision. As you are aware, our vision is “To be a world class central bank”. Our vision can only be realised if the performance of our employees measures up to world class standards, because it is employees who make an institution what it is. In other words, we can not have a world class central bank without world class employees. Ladies and Gentlemen: I would like to refer you to our strategic plan document. You will note that in its values statement, the Bank states that employees of the Bank of Zambia shall at all times endeavor to direct their efforts towards the achievement of the mission of the Bank by consistently following the values encapsulated in the BoZ Way. You will also note that the Bank has, in turn, undertaken to support employees by, inter-alia, continuously enhancing the capacity of the Bank through the development of all staff. This reflects the realisation by the Bank that without world-class employees, its aspiration to be a world class central bank as stated in its vision statement cannot be attained. For the Bank therefore, this programme is important because it is a step taken towards enhancing the skills of our staff to world class standards and is a commitment to attaining our vision. The programme you have come to participate in is unique in two respects. First, this programme is tailor-made or specifically designed for Bank of Zambia staff. Second, it focuses on middle management which is a reflection of the importance that the Bank places on the role that its middle managers play in helping it achieve its vision and mission. The programme has been designed to impart general management knowledge and skills to you our middle managers which will enhance your leadership and managerial abilities. The programme is designed to provide you with the tools that will enable you to contribute effectively towards the management of the Bank and also to prepare you for succession as and when opportunities arise. The first module you will learn is on the Functions of the Board of the Bank of Zambia. This was included to provide you with an understanding of the relevance of the Board to our strategic plan management process and ultimately to your job. Second, you will have a module on good corporate governance. Without wishing to preempt what you shall be taught, I wish to only explain that good corporate governance is one of our strategic objectives and its inclusion as a strategic objective reflects our commitment to align our operations with world best practices, consistent with our vision ‘to be a world class central bank’. The module on Risk Management was included to provide you with knowledge that will enable you appreciate why the Bank has introduced the Risk Management Department. Director - Risk Management will do a presentation during which he will explain what risk management is all about and its relevance to Bank of Zambia. Finally, the inclusion of a module on the Core Functions of the Bank of Zambia is designed to provide you with knowledge on the operations for which the Bank was established. This is important for a number of reasons. First, we want to have a cadre of enlightened and well informed managers who will portray a positive image of the Bank and reflect our standing as a world-class Bank. As managers, you have to have a reasonable understanding of how the Bank’s core activities departments operate and are organised. Second, as managers, especially as “world-class” employees, you are also expected, by the public, to BIS Review 125/2006 1 
have a reasonable grasp of issues pertaining to core operations of the Bank. This may sound pretty obvious, but I know that there are many of our managers who have no idea how some of our core departments function and cannot intelligently explain our role in the economy. This reflects badly on the Bank with regard to the calibre of its staff. The third point is that your understanding of core and other departments operations for that matter will facilitate staff rotation, a policy to which the Bank is commited. Finally, and most importantly, an understanding of core functions enables you to better understand and appreciate the mission of the Bank. This in turn facilitates a better understanding of the strategic plan. In closing, I wish to say that I know that the Bank has come a long way and has demonstrated marked improvements in the way that it conducts its operations and in the quality of its management. Director – Human Resources will show in his presentation on the change process in the Bank. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 125/2006 
Ben S Bernanke: The Chinese economy – progress and challenges  Remarks by Mr Ben S Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing, 15 December 2006.  *      *      * The emergence of China as a global economic power is one of the most important developments of recent decades. For the past twenty years, the Chinese economy has achieved a growth rate averaging nearly 10 percent per year, resulting in a quintupling of output per person. In overall size, China's economy today ranks as the fourth largest in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) at current exchange rates and the second largest when adjustments are made for the differences in the domestic purchasing power of national currencies. This strong economic performance has resulted in improved living standards for the Chinese people. By some estimates, about 200 million Chinese have been brought out of poverty since the reforms began in 1978.1 Moreover, by 2004 life expectancy at birth in China had reached seventy-one years, the infant mortality rate had fallen to 26 per 1,000 live births, and the literacy rate of those aged fifteen or above had reached 90 percent.2 These are remarkable accomplishments. Nonetheless, by most measures China remains a developing nation.3 In particular, although life in some urban centers is typical of a modern, affluent society, average household incomes and consumption remain quite low in rural and inland areas. Thus, China faces the double challenge of sustaining a high and stable overall rate of economic growth while stimulating economic development in parts of the country that have shared less fully in the economic boom. In my remarks today, I would like to offer a few thoughts on how China can continue to prosper and promote the economic welfare of its people. Economic progress: markets and productivity Economists agree that the most important determinant of living standards in a country is the average level of productivity, or output per worker. On this score as well, China's record in recent decades is excellent. Between 1978, when the Open Door policy reforms began, and 1989, output per employed person in China grew vigorously, at an estimated average rate of about 6-1/2 percent per year. However, from 1990 to 2005, productivity grew at an even more impressive rate of 9 percent per year.4  Many factors have contributed to this strong productivity performance, including high rates of capital investment, increasing openness to trade, and a strengthening of the educational system.5 However, in my view, the single most important cause of the ongoing expansion in productivity is that China has moved, gradually but steadily, away from central planning and toward a greater reliance on markets. In 1978, almost no prices in China were determined by the market, and most production was controlled or directed by the state. Since then, the government has reduced its direct intervention in the economy and scaled back state-owned enterprises, in the process allowing more scope for market forces. By 1999, according to one estimate, about 95 percent of retail business, together with more than 80 percent of trade in agricultural commodities and producer goods, was conducted at market-determined prices.6                                                        1  Bergsten and others ( 2006), p. 3. 2  World Bank (2006). 3  For example, according to 2005 data from the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook database, China's per capita GDP is about one-sixth of that of the United States on a purchasing-power-parity basis and about one twenty-fifth that of the United States at current exchange rates. 4  Productivity growth rates are calculated by Federal Reserve Board staff using Chinese data on output and employment. Productivity can be difficult to measure, and so these figures should be treated as approximate. A new method for surveying employment was introduced in 1990, resulting in a break in the series in that year. 5  See, for example, chapter 2 of Bergsten and others (2006) for a discussion of why China has grown so rapidly. 6  Lardy (2002), p. 25. BIS Review 124/2006 1 
Substantial experience has shown that modern economies, including those in early stages of development, are too complex to be managed effectively on a centralized basis. Prices set in free and competitive markets serve several critical functions, among them aggregating disparate information about supply and demand conditions and the relative scarcities of specific goods and services; directing resources to their most productive uses; and providing incentives to engage in cost reduction, innovation, and entrepreneurial activities.  A free market for labor is particularly critical for sustained economic development. China has made substantial progress in this area over the past few decades, most notably by reducing barriers to the movement of workers among regions, sectors, and firms and by allowing greater flexibility in the determination of employment and wages.7 Indeed, the ongoing movement of workers from relatively low-productivity, low-wage jobs in agriculture to higher-productivity, higher-wage jobs in manufacturing and services has been a significant source of Chinese economic growth. The decline in the share of the population in rural areas, from more than 80 percent in 1970 to less than 60 percent in 2005, indicates the scale of the movement of labor out of agriculture in recent decades. Despite these shifts, differences in labor productivity among sectors remain large. For example, in 2005, estimated output per worker in agriculture and related sectors was about $800, whereas in industries such as manufacturing, utilities, and mining, output per worker was about $5,900, more than seven times as much.8 Moreover, a considerable portion of China's labor force (specifically, in agriculture and in inefficient state-owned enterprises) remains underutilized. Thus, substantial additional gains in productivity for the economy as a whole might be realized through the further reallocation of the labor force to more productive and growing sectors. In particular, small- and medium-sized enterprises are emerging as an engine of job creation in China - as they are in the United States - even as they promote innovation and help to create a more dynamic and diversified economy. The government can support the process of reallocating labor to more productive uses by continuing to reduce barriers to labor mobility, helping workers obtain the education and training they need to be productive in new occupations, and encouraging entrepreneurship and small-business development. As significant as the reallocation of labor among sectors has been, more of the improvement in productivity in recent years has resulted from increasing efficiencies within the major sectors rather than from the reallocation of resources between sectors. Here again, markets and competition have played a vital role. In particular, the opening of the economy to international trade and investment, which has accelerated since China's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2001, has done much to harness market forces in the service of the country's development. Exposure to the competition of the global marketplace has forced Chinese producers - alone or in partnership with foreign firms - to increase their efficiency and improve the quality of their output. Notably, globally-engaged firms (or their affiliates) operating in China have helped to foster productivity growth in the country by introducing new technologies and managerial techniques, as well as by enhancing domestic competition. Although the expansion of the market-based portion of the economy has yielded impressive results, further gains could be achieved by allowing still greater scope for market forces. The energy sector presents one such opportunity. As you know, China's appetite for energy has grown rapidly: China's consumption of oil has risen by more than 50 percent since 2000, and the International Energy Agency estimates that Chinese oil usage has increased by about 400,000 barrels per day in 2006, representing nearly half of this year's growth in world oil demand. This rapid expansion in energy use reflects both overall economic growth and a relatively energy-intensive pattern of development. Greater use of market pricing in the energy sector, including the elimination of remaining price controls on fuels and the liberalization of electricity prices, would support cleaner, sustainable economic growth by promoting more-efficient use of energy by households and firms and by encouraging the development of new energy supplies.9                                                       7  Brooks (2004) provides details of some of the labor market developments in China in recent years.  8  Calculations use current exchange rates and are based on output and employment data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and the Chinese State Statistical Office; most data from Chinese national sources are obtained from the CEIC database. 9  The adverse effects on poor households of eliminating price controls on fuels would best be dealt with through direct cash grants. 2 BIS Review 124/2006 
Significant benefits could also be obtained by allowing a larger role for market forces in guiding investment decisions. China's economic growth owes much to the extraordinary share of GDP that is devoted to investment in new capital, such as factories, equipment, and office buildings, which is partly financed by a very large amount of business saving.10 However, the rapid pace of investment growth raises concerns about whether new capital is being deployed in the most productive ways. In particular, some analysts have questioned whether China is getting an adequate return on its investment. For example, from 1990 to 2001, fixed investment as a share of GDP in China averaged about 33 percent, and the economy grew at an annual rate of 10 percent. Between 2001 and 2005, fixed investment's share of GDP rose to about 40 percent, but the economy's average growth rate remained about the same, suggesting a lower return to the more recent investment. Comparisons can also be drawn to the rapid development phases of other Asian countries, such as South Korea and Japan. Average annual growth was between 9 and 10 percent in South Korea during the 1982-91 period and in Japan during the 1955-70 period; but for both countries during the relevant years investment's share of GDP was about 30 percent, lower than it is in China today. In a few Chinese industries, heavy investments have continued even as signs of excess capacity have begun to appear - another possible indication of capital misallocation. An example is the steel industry, in which excess capacity appears to have tripled between 2002 and 2005 to reach more than 115 million metric tons.11 Allowing competitive financial markets to play a larger role in the allocation of capital would likely increase the returns to investment and reduce the risk that uneconomic investments could exacerbate the problem of nonperforming loans and contribute to future financial instability. Basing investment decisions on market signals also takes better account of the costs of inputs complementary to capital, such as labor (relatively abundant in China) and energy (relatively scarce).12  China has taken initial steps toward a greater reliance on markets for determining the allocation of investment - for example, by authorizing and beginning to liberalize the stock market. China has also strengthened its banking system by improving supervision, confronting the enormous problem of nonperforming loans, allowing domestic institutions to partner with foreign banks, and increasing the use of market-based criteria in bank lending. These trends are positive; however, a great deal more remains to be done, including broadening the range of financial instruments available to savers and borrowers; taking further steps to ensure that credit evaluation and extension are based on sound economic criteria; increasing competition in banking and finance; improving credit availability for consumers and smaller firms; removing the remaining controls on interest rates; and eliminating the use of quantitative and administrative measures to influence the amount and composition of capital investment. Finally, capital markets require an appropriate institutional foundation to function effectively: Well-defined property rights (including intellectual property rights), transparent accounting standards, good corporate governance, effective supervisory oversight of banks and markets, the consistent enforcement of contracts, and rules that allow for orderly bankruptcy proceedings for unprofitable firms all help to support efficient investment. China has made progress in developing these critical institutions, but continued focus on these areas would provide large economic benefits in the long run. Macroeconomic policy Moving from microeconomics to macroeconomics, I believe that China could benefit by improving its tools for managing the economy - notably, monetary and fiscal policies. Effective use of macroeconomic policy tools can help achieve low and stable inflation and increase economic stability by moderating the effects on growth of temporary fluctuations in global or domestic demand. Stable economic conditions reduce an important source of risk and consequently promote innovation and growth. As a central banker, I will focus my remarks on the development of monetary policy.13                                                        10  World Bank researchers have concluded that business saving now finances the majority of business investment in China (Kuijs, 2005). Some have questioned this (Shan, 2006). For a discussion of the issues involved in the debate, see Hoffman and Kuijs (2006). 11  Based on production and capacity data provided by the National Bureau of Statistics. 12  Market-based allocations of capital do not take into account environmental and other external effects, unless additional mechanisms such as tradable pollution permits are employed. 13  Goodfriend and Prasad (2006) provides a good description of the banking and financial systems of China and of issues regarding the implementation of monetary policy. BIS Review 124/2006 3 
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank, is capable and well-respected around the world. However, monetary policy can work well only to the extent that financial markets are sufficiently developed to allow the monetary authorities' interest-rate decisions to affect economic activity in a reasonably predictable way. The development of a reliable "monetary transmission mechanism" is thus another reason to reform and strengthen China's banks and financial markets. The more interest-sensitive that borrowing and investment decisions are, the more monetary policy can affect investment and aggregate demand without the need for quantitative controls. Moreover, when funds are allocated on market principles, only those projects with an expected risk-adjusted return that is higher than the relevant market rate of interest will be undertaken. Thus, for example, if the central bank raises interest rates, the market will ensure that the resulting slowing of investment will be borne by the least promising projects, without the need for officials to make such judgments. The effectiveness of monetary policy would also be enhanced by greater flexibility in the exchange rate. To maintain the current close link of the renminbi (RMB) to the dollar in the presence of capital inflows (arising from China's trade surplus or from foreign purchases of RMB-denominated assets), the PBOC must intervene in the exchange market to buy dollars with RMB. Increases in the domestic money supply will result unless the central bank offsets the effects of these purchases on the money supply by selling bonds to investors, primarily commercial banks, in exchange for RMB - a procedure commonly referred to as "sterilization." If dollar purchases by the central bank were not routinely sterilized, the money supply might increase more than desired, possibly leading to an overheating of the economy and inflation.  To date the PBOC has been largely successful in its sterilization operations, but if it continues to use this strategy it will eventually encounter problems. If the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate are maintained near their current levels, the incentives for capital inflows - and thus the need for continued intervention and sterilization - will remain undiminished. Accordingly, the value of outstanding sterilization bonds will continue to grow rapidly. These bonds could substitute for other assets that might be held by banks and private investors, potentially interfering with the growth and development of private financial markets. Further, the perception that the RMB is undervalued (a point to which I will return) has fueled additional capital inflows, as investors expect to earn capital gains when the RMB ultimately appreciates. However, these speculative inflows only increase the need for exchange-market intervention and sterilization. In the longer term, the continued growth and modernization of the Chinese economy will require a substantial loosening of current restrictions on the flow of financial capital into and out of the country. However, if fluctuations in the value of the RMB remain limited within a narrow range, permitting substantial capital mobility would almost entirely eliminate the PBOC's capacity to use monetary policy to stabilize the domestic economy, as any excess of Chinese over dollar interest rates, for example, would trigger large capital inflows. Further appreciation of the RMB, combined with a wider trading band and with the ultimate goal of a market-determined exchange rate, would allow an effective and independent monetary policy and thereby help to enhance China's future growth and stability.  From an institutional perspective, China may find - as many countries have done - that granting greater autonomy to the central bank, by insulating it to a degree from short-term political concerns, increases its ability to ensure price stability and support stable growth. Of course, central banks must remain accountable to governments over the longer term. Trade, capital flows, and the transition to domestically-led growth A central component of China's development strategy has been its openness to trade and capital inflows. For example, the value of goods exports and imports currently equals about two-thirds of China's GDP, a high level for a country of China's geographic size. China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) has been particularly effective in stimulating trade: Since joining the WTO in 2001, China has seen the dollar value of its exports grow at an average rate of about 30 percent per year, compared with annual growth of about 12-1/2 percent over the five years before gaining WTO membership. China currently accounts for about 7-1/2 percent of world exports, up from 1-1/2 percent in 1985. About half of China's trade is so-called processing trade; that is, components and materials are imported (mostly from other Asian countries), processing or assembly is done in China, and the finished product is re-exported. Much economic research has shown that openness to trade promotes 4 BIS Review 124/2006 
growth.14 Trade supports growth not only through the classical principle of comparative advantage, but also through the effects of trade on the intensity of market competition, transfers of technology and knowledge, and other factors. China has also proved successful in attracting capital inflows, particularly foreign direct investment (FDI). The flow of FDI into China increased from about $2 billion in 1986 to $72 billion in 2005, making the country the third largest recipient of FDI in the world, after the United Kingdom and the United States.15 FDI benefits China's development by bringing with it new technologies, products, and business methods.16 The flow of foreign investments in Chinese securities has also increased significantly, reaching $22 billion in 2005. As you know, China today is running substantial trade and current account surpluses. These external surpluses are caused in part by China's remarkably high saving rate.17 Because China's national saving rate is even higher than its rate of domestic investment, the country has excess funds to lend in the global capital market; it follows from the balance-of-payments accounts that China's net lending abroad (or its acquisition of foreign assets) equals the country's current account surplus. A large portion of this lending finances foreigners' purchases of Chinese net exports (the trade surplus). High household saving and the corresponding low level of consumption in China contribute to the trade surplus by depressing the demand for imports and by forcing domestic firms to look abroad for markets.  Together with the large trade and current account deficits of the United States, the Chinese external surpluses are contributing to the current pattern of global imbalances, which many economists and policymakers have argued are unsustainable in the long run. The Chinese leadership has recognized the importance of encouraging imports and achieving greater balance in China's international trade, having recently included these objectives in the Five-Year Plan for 2006-2010. In my view, not only would China's achieving smaller external balances contribute to global financial stability, it would also be in China's economic interest. Although China's extensive participation in the global trading and financial systems has been invaluable for the country's development, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to improve living standards at home. Today, about half of China's GDP is devoted to investment and to producing net exports for the rest of the world, and thus only the remaining half is available for consumption, including government consumption. In particular, household consumption in China last year was only 38 percent of GDP, down from 45 percent in 2001. In comparison, household consumption was about 60 percent of GDP in India in 2004, according to the most recent available data. China's low share of consumption in GDP is, of course, the counterpart of its high national saving rate.  Policies aimed at increasing household consumption would clearly benefit the Chinese people, notably by improving standards of living and allowing the fruits of economic development to be shared more widely. Such policies, by reducing saving and increasing imports, would also serve to reduce China's current account and trade surpluses.18 Putting greater reliance on domestic demand rather than net exports to drive growth would also decrease China's vulnerability to fluctuations in global demand. How can China direct a greater share of its output to domestic consumption? Again, increased flexibility in the exchange rate could help. As the Chinese trade surplus has continued to widen, many analysts have concluded that the RMB is undervalued.19 Indeed, the situation has likely worsened recently; because of the RMB's link to the dollar, its trade-weighted effective real exchange rate has                                                       14  See, for example, Sachs and Warner (1995), Frankel and Romer (1999), and Wacziarg (2001). 15  In 2005, the United Kingdom surpassed both China and the United States as the largest recipient of FDI in the world. In 2004, China ranked second after the United States. 16  For a discussion of the relationship between FDI and economic growth in China, see Zebregs (2002). 17  China's national saving rate was 41 percent in 2003 and 47 percent in 2005, according to IMF figures. As of 2003, the latest date for which detailed data are available, households accounted for 42 percent of domestic saving, with firms (including state-owned enterprises) and government accounting for 36 percent and 22 percent of domestic saving, respectively (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2006). 18  See Lardy (2006), for example, for a careful discussion of the need for reorientation of Chinese growth toward consumption. 19  See, for example, Goldstein (2004) and Anderson (2006). Dunaway and others (2006) provide a useful analysis of the sensitivity of the Chinese equilibrium real exchange rate to alternative approaches and assumptions commonly used. BIS Review 124/2006 5 
fallen about 10 percent over the past five years.20 Allowing the RMB to strengthen would make imports of consumer goods (as well as capital goods) into China less expensive. Greater scope for market forces to determine the value of the RMB would also reduce an important distortion in the Chinese economy, namely, the effective subsidy that an undervalued currency provides for Chinese firms that focus on exporting rather than producing for the domestic market. A decrease in this effective subsidy would induce more firms to gear production toward the home market, benefiting domestic consumers and firms. Reducing the implicit subsidy to exports could increase long-term financial stability as well: If China invests too heavily in export industries whose economic viability depends on undervaluation of the exchange rate, a future appreciation of the RMB could lead to excess capacity in those industries, resulting in low returns and an increase in nonperforming loans.  Although more flexibility in the exchange rate would be helpful, the most direct and probably the most effective way to reduce the external surpluses and increase the welfare of Chinese households is to take measures to reduce domestic saving relative to domestic investment.21 Why is domestic saving so high at present? The high saving rate of households, even very poor households, likely reflects the relatively thin "social safety net" in China. For example, only about 14 percent of the population is covered by health insurance, and pension plans (which, in any case, replace only about 20 percent of pre-retirement earnings) apply to only about 16 percent of the economically active population.22 Combined expenditures by the central government and local governments on education, health, pensions and relief, and social security amount to only about 4 percent of GDP, lower than most other countries at similar income levels. In the absence of a stronger social safety net, Chinese households save at high rates to protect themselves against risks such as unexpected medical expenses and poverty in old age. A sustained program of expanding social services has the potential for reducing saving and raising living standards in China and, at the same time, moderating China's external surpluses. In particular, increased government spending on health, education, and other types of social services would raise both household consumption and government consumption, and thus reduce national saving. As one means of helping to fund the increase in social expenditures, state-owned enterprises could be required to pay larger dividends to the government, a measure which I understand to be currently under consideration. Financial reforms that increase the access of households to mortgages, private insurance, and other forms of consumer finance would also support higher rates of consumption.  As I have noted, the Chinese leadership has made reducing the trade and current account surpluses an important policy objective. Further, recognizing that achieving these goals would be greatly facilitated by increases in consumption and in the social safety net, the government has instituted or proposed various reductions in taxes and increases in social spending. The government has also announced an effort to raise living standards in rural and inland areas. Obviously, it is too early to judge the success of these initiatives. However, these efforts are constructive and deserving of support. Conclusion As I have discussed today, China has made remarkable economic progress since the reforms began in 1978. Greater use of markets, together with expanding trade and capital flows, has helped to increase growth in output and productivity, which in turn has increased living standards significantly. A still-greater reliance on markets, particularly for allocating capital investment, would contribute to a continuation of strong economic growth. Further development of macroeconomic policy tools would also support healthy growth by keeping inflation low and by increasing economic stability. China also faces some significant risks and imbalances. The principal risk arises from the likelihood that capital is not being allocated as efficiently as possible, the result of an undervalued exchange rate and of capital markets that, despite positive steps, remain distorted and underdeveloped. Misallocated capital will not pay the highest possible returns, leading potentially to slower growth and future financial stress.

transmission mechanism and by the relative inflexibility of the exchange rate, which inhibit the central bank's ability to keep inflation low and to stabilize the economy. The principal imbalance lies in the composition of Chinese GDP, which is heavily tilted toward investment and net exports and away from domestic consumption and government provision of social services. A better balance would improve the welfare of the Chinese people (by increasing consumption and social services) and would increase global financial stability (by reducing China's current account and trade surpluses). The Chinese government has undertaken to reduce this imbalance by taking measures to expand domestic demand, especially household consumption, and I hope that these efforts will be successful. China's development and its opening up to the global economy have also benefited the United States in many ways. China is now the second-largest source of U.S. imports; these imports boost U.S. real incomes by allowing U.S. households to purchase consumption goods and U.S. firms to purchase intermediate inputs at lower cost. China is also a growing market for investment and exports by U.S. firms. Since China joined the WTO, U.S. exports to China have more than doubled. As China develops further, its households and firms will demand a greater variety of goods and services, enhancing opportunities for producers in industrial countries, including the United States. At the same time, trade - with all its benefits - does displace some workers and firms as patterns of production and consumption change. The policy challenge for the United States is to help those who are adversely affected by trade while preserving the broad gains that openness to trade provides for the economy as a whole. The economic relationship between China and the United States is of extraordinary importance, and both countries have much to gain from interactions with each other. Serious challenges exist as well, requiring both countries to address such areas as energy, the environment, intellectual property rights, and global imbalances. Regarding global imbalances, I have discussed means by which China can reduce its contribution to the imbalances while encouraging domestic consumption. The United States must also do its part, in particular by increasing its own rate of national saving and by avoiding protectionism. With greater integration come greater interdependence and greater responsibility. I hope that our countries will work together in a spirit of cooperation to address these shared challenges.

BIS Review 124/2006 1 John Gieve: Pricing for perfection Speech by Sir John Gieve, Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, at the Bank of England, London, 14 December 2006. *      *      * Many of you will have seen the new Financial Stability Report (FSR) that we published in July. Our aim in that Report was to set out more concisely and clearly than in previous years what we considered the main risks to the stability of the UK’s financial system. The bottom line was that the financial system looked pretty resilient to disturbances in the near-term, but there were some underlying, longer term, vulnerabilities lurking in the background. Some related to potential mismatches or mis-pricing in international financial markets. Others to extended balance sheet positions at home and abroad. And some reflected structural dependencies across the financial system, for example, on the smooth functioning of financial infrastructure. Our view was that they were unlikely to cause problems in the near future but there was a non-negligible risk that they could crystallise rapidly and disruptively for the financial system. On past form we would be publishing the next Report this month but we have decided to change the publication schedule. Future FSRs will appear in the Spring and Autumn rather than Summer and Winter. So the 2007 editions are planned for late April and late October. But in case four months is too long to wait, I want to use my comments today to set out our assessment of prospects for financial stability as we near the end of 2006. Recent developments Our view remains that near-term risks to UK financial stability are low. That is mainly a reflection of the continuation of broadly benign macroeconomic conditions in the UK and globally A rebalancing in global sources of growth does appear to be under way - and we are watching developments in the US economy and movements in the US dollar closely – but overall the global economy remains strong. UK financial institutions profitability and capital levels have remained robust, providing them with a buffer against future disturbances. Financial markets have also demonstrated resilience over the past six months. Markets were turbulent at the time we were preparing the July FSR. It was unclear whether we were at the start of a significant correction. The subsequent rebound in asset prices, and declines in measures of volatility, showed that it was a pause not a sustained change in risk appetite. More recently, we have seen huge losses at the Amaranth hedge fund. These losses exceeded those of LTCM, yet markets facilitated a smooth wind down in positions. That is reassuring though some questions remain about the capacity of markets to handle such a disturbance if the macroeconomic backdrop and the balance sheets of major institutions were less rosy. The incident may also raise some questions about how effectively market forces are acting to restrain those taking outsized risk positions, something that I will return to in a moment. Taken together, these developments provide a strong baseline for financial stability. But the risks that we pointed to in July are still there. In particular, we pointed to the risk that financial firms concerned about losing market share in rapidly expanding markets might pay less attention than they should to their resilience to unexpected shocks. [Chart 1] gives our assessment of developments since July. It shows that a number of the vulnerabilities have edged up a little as leveraged buy-out (LBO) activity and commercial property lending have grown and as the number of personal insolvencies has increased. On the other hand, the slowdown in the US economy and the beginning of a narrowing in its trade balance may have reduced the risks on that side, although we didn’t judge this material enough to change our overall assessment. 
2 BIS Review 124/2006  We know how easy and how fruitless it can be to draw up long lists of things that could go wrong without paying attention to their likelihood. So we try to take a balanced view that recognises not just what could go wrong but also recognises changes that we think have a positive impact on financial stability. For example, I have been clear that, in the long run, the growth of derivative markets and the development of new players like hedge funds should help to price risks better and spread them more widely, and thus make the financial system more resilient. However, there is no denying that financial markets are liable to overshoot. And it is particularly important to stay alive to this risk when new records are being set for leveraged bids, returns on equity and City bonuses. Over-optimism in the financial system can have costs not just for the consenting counterparties but more broadly across the economy. By talking to you individually, drawing the threads together with our own analysis and feeding back a dispassionate but informed assessment of what your actions and plans add up to, we hope we can inform your decisions and thus help to head off instability. Low volatility One of the main vulnerabilities on our league table is low risk premia in financial markets – that is, the low level of compensation that investors are demanding to hold risk. In my remaining remarks I want to offer some observations on a closely related and interconnected topic: the low level of volatility in a number of asset classes. My colleague Paul Tucker has recently commented on low historic volatility. [Charts 2 to 4] show how the volatility of asset returns has come down for equities, bonds, and exchange rates to low levels by modern standards. One needs to go back to the Bretton Woods era to get volatility levels as low as at present.  
BIS Review 124/2006 3     
4 BIS Review 124/2006  Of course the reduction in the volatility of returns – and the lower compensation for future volatility embedded in risk premia – is responding to some real changes in the world. You might break down sources of uncertainty about future returns into three components: macroeconomic risks, financial risks and risks in the broader environment. Macroeconomic volatility has fallen considerably over the last decade in many economies [Chart 5]. In the real economy, greater flexibility in labour and product markets, especially openness to foreign competition through trade and immigration, has enabled smoother adjustment to shocks. On the price side, central bank independence and inflation targeting have contributed to greater price stability.  There is also greater depth and sophistication and fewer rigidities in financial markets. Innovation has created a variety of products enabling more and better risk transfer by financial market players and greater choice for end-investors. Greater financial market flexibility can support macroeconomic stability by keeping credit and liquidity available during periods of stress. But risks in the broader environment haven’t gone away. Threats from ecological or biological disasters, fraud, political conflict and terrorism seem as high as ever. And these are risks we have identified. As ever there may be some significant “unknown unknowns”. 
BIS Review 124/2006 5 So while there are some good reasons for the reduction in financial risk premia significant risks do remain. The question is how well are they priced? Are there any reasons for thinking that markets may be underpricing risk? I think there may be. Low risk premia and low volatility Sustained low economic and financial market volatility is bound to have implications for the level of compensation for risk that investors require in asset prices. In theory if assets become fundamentally less risky, then investors should receive a capital gain but should accept a lower future rate of return. If there have been signs of the capital gains, it is less clear that investors have revised down their expectations of rates of return on their portfolios. Indeed the pressure is to go beyond performing relatively well against your peers and to produce absolute returns. This has been fuelling a fierce search for yield and for ‘excess returns’ by asset managers who have to respond to this demand. Delivering on such a commitment in a world of low volatility takes impressive stock picking skills; buying or selling mis-priced assets and spotting emerging trends before the rest of the market. Clearly not everyone can beat the market. Some asset managers will be able to do so for a while either through luck or good judgement and their challenge is to keep ahead – often with the extra funds that their performance has attracted. Their competitors face added pressure to catch up. Both are bound to be tempted to take on greater risk to generate absolute returns. Of course this syndrome is widely recognised. Investment mandates and management remuneration are often measured against a risk-adjusted benchmark to avoid rewarding such activity. But it can take considerable efforts to spot such behaviour. The proliferation of new and highly complex financial instruments is making it harder to assess the incidence of underlying risk. The assumptions underlying the valuation of positions in such instruments are often unclear. Many of these products have the effect of selling insurance against unlikely financial market events. In so far as there has been a genuine increase in the stability of the economy and financial markets, selling volatility is less risky than it used to be. But it can be more risky than it appears. Our market contacts often cite the example of selling ‘out-of-the-money’ options as a popular strategy recently. Here the seller receives a steady stream of small payments today in return for paying up in the unlikely event that the price of an underlying instrument moves significantly from its current value. With sufficient leverage, a small payment stream can be turned into a tidy return. But as all insurers know, the key to long term return is to spread your risks widely or to avoid correlated risks. In assessing risk in financial markets, a common metric is correlation of positions with the market return. But this is quite inappropriate in this case. The value of a ‘deeply-out-of-the-money’ option has relatively low correlation with movements in the price of the underlying instrument or the market generally. So a simple measure of riskiness based on historical correlations will mistakenly show a leveraged out-of-the-money option trade as providing a good risk/return trade-off. In the jargon, selling volatility protection can be one way to generate ‘beta disguised as alpha’. One would usually expect that any mispricing of risk here would be counteracted by market forces. Countervailing strategies – buying volatility - should be profitable in the long run. The problem is that it requires patience, persistence and deep pockets. Going ‘long’ volatility means being prepared to make regular small payments and hoping to be compensated by a large irregular payoff. In a world of short run return targets, it is not surprising to find this is unpopular. If mispricing of this sort is underway it would show up in higher asset prices and lower implied volatilities across a range of markets. And implied volatilities are at or around historic lows in equity markets, bond markets, credit markets and foreign exchange markets [Chart 6-8] despite the market turbulence during May and June and recent rumblings on the dollar.

BIS Review 124/2006 7 Implications of low risk premia These low levels of implied volatility – and associated low level of risk premia – can have real implications for the economy and the stability of the financial system. In the corporate sector, for example, low risk premia may be one factor that has supported the rapid growth in private equity backed LBOs [Chart 9]. Spreads on high yield corporate debt have narrowed sharply in recent years, to the point where there seems very little compensation for credit risk, and almost none for liquidity risk [Chart 10]. A combination of squeezed corporate credit spreads and low reference risk-free government yields has resulted in the lowest nominal cost of borrowing for corporates since the 1950s.    In the July FSR we included a rough estimate that - other things equal - LBOs in 2004 and 2005 would raise the future probability of corporate default by 20 basis points. Given recent activity we now estimate it will add around 40 basis points over coming years relative to the current average probability 
8 BIS Review 124/2006 of corporate default of about 2.0%. Given the funds already raised by private equity firms, this might be expected to increase further in 2007. Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence that other corporates have increased leverage in defence – taking the view that it is imprudent to be ‘under-geared’ in an environment where private equity firms are flush with cash. Indeed, the CFO of one FTSE 250 company which geared up significantly to avoid being taken over remarked that “we have seen almost no drawbacks from being junk”. Another example of low implied volatilities and risk premia affecting risk taking occurs in cross border capital flows. In this case, low implied volatilities on interest rates and exchange rates can support cross-border carry trades because the yield pick up looks attractive when you can hedge the worst risks quite cheaply [Chart 11]. The continued smooth financing of global imbalances through these carry-trades in turn leads to low volatility. But this can of course work in reverse. Foreign exchange volatility has jumped up since the US Thanksgiving Day holiday. If this volatility were to persist the perceived risks in the carry trade would increase.  The common characteristic of these examples is that low implied volatilities reduce the apparent riskiness of portfolios and can encourage investors to take on more risk. And if implied volatilities are not a good measure of future volatility, they will end up bearing more risk than they expected. Avoiding this pitfall requires diligent risk assessment by investors and other counterparties. That is what is needed for market discipline to do its work. It requires both adequate disclosure of risk-relevant information and its effective use in investment decisions. In the case of the hedge fund sector, for example, it seems likely that greater institutional investor interest will continue to raise the bar on disclosure requirements, particularly for those generating returns using complex products where traditional measures like value-at-risk (VaR) may fail to capture fully the underlying risks. Conclusions To conclude, our overall assessment remains benign. The financial sector is strongly capitalised and well placed to handle even large shocks like Amaranth. The rapid pace of innovation in financial markets also promises better and wider distribution of risk which is good not just for the financial sector’s stability but should support more risk taking in the real economy. Greater investment could deliver stronger medium and long term growth. But there remain a number of sources of vulnerability in the world economy and in financial markets which firms need to bear in mind. Volatility is low, and as time passes longer memories are needed to remember when it was high. While there have certainly been improvements in macro performance in recent years, I do not know a central banker who is not surprised at the faith that markets appear to have in us to keep the great stability going. And the risks in the wider environment are as great as ever. 
BIS Review 124/2006 9 It is not clear to me that these risks are fully priced into the market. Market forces may not have been able to correct any excess optimism given the incentives and constraints of participants operating in a world with a good deal of opaqueness about risk taking. In closing, I would stress that I am not saying market participants should avoid risk. But I do think it is important that market participants recognise that risk has not gone away, and that there are limits in the ability of financial engineering to insulate the financial system in aggregate against risk. Given the rapid pace of innovation in financial markets and products and the low level of risk premia, investors may need to take particular care to understand the risks they are exposed to. More than in the past, they may need to ask some searching questions about how funds are being invested and how risks are being managed. One approach might be to put greater emphasis on stress test results as well as more conventional risk metrics. Failure to ask probing questions could prove costly for those directly involved – and, of greater concern, to others in the system – as and when the credit cycle turns. 
Lim Hng Kiang: The Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore Speech by Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Minister for Trade and Industry, at the Tokyo Stock Exchange Singapore Representative Office 10th Anniversary, Singapore, 14 December 2006. *      *      * Congratulatory remarks I am delighted to be here with you this evening to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Tokyo Stock Exchange Singapore Representative Office. Firstly, I would like to thank the Tokyo Stock Exchange for its commitment to Singapore and the region over the past decade and I hope Tokyo Stock Exchange will continue to scale greater heights in coming years.  Growth of Asia and Japan When Tokyo Stock Exchange established its overseas office in Singapore in 1996, Singapore and the region were experiencing strong economic growth with Asian economies developing at rates of about 5 to 10% per year. Today, we continue to witness the rise of Asia on the back of the twin drivers of China and India. Prospects for South-East Asia have improved considerably and Japan, after years of stagnation, is firmly back on the track of healthy sustained growth and is a major investor in South-East Asia. As of 2005, Japan's FDI into South-East Asia totaled $38 billion, and it is the top investor in Indonesia, and the third largest investor in Vietnam.  Changes in the global exchange landscape The competitive landscape in the global exchange arena has also changed significantly. Equity and derivatives exchanges are consolidating globally in the bid to establish greater market share and to expand product offerings. The New York Stock Exchange-EURONEXT cross-Atlantic merger to create the first multi-time-zone exchange, and the recently announced merger between the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange could lead to more centralized liquidity pool for derivatives trading in the US and Europe.  Asian exchanges can do more - TSE can take greater leading role The consolidation trend has yet to reach Asia and Asian exchanges may face the risk of marginalisation. In order to remain relevant, the Asian exchanges may need to explore ways to deepen collaboration and product differentiation in the face of strong competition.  In Asia, the Tokyo Stock Exchange is the largest stock exchange by market capitalization. Since its establishment in 1878, it has grown to be the 2nd largest bourse globally, with a market capitalization of its listed companies exceeding US$4 trillion, second only to the New York Stock Exchange. It also registers high average daily trading volume for domestic equities of about US$19 billion for 2005.  I understand that the Tokyo Stock Exchange is currently in talks with major exchanges about alliances and I am heartened to hear its efforts to work more closely with the Asian exchanges. For example, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Singapore Exchange have been discussing about such strategic cooperation which would benefit both markets and their investors, including the possible trading linkage, and I urge both parties to work together more closely.  We need to cultivate and foster greater bilateral, if not, multilateral cross-border relationships with each other to develop greater liquidity in regional securities and derivatives markets. The current economic growth in Japan, Singapore, as well as in the broader South-East Asian region, gives us a window of opportunity to act swiftly to deepen and enhance trading linkages so as to strengthen Asia's competitive edge. Together, I believe we can present an attractive value proposition to global investors who are looking to Asia for growth. BIS Review 124/2006 1 
Conclusion On that note, let me extend my heartiest congratulations to the Tokyo Stock Exchange on its Singapore Representative Office 10th anniversary celebration. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore have enjoyed an excellent relationship over the years and I do treasure the very important ties and partnerships between Japan and Singapore. I certainly look forward to many more years of close and fruitful cooperation between the 2 countries in future projects.  I wish Tokyo Stock Exchange great success in their endeavours. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 124/2006 
Niklaus Blattner: Global trends in financial market infrastructures and their significance for financial stability Introductory remarks by Mr Niklaus Blattner, Vice-Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 14 December 2006. *      *      * Developments at banks and financial markets are subject to extensive daily media analysis and commentary. By contrast, financial market infrastructures, i.e. stock exchanges, payment and securities settlement systems, only rarely make the headlines. I have decided to shift the focus today and concentrate on financial market infrastructures. In particular, I wish to highlight some interesting global trends and assess how these trends impact on the stability of the financial system.  Internationalisation of financial market infrastructures Traditionally, most financial market infrastructures have a strong national focus. This made sense as long as the financial markets also had a strong domestic focus. However, the deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets and the associated increase in cross-border financial flows resulted in a widening gap between financial markets and financial market infrastructures, with the latter remaining constrained within national bounds. More internationalisation of financial market infrastructures became inevitable in order to avoid a loss of competitiveness due to inefficiencies. This process of opening up market infrastructures still continues today. We can differentiate between different types of internationalisation. First, direct access to infrastructures that used to be reserved exclusively to domestic participants is now being granted more frequently to foreign participants as well. Swiss Interbank Clearing, for example, has admitted participants from abroad since the late 1990s. Second, the consolidation of infrastructures is in full swing, especially in Europe. In some cases, consolidation takes place through mergers between formerly independent systems. For example, Euroclear group integrated the formerly independent central securities depositories of the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the UK. In other instances, consolidation takes a less direct form. National infrastructures may, for example, set up mutual links to facilitate trade, i.e. the settlement of cross-border transactions. The internationalisation of stock markets has also made it possible to trade an increasing number of stocks on several different trading platforms. And finally, we have also witnessed the emergence of a few completely new infrastructures which have adopted an international – and in some cases even global – focus from the outset. A classic example is the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) system, which was designed for the settlement of foreign exchange transactions and started operations just over four years ago. It now settles transactions in as many as 15 currencies. But how has the opening up of trading centres and settlement channels, which traditionally had a domestic focus, impacted on financial stability? On the one hand, it is obvious that the adjustment of the financial market infrastructures to the special features of global financial markets may contribute to reducing risks related to the settlement of cross-border transactions. For example, the risk associated with traditional foreign exchange transaction settlements (Herstatt risk) can be largely eliminated through CLS. On the other hand, the growing interconnection and internationalisation of infrastructures result in new kinds of transmission channels (often cross-border), through which the credit or liquidity problems of individual market participants can spread to other participants. In the new environment, operational problems experienced within individual financial market infrastructures can also spread much more rapidly to a larger number of players. A working group is currently dealing with precisely these issues. It was set up by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and one of the participants is the SNB. What is already clear is that the advantages of internationalisation clearly outweigh the drawbacks so far. Any threats to financial stability would have to be countered by modifications to the systems’ architecture, the applicable rules and oversight. BIS Review 123/2006 1 
Tentative adjustment to market developments While financial market infrastructures were internationalised quite rapidly, they repeatedly lagged behind the deregulation of the financial markets. In today’s environment, it is possible for innovative financial products to gain popularity quickly and to achieve enormous trading volumes shortly after their introduction. A recent example is the rapid growth in the market for credit derivatives. While the trading volume of credit derivatives absolutely exploded in the last decade, the efficiency of the transaction confirmation and settlement processes for a long time left much to be desired. As a consequence, the backlog of concluded, yet unconfirmed transactions grew steadily. This development resulted in higher risks, since the failure to confirm a transaction jeopardises its enforceability, i.e. the possibility to net it with other transactions. This, in turn, can lead to financial intermediaries incorrectly measuring and controlling their market and counterparty risks. In the aforementioned example relating to credit derivatives, the US Federal Reserve and other leading bank supervisors had to intervene just over a year ago to oblige market participants to rapidly reduce the confirmation backlog and to promote the introduction of more efficient cross-sector procedures. Market participants should not focus exclusively on the lucrative trading aspect of future innovations, but they must also speed up the development of convincing solutions for the processing of these new transactions. Otherwise, financial stability will be jeopardised. Financial market infrastructures and banks increasingly share roles Differentiating between traditional financial market infrastructures and banks – which was straightforward 20 years ago – is becoming increasingly difficult. On the one hand, the major international banks, in particular, provide services that one would normally allocate to financial market infrastructures. For instance, their customer base is so large that it is possible for them to conclude and settle trade orders outside the stock exchange. The same holds true for the settlement of payment transactions: the larger a bank, the more payments it can settle directly through its own systems. These ‘in-house systems’ compete with the actual interbank payment system, especially if the banks’ customers are banks themselves. On the other hand, operators of financial market infrastructures are expanding into the core business of banks. For example, a number of central securities depositories and their participants are providing loans and liquidity facilities. Although this is done primarily to facilitate the settlement of securities transactions, the line of demarcation from traditional financial intermediation is becoming increasingly blurred. Also, by granting remote access or by establishing more efficient connections between the individual central securities depositories, they are offering serious competition to the traditional custodians. Technological progress has been the driving force behind this blurring of roles between financial market infrastructures and banks. Technology has enabled large banks to break into the operational field of infrastructure operators without much additional expenditure. Indeed, they have been virtually obliged to do so, in order to utilise their IT platforms to full capacity and to run them efficiently. On the demand side, the smaller financial institutions also benefit. As they outsource their back office functions to larger banks or specialised institutions, they can better focus on their core business. The infrastructure operators, in turn, are finding themselves in a situation where hardly anyone is willing to pay for traditional transaction services that have taken on a commodity character. Consequently, they are diversifying and providing services that generate a higher added value. Those infrastructure operators that are organised as profit-oriented public companies, in particular, are likely to further intensify competition with the banks in the future. This development is confronting the regulators with new challenges. Many supervisory and oversight authorities still pursue an institution-based approach. In other words, they apply different criteria to the same functions, depending on whether these functions are exercised by a bank, on the one hand, or by a stock exchange or central securities depository, on the other. Furthermore, banks and financial market infrastructures are mostly supervised or overseen by different authorities. The same applies to Switzerland. This brings with it the risk that regulatory differences are deliberately exploited. The question of whether financial market regulation needs to focus more on the function rather than on the institution so as to limit regulatory arbitrage would have to be examined. Regulation would then not be based on the legal status of an institution but on the functions actually exercised. 2 BIS Review 123/2006 
Conclusion The picture I have given you of developments in the field of financial market infrastructures is by no means complete. Other developments that should be mentioned are the tendency nowadays to attach greater significance to measures relating to contingency planning and crisis management, or the growing movement towards organising financial market infrastructures as profit-oriented public companies observed in many countries. In Europe, in particular, there is pressure to consolidate the strongly fragmented infrastructure environment. This dynamic development challenges the operators of financial market infrastructures in particular. The decision-makers at the Swiss financial market infrastructures – SWX Swiss Exchange, SIS group and Telekurs group – also have to decide how they want to position themselves strategically. This is no easy task considering that the stakeholders often pursue differing interests. In addition, there are various potential conflicts, for example between the objective of exploiting economies of scale as much as possible – which might only be possible through cross-border cooperation – and the objective of maintaining independence.

BIS Review 123/2006 1 Nils Bernstein: The role of the pension sector in the economy Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, at the Labour-Market Pension Conference 2006, Copenhagen, 26 October 2006.  *      *      * 1. Introduction Thank you for inviting me to present Danmarks Nationalbank's view of the role of the pension sector in the economy. Some of you will perhaps ask what Danmarks Nationalbank knows about the pension sector? Isn't it a bit like asking women about football? The women-and-football metaphor is not my own. It is taken from an article in the sector's membership magazine Forsikring (Insurance) from 2002, after Danmarks Nationalbank and the Danish Economic Council had voiced a critical stance on the nominal interest-rate guarantees of the pension sector. In the article it was pointed out that Danmarks Nationalbank and the Chairmanship ("Wise Men") of the Economic Council did not have a comprehensive understanding of the pension system and that we were too partial in our analyses. That is naturally one way of viewing it, which I will not reject outright. However, even though the pension sector is not a core area for Danmarks Nationalbank, we do have several interfaces.  Before I elaborate on these areas, I would like to present my perspective on the pension sector in Denmark. 2.  Perspective on the pension sector The classical Danish encyclopaedia, Salmonsen, from 1923, says: "it was formerly believed that human life should not be the subject of valuation and consequently could not be insured. Maintenance allowances, particularly life annuities, were an entirely different matter. Unlike life assurance policies, such annuities did not put a price on human life, and therefore the sale of annuities was not deemed to be unethical." Today, both life insurance and life annuities are an integral part of the pension companies' activities, and the pension sector is an important element of the economy – and its business is not deemed unethical. The sector's transactions have major implications for the individual citizen, not only because of the popularity of pension saving schemes among wage earners and the self-employed, but also due to the volume of the assets managed. Only 15 years ago, the Danes' total pension savings (via pension companies) amounted to just under kr. 350 billion, equivalent to 40 per cent of GDP. The pension prospects of large groups of the 
2 BIS Review 123/2006 population consisted solely of the state retirement pension and ATP (Labour Market Supplementary Pension), plus any private savings, e.g. home equity. Why has that changed today? Why are pensions no longer a government responsibility? Back in the 1960s and 1970s, the predominant (but not universal) view was that pensions should at all times be taken from current output. The greater the share to be allocated to pensioners, the smaller the share left for the labour force in the same years, so it did not make sense for society as such to save for pensions. The spending power of the labour force and of senior citizens had in any case to be adjusted to the current consumption potential via fiscal policy. Naturally, a nation's economic strength, and thus its ability to provide decent pensions, depended on its wealth: what was not apparent was that this wealth depended on savings in the private rather than in the public sector. Against that background there was a widespread belief that pensions should preferably be based on the "pay as you go" principle, i.e. each generation should finance the pensions of the previous generation via taxation. This also allowed for a certain degree of wealth redistribution between the affluent and less affluent members of society. This approach to pension financing was also confirmed by the experience with the Social Pension Fund. The latter was conceived in 1970 as a counter-cyclical instrument. For as long as the Fund only received contributions there were no major policy issues, but no concrete proposal for a supplementary pension financed by the Social Pension Fund was ever tabled. Instead, some of the Fund's revenue was used to finance e.g. housing allowances. In terms of communication, it was an impossible task to balance overall economic interests when designing a supplementary pension against senior citizens' expectations of disbursements from the Fund. After some years it was decided to discontinue payments into the Fund. And then there was the balance of payments. The deficits were a constant barrier to activities, and in the worst years we even sent 4 per cent of our annual output abroad as interest on our external debt. On the other hand, this meant that if we had external assets rather than debt, we would be able to spend more than we produced. This explains why politicians began to view pension savings as a means of increasing total savings in society, without considering what would happen when the pensions matured. It was indeed balance-of-payments concerns that led the government in 1987 to enter into the "joint declaration" with the two sides of industry concerning the introduction of labour-market pensions via collective agreements. Four years later, this declaration was implemented in an actual collective agreement between the Danish Federation of Trade Unions and the Danish Employers' Confederation introducing compulsory pension contributions. There were several reasons why the pensions were privately based. In my opinion, the decisive factor was the tax burden in Denmark, which by the mid-1980s had reached a level of around 50 per cent. There was broad political consensus that a further increase in taxation would lead to unsustainable imbalances in society. It could also be claimed that a pension system based on individual contributions is more robust to the development in the EU with an increasingly mobile workforce, although I am not aware that this argument was put forward. So, out of the almost universally acknowledged need for increased savings in the economy and wage earners' wish for pensions that were more in line with the incomes they had grown accustomed to, arose the mixture that became the Danish pension system. In many ways it has served us well, and it has certainly helped to solve the problem of insufficient savings in the economy. In fact, multi-pillar pension systems such as the Danish system are often singled out in international contexts as a good benchmark for countering the demographic challenges that we will face in the coming decades as the population ages. Our pension system is based on three pillars: firstly, the state retirement pension and ATP; secondly, the compulsory labour-market pensions; and finally, private pensions, including capital pensions. To this should be added equity in homes and summer cottages, as well as other savings. The system is also based on three financing pillars: financing via taxes, compulsory savings and voluntary savings. Consequently, the individual citizen's risk in relation to the size of future pension disbursements is diversified, which makes the system robust. 
BIS Review 123/2006 3 Pension savings have boomed throughout the 1990s and into the new millennium. It all started with the collective bargaining in 1991, when the two sides of industry agreed that 0.9 per cent of wages should be paid into a pension scheme. Wage earners were to pay one third, while employers were to pay two thirds. Since then we have seen a continuous increase in pension contributions in connection with subsequent collective bargaining. Today, the pension contributions of many wage earners constitute more than 10 per cent of their basic wages, and the labour-market pension funds – i.e. excluding ATP, LD Pensions and the Special Pension Fund – manage assets of approximately kr. 1,300 billion, equivalent to almost 85 per cent of GDP.  As Chart 1 shows, this figure has almost quadrupled in 15 years. For comparison, deposits in Danish banks have doubled in the same period. The prevalence and building up of labour-market pension schemes also mean that more people now have pension savings besides the state retirement pension and ATP. In 2002, 85 per cent of all wage earners working full time contributed to a labour-market pension scheme. For the entire labour force, the figure is approximately 75 per cent.  
4 BIS Review 123/2006 The percentage of wages paid into pension schemes varies considerably, however, but as the Chart shows, it is increasing. This is good news for the individual citizen, who can look forward to having more money to spend after retirement, but also for Danish society. In the longer term, demographic trends, i.e. a rising number of retired people in proportion to the labour force, will mean that disbursements from the pension funds will gradually catch up with and probably exceed payments into the pension funds. Viewed in isolation, this will strengthen government finances since pension contributions are tax-deductible while pension disbursements are taxed. We have thus seen a swelling of the balance sheet, as some of the assets managed by the pension companies are merely deferred tax, and the trend towards positive net disbursements entails the gradual realisation of the government's tax asset. On the other hand, this trend will increase spending power as a ratio of production output from today's level. Whether that will lead to actual balance-of-payments problems remains to be seen. But just imagine a situation where we had not succeeded in increasing pension savings, with pensions mainly based on current tax revenue! 3.  A safe and secure currency system Section 1 of the Danmarks Nationalbank Act from 1936 states that:   Low inflation is a precondition for a safe and secure currency system. Since 1982, Denmark has pursued the target of low and stable inflation via a fixed-exchange-rate policy. Consequently, maintaining a stable exchange rate is now one of Danmarks Nationalbank's principal responsibilities. The fixed-exchange-rate policy is a cornerstone of Denmark's economic policy. Danmarks Nationalbank has a declared objective of keeping the krone stable vis-à-vis the euro. Danmarks Nationalbank has two exchange-rate instruments at its disposal. These are intervention using the foreign-exchange reserve, and the short-term interest rate. The foreign-exchange reserve is used to manage small fluctuations in the supply of and demand for Danish kroner, while the interest rate is only used in connection with imbalances of a more sustained nature. As players in the international capital markets, the pension companies may influence the exchange rate by purchasing and selling securities. It is therefore important for Danmarks Nationalbank to keep abreast of developments within this sector. In connection with major portfolio restructuring we sometimes see large inflows and outflows of currency. If Danmarks Nationalbank does not act in such a situation, the result could be inappropriate exchange-rate fluctuations. On average, capital imports of kr. 10 billion strengthen the Danish currency by kr. 0.12 per 100 euro. Our analyses show that the pension sector's trading in foreign securities contributes to explaining changes in the exchange rate of the krone. It is interesting to note that the significance of this sector to the exchange rate appears to have increased in recent years. 
BIS Review 123/2006 5 Our analyses also show that portfolio investments to and from the euro area have a greater impact on the exchange rate of the krone than equivalent portfolio investments to and from the rest of the world. This indicates that market participants are less inclined to hedge the exchange rate on investments to and from the euro area due to Denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy vis-à-vis the euro. Portfolio restructuring by pension companies is not problematic. It is a natural element of the free movement of capital, which is a precondition for a well-functioning capital market. Fortunately, Danmarks Nationalbank has competent employees who monitor the day-to-day fluctuations in the foreign-exchange market and are therefore ready to act if the krone strengthens or weakens too much. We also appreciate the credibility enjoyed by Denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy – nationally and internationally. Let me take this opportunity to explode a myth. The fact that the Danish economy is fundamentally sound, with declining government debt and a savings surplus, is not problematic in relation to maintaining the fixed-exchange-rate policy. Any exchange-rate fluctuations arising from portfolio restructuring will only be of a short-term nature. The opposite situation – i.e. a weak economy – might constitute a problem, however. 4. Macroeconomic development – from debtor to creditor nation Danmarks Nationalbank cannot take full credit for the faith in Denmark's fixed-exchange-rate policy. Part of the explanation is that up through the 1980s Denmark managed to get its fiscal policy under control, and slowly, with a few obstacles in our path, a structural current-account deficit was turned into a surplus. Sustainable fiscal policy and a clear distribution of responsibilities in relation to economic policy make it easier for the central bank to meet its objectives. In Denmark, this distribution of responsibilities has been explicitly formulated: monetary policy is aimed at ensuring a stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the euro, while any specifically Danish need to stabilise cyclical fluctuations is handled via fiscal policy. As regards the favourable development of the balance of payments, it is obvious that the pension sector has also played a role, primarily through increased savings. As I have already mentioned, the increasing pension savings via e.g. labour-market pension schemes have influenced the economic development in Denmark in recent years. While the economic debate was previously focused on the lack of savings, with current-account deficits and government deficits, we now have a savings surplus.  One of the drivers of this development has been the increase in pension savings. 
6 BIS Review 123/2006 However, we should not forget that net savings would hardly have been positive if the real interest rate after tax had not also – in most cases – been positive, thus creating an incentive to save. The fixed-exchange-rate policy has played a vital role since it has helped to keep inflation at bay. Whether overall savings in real terms increase when compulsory pension contributions are introduced naturally depends on whether such contributions replace other savings. Calculations by the Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs indicate that the increased pension contributions have had a full impact on total savings. This means that other savings have not been supplanted by higher pension savings. The trend towards increased savings meant that by the end of 2005 Denmark had become a net creditor vis-à-vis other countries for the first time since World War II.  5.  Pension companies and financial stability At Danmarks Nationalbank we have defined financial stability as a state that exists:  In other words, the focus is on the functioning of the financial system – on the smooth provision of money in our society. The pension sector is part of the financial system and can influence financial stability in Denmark. 
BIS Review 123/2006 7 Unlike banks, pension companies have a more indirect impact on financial stability, however. Pension companies are characterised by long-term obligations which cannot be terminated overnight. This means that the risk of a "run" – i.e. a situation where all policyholders simultaneously seek to redeem their savings at short notice – is virtually non-existent. Let me emphasise that financial stability cannot merely be defined as the lack of "runs". This is an essential precondition, but not sufficient in itself. As I have already said, the focus is on the functioning of the financial system, and in that respect confidence is of paramount importance. It is essential that pension savers trust the pension companies, i.e. that they feel confident that the money will be there when it is pay-out time. The best way to ensure that is for the assets of the pension companies to fluctuate in step with the liabilities when the economic assumptions change. "Traffic lights" Today, pension companies focus more on risk management and risk hedging than they did 5-10 years ago. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has prepared risk scenarios – known as traffic lights – which are "snapshots" used to test the robustness of the pension companies to negative market development. The principle behind the traffic lights is to visualise the pension companies' investment and insurance risks so that the pension companies have time to react to a changing risk scenario before it is too late. This has undoubtedly helped to make the Danish pension sector more robust to financial and insurance risks. This has also been necessary in an increasingly more globalised world where external shocks are also reflected in the Danish economy. The introduction of new, more complex financial products makes great demands on the pension sector, but also on the authorities. It is important that the boards and managements of the pension companies understand the underlying risks in relation to a given investment or liability. Otherwise they may be in for a nasty shock one day. A case in point is the failure of LTCM in 1998. Long-Term Capital Management was a large US hedge fund specialising in building up large geared positions across several markets, financed via loans from numerous US and European financial institutions. LTCM sought to exploit imperfections in the market. The success of the strategy depended on a number of assumptions concerning the underlying market correlations and volatilities. However, with the Nobel Prize winners Myron Scholes and Robert Merton on board things could not go wrong! Nevertheless, they did. The underlying assumptions proved not to be valid in the face of turbulent market conditions, and in 1998 LTCM folded after losing 4.6 billion dollars in less than four months. Danish pension companies are scarcely likely to make equally risky investments, but the case illustrates that what does not seem very risky beforehand may subsequently prove to be so. However, stress tests such as the traffic lights do have a downside. Under turbulent market conditions such as those seen in the autumn of 2001, all pension companies are compelled to undertake major portfolio restructuring at the same time in order to observe the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority's traffic lights. This entails a risk of exacerbating a negative spiral. And players in a falling market never obtain the best prices for their assets. The solution is naturally not to abolish the traffic lights, but to seek to avoid situations where they may be inappropriate. More specifically, this means that the companies must adjust their reserves to match their risks. The responsibility of the sector The growth in Danish pension assets makes demands of the sector in terms of accountability in relation to investment behaviour, as well as product range and marketing. Both the commercial pension companies and the labour-market pension funds have increasingly encouraged customers to choose market-rate products, i.e. products where the return is more directly 
8 BIS Review 123/2006 linked to the developments in the financial markets. In this way a larger part of the investment risk is transferred to the individual policyholder. An argument often used by the pension companies when selling "market products" is that the return is typically higher than for traditional pension savings. That may well be the case, but there is usually no "free lunch". Higher expected returns invariably involve greater risk. If the customer understands and accepts this correlation, there is no problem. The problem arises in cases where advertising and "clever" marketing make customers opt for products for which they do not understand the related risk! It is therefore important that the pension companies are aware of their responsibilities as advisors. We cannot say for sure how interest rates and share prices will develop in the future. The pension company may entertain certain expectations, but no-one knows what will actually happen. So what seemed like sound advice ex ante may prove not to be so ex post. The same applies to advice based on taxation aspects. No-one knows what our tax system will look like in 20-30 years' time in relation to the structure of individual incomes. The pension sector crisis in the wake of the plummeting share prices in 2000-2002 obviously gave many companies rather a shock. Falling share prices combined with lower interest rates and rising life expectancy was a potent cocktail. One of the challenges to the sector has therefore been to avoid a similar situation in the future. Many companies have opted for solutions based on individual products, i.e. the policyholders themselves bear most of the risks. This is a remarkable development. To put it bluntly, insurance companies seek to avoid selling insurance – both insurance in relation to market developments, and in relation to life expectancy (I am thinking of the great prevalence of annuity pension policies). In this area the companies surely ought to have a comparative edge in terms of pension savings compared to the rest of the financial sector. 6.  Conclusion I have spoken of the pension sector as a unified sector, which is by no means the case. Overall, it can be divided into two subsectors of almost the same size: the labour-market pension funds, which are owned by the customers, and the commercial pension companies, which are typically part of a larger financial group. The commercial pension companies compete for customers in more or less the same way as other financial enterprises, i.e. they basically seek to convince customers that they offer the best product in relation to price. The labour-market pension funds live a more quiet life. In many cases, their members have no choice of pension fund; this has been laid down in a collective agreement. When analysing market shares in the Life and Pension sector, it only makes sense to consider the part of the sector where policyholders or enterprises have a real choice of provider. Based on this approach, the five largest pension companies accounted for approximately 90 per cent of the market at end-2005, in terms of both gross premiums and total balance sheet. 
BIS Review 123/2006 9  Competition is a good thing! Turning to the costs of the pension companies, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority states in its 2005 report on market developments for life-insurance companies and professional pension funds that the average costs of the pension schemes based on collective agreements are lower than those of the market-oriented companies. This is an interesting observation since competition should increase efficiency and thus drive costs down. I am sure that the market-based companies can list a number of good reasons explaining why this is not the case, so I will not go into further detail. I will merely point out that, unlike returns, costs can often be predicted with relatively great certainty on the basis of historical observations. Empirical studies have thus shown that costs are characterised by a considerable degree of persistence. In plain language, this means that a company that has high costs today is also likely to have high costs tomorrow. The same applies if a company has low costs. Over a working life, even small differences is cost ratios can amount to several hundred thousand kroner in savings for the individual policyholder at the time of retirement. This emphasises the importance of focusing on costs, but also the need for transparency so that customers can see what they are paying and what they are paying for. * * * Today the pension sector is an important part of the Danish economy, and there are no indications that this will change in the future. As the large wartime generation retires, and the life expectancy of the population increases, Denmark will see a number of structural changes, and the need for a well-functioning pension sector will be very obvious. It is therefore positive that the pension sector has increasing focus on risk management and risk hedging, and that a growing number of Danes are saving up for their retirement. 
Nils Bernstein: Recent economic and financial developments in Denmark Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, at the Annual Meeting of the Danish Bankers Association, Copenhagen, 6 December 2006. *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to speak here at the annual meeting of the Danish Bankers Association. The Danish economy is still booming, and there is no sign of any slowdown in the near future. The upswing started in mid-2003 and has gained momentum since then. Originally underpinned by income-tax cuts, the upswing has been gradually reinforced by the remarkable growth in the international economy. In this picture, Europe has generally lagged behind the rest of the world, but now that economic growth seems to be receding in the USA, activity is on the increase among our most important trading partners in Europe. The Danish upswing has brought unemployment down to the lowest level since the oil crisis in the 1970s. In contrast to previous upswings, the balance of payments is still strong and the government surplus rests on a sound structural foundation. However, a complete picture of the Danish economy also includes risks. The global imbalances are still significant, with the enormous US current-account deficit as the dominant feature. Overall, the imbalances are still generally expected to be redressed over time. The US economy is slowing down due to the receding housing market. The risk of more abrupt adjustment cannot be ruled out, though. However, the danger signals regarding the Danish economy come from within. The future course will depend on Denmark's ability to tackle the situation. For a long time low inflation and moderate wage increases have been the order of the day in Denmark, just like in many other countries. This phenomenon is among other things the result of growing recognition of the favourable economic effects of low inflation.  Low unemployment combined with continued robust growth in the demand for Danish goods entails a risk of the pressure on the labour market leading to higher inflation. It is well-known that this can cause unemployment to rise at a later stage. Although this is not considered to be the most likely course of events, the risk of detrimental overheating of the economy is growing. Against this background Danmarks Nationalbank has recommended – and continues to recommend – measures to dampen the overall increase in demand in order to ensure sustained favourable economic development in Denmark. Danmarks Nationalbank has noted that the government has adopted a wait-and-see approach.  As stated, the labour market will be the pivotal issue in the years to come. The number of people in the groups with the highest participation rates is declining, which sets limits to labour-force growth. All indicators point to by and large unchanged employment, in contrast to the preceding years’ increases by 70,000 since 2003 when the upswing began. The labour shortage will dampen the continued upswing.  In 2006, wage increases have been gaining momentum, and domestic price pressure has been building up gradually. It is uncertain how much this adjustment process will ultimately impact on inflation. The housing market attracts high attention, and rightly so. We have witnessed very strong increases in real property prices, especially in the Greater Copenhagen area. The most recent indicators point to continued, but more moderate, price increases. Some of the most expensive areas show signs of slightly receding prices, and in more and more cases the price when the property was first put up for sale is later reduced.  The low interest rates have been a principal driver of the growth in housing prices.  In 1998 fixed-rate loans accounted for 80 per cent of the households' total borrowing from banks and mortgage-credit institutes. This share has now shrunk to 40 per cent. So more than half of the outstanding loans are adjustable-rate or outright variable-rate loans, and it is expected to be more expensive for borrowers to service their loans in 2007 due to the increases in short-term interest rates over the last year. BIS Review 122/2006 1 
Taking into account that the households also have interest income, their net interest expenses after tax will increase by just over kr. 2 billion, or 0.3 per cent of consumption. Interest rates have the strongest impact on activity via their effect on the timing of decisions regarding consumption and investment. Despite the higher interest rates, real interest rates after tax are still very low – barely over 1 per cent in most cases. The level of interest rates therefore still has an expansionary effect on the Danish economy. The economic upswing is also reflected in the financial system. The banks' balance sheets are growing strongly. At the same time, profits are record-high, labour is in short supply, wages are on the increase and there have been cases of large bonus payments. The banks’ lending is growing by more than 20 per cent year-on-year. The breakdown on business lending and lending to households follows a familiar pattern. Lending to households enters the stage first in a consumption-driven upswing, and has shown double-digit growth rates since 2004. The banks have strongly penetrated the market for home financing with their mortgage loans. In addition, the risk appetite of many households has increased – supported by the marketing efforts of a number of banks. Business lending gathers steam later in an upswing when business enterprises invest more than their internal sources of financing can support. Business lending reached double-digit growth rates at the end of 2004, and growth has now reached 20 per cent year-on year.  The high rate of growth in lending is an average for all banks. There is considerable dispersion. For some banks lending increases by more than 50 per cent year-on-year.  The strong growth in lending is clearly reflected in the composition of the banks' balance sheets. The difference between banks’ lending and deposits has increased considerably in recent years. Total lending now exceeds total deposits by a three-digit billion kroner amount. So the banks have become increasingly dependent on financial markets to raise money-market loans from other banks and to issue securities both nationally and internationally. The individual bank will also find it important to maintain access to these sources of financing. These sources are more sensitive than traditional deposits to changes in market conditions and the assessment of the individual bank's financial performance. This could make the banks more vulnerable.  The Minster of Economic and Business Affairs is finalising a bill which will enable banks to issue covered bonds on an equal footing with the mortgage credit institutes. You may ask why it is necessary to change the Danish system of financing real property via the mortgage-credit institutes. The Danish mortgage credit system is a well-functioning and stable system, which has given owners of real property access to financing on capital-market terms, with a transparent cost structure.  Let me be blunt. This change has been imposed on us, and it does have its positive elements. It increases competition between Danish financial institutions, and gives them access to operate on the same terms and conditions as foreign credit institutions. It should also be born in mind that the amendment will not entail radical changes in Danish home financing overnight. Many adjustments have already taken place in the last couple of years. Here, I have in mind the "mortgage loans" launched by the banks with great success. Seen in this perspective, covered bonds issued by banks can promote financial stability as a stable source of financing mortgage loans, thereby covering the large deposit deficit in a more satisfactory manner.  When the covered bond legislation is amended, Danmarks Nationalbank prefers a simple, robust model. The banks have called for abolition of the current restrictions on redemption profiles and maturities. We support this wish, and at the same propose that the threshold for housing loans be reduced to 70 per cent of the property value. This would also make it easier for the institutes to comply with the requirement that a loan based on covered bonds must never exceed 80 per cent of the collateral value for the entire duration of the loan. If this entails some degree of tightening, that is not entirely unintentional. In connection with the work on covered bonds, two committees have been set up to deal with the balance principle and "joint funding", respectively. Danmarks Nationalbank's position is that the Danish balance principle could be adapted and made more flexible to bring it more in line with modern risk-management principles. In that connection it is important that a new balance principle provides the same degree of security as the existing system. Joint funding is an important issue to many of you who are present here. Market conditions dictate that issuance of bonds at favourable prices requires large volumes. At the same time, it is the wish of the Danish Bankers Association "that throughout the customer relationship the customer perceives the 2 BIS Review 122/2006 
bank as the creditor for the loan and thereby the customer's banker, even though the bank in fact just administers the loan on behalf of the funding company".  I understand that it is important for the individual bank that decisions can be made locally at the counter. However, I am not quite sure to which extent this would require changes to fundamental legal principles. Banks already act as intermediaries on behalf of other legal entities such as investment associations, insurance companies, etc. Ultimately it is up to the Ministry of Justice to assess whether this request can be met. It is Danmarks Nationalbank's assessment that the Danish banking system is currently robust . Profits are extremely good, and buffers are large, albeit declining. For the banks overall, the buffers in relation to the statutory minimum capital requirement have over the last three years fallen from 7.5 to 4 per cent of lending and guarantees. The regulation of the Danish banking sector is undergoing major changes in current years. The accounting rules have been changed so that loans can only be written down on the basis of an objective value assessment. Provisions can no longer be made on the basis of the prudent accounting principle. In 2007, the new capital-adequacy rules will come into force, so that the solvency ratio of a credit institution will be calculated on the basis of risk weights that better match the actual risk on the portfolio. The statutory capital requirement will be lower in actual terms, but will fluctuate more. I would like to emphasise that the amendments to the accounting rules and to the capital-adequacy rules mean that legislation does not to the same degree as previously provide for reserves in credit institutions. This responsibility has to a large extent been transferred to the boards and managements, and it is very important that they establish an adequate buffer when determining the solvency ratio of the individual credit institution. Finally, I would like to say that Danmarks Nationalbank is pleased to note the good performance of the financial sector, which reflects the sound Danish economy. On behalf of Danmarks Nationalbank, I would like to thank you for our fine cooperation.  BIS Review 122/2006 3 
John Hurley: The challenges ahead - SEPA and NPIP Speech by Mr John Hurley, Governor of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland, at the National Payments Conference, Dublin, 12 December 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to be able to address this inaugural national payments conference, hosted jointly by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Irish Payment Services Organisation in the historic surroundings of Dublin Castle. At the outset, I would like to say that the Central Bank fully supports the conference's broad objective of having open, ongoing and productive discussions involving everyone with an interest in Irish payment systems. I'd like to use the opportunity of this conference to address three payments-related topics, namely: • the Central Bank's role in relation to payment systems; • the Single Euro Payments Area - or SEPA, and  • to share some thoughts from the Central Bank's perspective on the National Payments Implementation Programme. Role of the Central Bank The Central Bank has significant responsibilities in the payments area. These take a number of forms. At the broadest and most important level, the Bank acts as the overseer of payment systems. My remarks today will concentrate on this function. Apart from this oversight role, we also have a significant operational function. With regard to the latter, we operate, manage and participate in the Irish real-time gross settlement system, IRIS - the system for the settlement of wholesale payments at the interbank level. We are also a participant in the local retail paper clearing system, and, of course, we fulfil the traditional central bank role of supplying cash. We have also recently agreed to take on the role of settlement agent in respect of euro-denominated securities transactions, mainly Irish equities, settled in the UK-based CREST system. This role is currently carried out by the Bank of England, and will move to the Central Bank in 2008. I should probably also mention our involvement with the recent Eurosystem initiative known as TARGET2 Securities. This is aimed at the provision by the Eurosystem of settlement facilities in central bank money for all euro-denominated securities transactions. Discussions with the banking and securities communities on this initiative are ongoing. Oversight The oversight of payment systems is a core central banking function. In carrying out this task, central banks seek to minimize systemic risk, that is the risk that the failure of any payment system participant could result in other participants being unable to meet their obligations, leading to a potentially disastrous chain reaction of failures.  Minimizing systemic risk in payment and settlement systems is not only an objective in itself. It is also a precondition for achieving financial stability and for the efficient conduct of monetary policy. These, in turn, are necessary for the integrity of the euro as a major global currency.  Our oversight role is enshrined in both domestic and European legislation. Domestically the legal basis is the Central Bank Act of 1997. In the broader European context, one of the basic tasks of the European System of Central Banks (of which the Bank is a member) is "to promote the smooth operation of payment systems". The Eurosystem is further empowered "to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Community and with other countries". BIS Review 122/2006 1 
Back in the early 1990s, central banks focussed on large-value netting systems where the safety concerns were more evident. Gradually, however, the focus of oversight has been extended, to varying degrees in different countries, to: • real-time gross settlement systems,  • retail payment systems,  • payment instruments such as payment cards, direct debits and credit transfers,  • third-party service providers,  • central counterparties, and  • securities clearing and settlement systems.  The extensive range of activities now subject to oversight reflects their potential impact on financial stability and their links to the smooth conduct of monetary policy. Central banks are organised so that their operational role in payment systems does not conflict with their oversight role.  The Bank currently directly oversees the Irish real-time gross settlement system, IRIS, and the two retail payment systems concerned with paper and electronic clearing. In doing so, it applies the provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1997 that require all payment systems operating in the State to be approved, and have their rules vetted, by the Central Bank. In approving any payment system's rules, we must have regard to the "...proper and orderly regulation of the payment system concerned and of competition between payment systems...". In assessing the soundness of these domestic payment systems, we use as reference the internationally recognised principles developed by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the central banks of the G10 countries. In addition to these direct arrangements, the Central Bank is involved in a number of co-operative oversight roles. Thus, in relation to the TARGET system, which interlinks all EU euro-denominated real time gross settlement systems, we participate in the Eurosystem's oversight arrangements. The Central Bank will continue this oversight role in relation to TARGET2, the successor to the existing TARGET system, which is due to come on stream in November 2007.  In addition to oversight of payment systems, the 1997 Act makes the Bank responsible for the oversight of securities settlement systems. However, apart from the NTMA's settlement system for Exchequer Notes, Ireland actually has no domestic securities settlement infrastructure. Trades in Irish Government bonds are settled in the Belgium-based Euroclear Bank, while trades in Irish equities settle in CREST which is located in the UK. Because of this, we have made arrangements whereby we co-operate with the National Bank of Belgium in relation to the oversight of Euroclear Bank, under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding. Discussions are on-going with the UK's Financial Services Authority in relation to a similar Memorandum of Understanding on the oversight of CREST.  These arrangements illustrate the increasingly cross-border nature of payments and settlement activities that require co-operation among central bank overseers. In my view, central banks have successfully met these challenges, as can be seen in the examples that I've mentioned showing the variety, flexibility and co-operative nature of the arrangements in which the Central Bank here is involved.  As I've already mentioned, the role of payment system oversight has expanded in recent years, and the Eurosystem is becoming increasingly involved in the oversight of payment instruments such as debit cards, credit cards and cheques and payment networks. As a consequence, the Central Bank will also become more active in this area. Naturally, the intensity of this oversight will be commensurate with the perceived potential systemic impact of these instruments. I hope that this summary of the Central Bank's payment systems role has gone some way towards explaining just what it is that we do in this field. In order to reach a wider audience it is our intention to publish, in the coming year, a detailed report on our work in the area of payments systems oversight. Our oversight role - covering, as it does, payment systems and payment instruments - leads naturally to an interest in the issues being covered here today, SEPA and the National Payments Implementation Programme. 2 BIS Review 122/2006 
SEPA Moving on to the Single Euro Payments Area (or SEPA) initiative, its aim is to advance European integration by putting in place a competitive and innovative euro-area retail payments market that should bring with it higher service levels, more efficient products and cheaper alternatives for making payments.  The origins of SEPA lie in the introduction of the euro in 1999. Although wholesale - or interbank - payments were catered for by TARGET, citizens of the participating countries did not have a comparable facility for making cross-border, non-cash, low cost, retail payments in euro, even though they shared common banknotes and coins once the euro cash changeover took place in 2002.  Even now, each national retail payments market remains essentially isolated from those of other euro-area member states, with levels of efficiency and service varying from one euro-area member state to another. As a result, cross-border retail payments in euro can be slower and less efficient than comparable payments made within any one country. This is because payment systems rules, procedures, standards and technical systems vary from country to country. Therefore, while goods and services can be traded freely across the euro area, the underlying payments are still hampered by national borders and arrangements, so that the completion of the 'internal market' is to some degree frustrated.  The SEPA project aims to ensure that all consumers throughout the euro area, whether individual citizens or corporate entities, will have available to them common retail payment instruments. In principle, at the end of the process in 2010, all euro-area bank customers will be able to use one payment account and one set of standardized instruments. This simplified payments world that will result from SEPA will be a major benefit for those who make cross-border payments.  When the SEPA project is completed, all euro area payments will, in effect, become domestic and the current differentiation between national and cross-border payments will disappear. Competition should be enhanced, since all consumers using payment services, and not just those making cross-border payments, will be able to choose between payment service providers throughout the euro area, regardless of where they might be located. This should foster innovation in the provision of payment services. It should also not be forgotten that SEPA will bring the benefits associated with a very real modernisation of payment functionality throughout the euro area. Thus, while it is acknowledged that SEPA undoubtedly involves large-scale investment by the banking industry, in the longer-run, the opening up of the euro area payments market to competition means that the industry itself should share in the benefits of this project. One very topical debate in the SEPA arena relates to how payment cards - in particular debit cards - can become SEPA-compliant. In this regard, the Eurosystem recently issued a progress report on its views on the development of the "SEPA for Cards". The challenge in this area is to ensure a successful transition to a more integrated market while at the same time preserving the efficiency and low cost levels that characterise existing national payment card schemes. SEPA migration should not lead to any deterioration in conditions for cardholders and merchants. This is an area that is being closely monitored by the Eurosystem and will be the subject of discussions with all of those involved.  While there is strong support from the Eurosystem and the EU Commission for SEPA, it remains primarily a market-driven project. The role of the Eurosystem (of which the Bank is part) in relation to SEPA is that of a catalyst, or facilitator, while leaving its implementation to the private sector. However, the Eurosystem works actively with the EPC - the European Payments Council - and market participants to ensure that the necessary planning and preparatory work is carried out in a co-ordinated way.  Since its formation in 2002, the EPC has acted as the European banking industry's decision-making and co-ordination body for SEPA, and has made significant progress towards making the project a reality, and creating a solid foundation upon which it can be built. In practical terms, the EPC is the body responsible for defining the rules, procedures and standards that will apply to the new SEPA-compliant payment instruments that the banks will use to develop competitive products to offer to their customers.  As the body with primary responsibility for the implementation of SEPA in Ireland, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend IPSO on the speedy preparation of the Irish national SEPA migration plan, which was agreed and signed off by the chief executives of all IPSO member banks in December last year; Ireland was in fact one of the first countries to complete its national SEPA migration plan. BIS Review 122/2006 3 
It is essential that the SEPA implementation and migration process include the necessary degree of engagement with all interested parties. In this regard, I am pleased to see that a SEPA Stakeholder Forum has been established by IPSO and has already held two meetings, at which government departments, public utilities, other direct debit originators and business organisations have all been represented. This is a development that the Central Bank very much encourages, and I hope that the Forum, and conferences like this one, will play a significant role in increasing public awareness of SEPA over the next couple of years. I also strongly support the focus on communication that, I understand, is planned for 2007. The European banking industry cannot, however, operate in a vacuum. SEPA is a major European objective in every sense, and public authority support for SEPA is therefore vital. As with the Eurosystem, SEPA is firmly rooted in EU Commission policy, and strongly supported and promoted by both institutions. The EU Commission sees SEPA as part of the European integration process, and will facilitate the initiative by providing a common EU legal environment via the proposed Payments Services Directive. Strong support for the SEPA project has also been expressed recently by the EU Council of Ministers of Economic Affairs and Finance, the ECOFIN Council. National Payments Implementation Programme Finally I'd like to turn to the National Payments Implementation Programme. In undertaking this programme of work, IPSO has stated that its intention is to develop a future payments infrastructure in Ireland that would be seen as a world class payments environment 'which delivers efficiencies to all sectors of the economy, is inclusive of all sectors of society, and shares the benefits universally". The Central Bank fully shares this objective and stands ready to assist, in any way that it can, the efforts of all involved in delivering the goals of the strategy. Rapid progress in implementing the Programme would do much to enhance the efficiency of the whole payments area and impact most positively on the competitiveness of the entire Irish economy. The importance of developing Ireland's payment systems infrastructure has been recognised at the highest level; as well as IPSO and its member banks, various Government departments, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator have all been involved from an early stage. It is encouraging to note that there has been extensive consultation with many other groups. The involvement of as broad a constituency as possible is undoubtedly the best way to achieve a successful outcome. The development of Ireland's payment systems infrastructure - particularly in the area of retail payments will be very much influenced by external factors, principally driven by the SEPA project. There is significant common ground between SEPA and the national payments implementation programme, with the focus in both being very much on electronic payments. Both initiatives suggest that there is little future for the cheque as a payment instrument, and certainly not in the context of making cross-border payments.  Cheques have been characterised as both expensive and relatively inefficient, and the Central Bank and the Eurosystem concur with this view. Indeed, in its SEPA 4th Progress Report, the Eurosystem went as far as to state that "Cheques...will...ultimately disappear when it becomes clear to their users that other means of payment provide better service. By 1 January 2008, it is expected that national banking communities in the euro area will have put in place a strategy for promoting the use of alternative electronic means of payment..." and that "By the end of 2010...the use of cheques...is expected to follow a clear downward trend...".  To ensure that the national payments initiative achieves its full potential, the Irish banks must offer electronic payment methods that are: • safe and efficient; • easy to use; • accessible to all, and • no more expensive than existing national instruments. The public authorities also have an important role to play in ensuring the success of the Programme by promoting, in respect of their own payments business, the use of electronic means of payments.  4 BIS Review 122/2006 
Conclusion To conclude, I hope that I have been able to clarify for you the role of the Central Bank in the payments area. I will reiterate that we stand ready to assist IPSO, the Irish banking community and others involved in any way possible to deliver on SEPA and the National Payments Implementation Programme. I would like to thank you for your attention, and also would like to extend to the participants in this afternoon's 'breakout sessions' my best wishes for a successful outcome to their deliberations.

Jens Thomsen: Brief overview of the Danish economy  Statement by Mr Jens Thomsen, Member of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, at the meeting of the Danish Economic Council, Copenhagen, 5 December 2006.  *      *      * Developments in 2006 reflect extraordinarily high demand in the Danish economy. The growth in demand will continue in 2007, but it is forecast that GDP growth will fall to approximately 2 per cent, leaving the rest of demand to be covered by net imports. This indicates that the Danish economy is close to its capacity limit. Higher wage increases are also expected. If the growth in demand for Danish goods exceeds productivity growth, the pressure on the labour market will increase, unless the supply of labour is expanded. This labour requirement can hardly be met domestically, and it is difficult to judge how far sufficient resources can be provided from abroad.  It is stated in line with Danmarks Nationalbank that even if the economy has become more flexible there is still a considerable risk of overheating. Such overheating will, as stated, lead to significantly higher wage increases, and thereby an extended period of low growth. On this basis Danmarks Nationalbank has recommended that demand be curtailed. The Economic Council also recommends a tightening of fiscal policy.  BIS Review 122/2006 1 
Nout Wellink: Goals and strategies of the Basel Committee Remarks by Dr Nout Wellink, President of the Netherlands Bank and Chairman of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, at the High Level Meeting on the Implementation of Basel II in Asia and Other Regional Supervisory Priorities, Hong Kong, 11 December 2006.  *      *      * I.  Introduction  Thank you very much for the opportunity to address this important meeting on the implementation of Basel II in Asia and other regional supervisory priorities. I would like to thank the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for hosting this event, and congratulate the FSI and EMEAP on putting together such an impressive conference program. Hong Kong is a dynamic city in this rapidly growing region, so I can think of no better place to discuss the changes that are taking place in banking and supervision.  What I would like to do this morning is talk briefly about the goals of the Basel Committee, outline the strategy and work program the Committee has in place to achieve those goals, and then provide some concluding thoughts.  II.  Goals of the Committee  As the new Chairman of the Basel Committee, I think it is appropriate at this time for me to step back and consider the broad goals and strategies of the Committee. I would like to start by sharing with you today the Committee’s objectives as I see them. In my view, the Committee has three broad objectives. One, to provide a forum for dialogue and information exchange among supervisors. Two, to promote improvements in bank risk management practices and the framework for banking supervision. And three, to promote mechanisms for pragmatic implementation of the principles developed by the Committee.  Turning to the first objective, a core goal of the Committee has always been to provide a forum for dialogue and information exchange. This helps to promote supervisory co-operation, greater consistency, and a level playing field for an increasingly global banking industry. Information sharing and dialogue also has a much broader aim, however. That is to provide the Committee with the context and perspective needed to develop policies and practices that most effectively promote a robust banking and financial system.  The second objective of the Committee is perhaps most visible to the broader community. With the insight gained from information sharing about developments in risk management, supervision and financial markets, the Committee promotes improvements in these areas. In this regard, the Committee seeks to develop and promote proportionate responses to the issues identified using a range of tools. This may include undertaking further fundamental research, preparing range-of-practice papers, or where necessary developing new policies or guidance.  Third, as you know, the policy guidance developed and promoted by the Basel Committee is based on consensus rather than on formal international legal agreements. An important objective of the Committee therefore is to promote credible, practical and flexible mechanisms to achieve effective policy implementation in a wide range of countries. The successful implementation of international policies requires processes and mechanisms that engage non-Committee supervisors, other sectors and the industry throughout the lifecycle of any initiative.  With those objectives in mind, I would now like to discuss how the Committee’s strategy is working towards achieving those goals.  III.  The Committee’s strategy and work program  The Committee’s strategy has four interrelated and reinforcing elements. The first element of the strategy is to maintain a strong capital foundation. That strong foundation is enhanced by the Basel II Framework, which many countries are now in the process of implementing. Secondly, the Committee reinforces the strong capital foundation by promoting other infrastructure needed for sound supervision. Thirdly, the Committee develops policy responses that are proportionate and flexible. BIS Review 122/2006 1 
Fourthly, the Committee is deepening and expanding its outreach to non-Committee supervisors, to other sectors, and to the industry.  Strong capital foundation  It should not come as a big surprise to you that implementation of the Basel II Framework is one of the highest priorities on our current work program. Integrating an effective approach to supervision, incentives for banks to improve their risk management and measurement, and risk-based capital requirements are fundamental objectives of Basel II. By definition, we don’t know where the next economic or financial shock will come from. Our focus, therefore, is on the important role of capital as a key shock-absorber for individual banks, and for the banking system more generally, no matter what the next shock entails.  The implementation of Basel II reflects the reality that simple risk measures, such as those embodied in Basel I are, for the largest and most complex banking organisations, no longer very meaningful. A strong capital foundation requires a risk-sensitive capital framework that is flexible to adapt to innovation. Moreover, it should promote improvements in bank risk management and supervisory practices, and enhance transparency and market discipline. The three pillars of Basel II have been developed with those goals in mind.  I would also like to emphasise that the choices that individual countries make with respect to the timing of implementation of Basel II, and the menu of options available in Basel II, should consider the development of their banking and supervisory systems, and financial markets. This leads me to my next point – the importance of other supporting infrastructure.  Other supporting infrastructure  For risk management and supervision to be effective and efficient, it is not sufficient to just have a sound capital framework. The second element of the Committee’s strategy is to get the basic supporting infrastructure in place. The development of the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, the Committee’s liaison with international accounting bodies, and the Committee’s work on cross-sectoral bodies such as the Joint Forum are examples of our efforts to promote the fundamental infrastructure needed for a sound banking system and for effective supervision.  Building the foundations for effective supervision and promoting the prudence and integrity of financial accounts are an integral part of the Committee’s current work. A sound system of accounting and provisioning underpins the integrity of risk measures, capital adequacy and meaningful market discipline.  Moreover, as many of you here would know too well, it is not enough to just focus our attention on the implications of our policies for banks as the traditional lines between the various financial sectors become less clear. It is therefore important to understand the implications of market developments and supervisory changes on non-bank financial institutions and financial markets more generally.  Supervision is not all about sophisticated modelling approaches. Rather it is about understanding the risks that a bank faces and promoting better management of those risks. Used appropriately, advanced modelling approaches can help a bank to refine and sharpen its ability to measure, monitor and control risk. Used inappropriately however, and without an understanding of the limitations and assumptions built into such models, the costs may be greater than the benefits. In this respect, I view the infrastructure supporting the capital foundation as vitally important.  An initiative that the Committee will begin work on is the so-called “definition of capital”. Over the past decade we have witnessed significant advances in the way banks manage their economic capital, as well as the development of new and innovative capital instruments. The definition of capital topic highlights the importance of the supporting legal and accounting infrastructure, and the need to understand market dynamics within and across jurisdictions. At this stage, the Committee’s work in this area will focus on a stocktaking of the issues.  Proportionate policy and flexible frameworks  The third element of the Committee’s strategy is to promote proportionate policy responses, and to develop flexible policy frameworks. The Committee promotes a range of supervisory methods and advocates proportionality in supervisory approaches. The supervisory tools may include better 2 BIS Review 122/2006 
regulation, supervisory guidance, or range-of-practice papers. In addition, in some cases, industry-led solutions may be the best approach.  To respond to the accelerating pace of financial innovation and globalisation we need flexible frameworks. Both the Core Principles and Basel II are examples of global standards that were developed for local application. Both initiatives are flexible and responsive to innovation. For example, Basel II provides a menu of options to suit institutions with a range of complexity. Moreover, the more advanced approaches are based on the modelling approaches developed by advanced banks – allowing regulatory and banking models to develop together.  Over the past ten years, we have observed significant changes in international capital flows, greater reliance on market funding in many jurisdictions, and banks becoming more active buyers and sellers of complex financial instruments. In light of the central role that banks play in providing liquidity, I believe that liquidity risk management is an area where it would be appropriate for the Committee to do some exploratory work. I believe there is much that can be gained from sharing information on supervisory approaches to assessing liquidity, and bank tools for managing liquidity, particularly during stress scenarios.  In this and all cases, I expect that the Committee’s response will be proportionate to the risks identified, and that the policy tools that the Committee employs will be designed to achieve the maximum benefit for the least cost. I also expect the Committee will consult widely in the process of developing its views on the issues and then deliberating on possible responses.  Proactive outreach  This brings me to the fourth element of the Committee’s strategy, which is to engage in proactive outreach. This encompasses outreach to non-Committee countries, to the industry and to other sectors.  The Committee’s dialogue with non-Committee member countries is an extremely important element of its strategy. This stems from the need to promote the development of sound supervisory practices in developing markets and to accommodate the growing importance and sophistication of non-Committee member banks, supervisors and markets. In addition, it is critical that we address home-host coordination issues that arise with the growth of cross-border banking. These trends, and the resulting need for dialogue, are quite clear when we look at the growing and changing financial landscape and the increasing trend towards market liberalisation in the Asian region.  As an indication of the importance the Committee places on its outreach strategy, at its October meeting in Merida the Committee agreed to the establishment of the International Liaison Group (ILG). This group will replace the Core Principles Liaison Group, which with the completion of the revised Core Principles had completed its mandate. The new ILG will report directly to the Committee, and allow for broad supervisory dialogue on a range of issues. The ILG will provide a platform for non-member countries to contribute to new Committee initiatives early in the process, and to develop new proposals. The ILG will also initiate its own work streams on issues that are of interest to the broad supervisory community.  I should also highlight the important relationship the Committee has with the FSI, which provides an outstanding program of training events and tools for supervisors around the globe. Members of the Committee and its Secretariat have been actively involved in FSI events since its founding, and we see this as a key element of outreach and dialogue to the wider supervisory community.  By engaging in dialogue at a range of levels - within the supervisory community, with the industry, with representatives from other sectors, and also with other interested parties - the Committee aims to identify and address the most important risk issues. This process of filtering issues may lead the Committee to consider new initiatives from time to time. However, in most cases the exchange of information and ideas on a given topic, and making more transparent to industry the range of practices we see in a rapidly developing area, may be the most important outcomes.  IV. Concluding thoughts  I would like to conclude by summarising the main themes of my talk. The committee’s goals are, in my view, to provide a forum for information sharing, to promote improvements in risk management and BIS Review 122/2006 3 
banking supervision, and to promote mechanisms that facilitate consistent local implementation of global policies and principles.  The Committee has a multi-faceted strategy to achieve its goals, which is developed within the context of developments in international banking and financial markets. The strategy and work program that the Committee has in place are built around the cornerstone of a strong capital framework. This is supported by other fundamental infrastructure, which includes strong accounting; the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and cross sector collaboration. Proportionality and flexibility are overarching themes that permeate our policy work. Finally, the Committee’s strategy of proactive outreach and dialogue is critical to the long-run success of the work undertaken today.  Thank you.  4 BIS Review 122/2006 
Stanley Fischer: The openness of Israel’s economy to the global economy and  the importance of Israel’s joining the OECD  Address by Professor Stanley Fischer, Governor of the Bank of Israel, at the Globes Business Conference 2006, Tel-Aviv, 11 December 2006. *      *      * The subject of my address to you today is the openness of Israel’s economy to the global economy, and I will focus on the importance of Israel’s joining the OECD. A.  The state of the economy First, I would like briefly to review the state of the economy, and that picture is quite a rosy one. The economy is recovering rapidly after the war in the north, even faster than we thought at first. National Accounts data indicate a 1.4 percent decline (in annual terms) in GDP in the third quarter. The impact of the hostilities on GDP was weaker than we had assessed previously, and it appears that the rate of growth in 2006 will be 4.8 percent, slightly higher than our initial post-war forecast. Our forecast for 2007 still indicates healthy growth of 4 percent. This was our assessment immediately after the hostilities, and I will not be surprised if it is revised upwards in the future. Furthermore, the most recent unemployment data point to a reduction in the rate of unemployment in the third quarter to 8.3 percent, compared with 8.9 percent in the third quarter of 2005, alongside a rise in the rate of participation in the labor force during 2006. The nominal-financial side completes the picture of a strong economy. Inflation is low, the financial markets are functioning well, including the foreign currency market, which reflects not only global developments but also the large inflow of foreign investment to Israel and the impressive surplus in the balance of payments current account (expected to reach 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007). At this point I would like to refer to the fact that currently inflation is below the lower limit of the target range. At the outset I must state the obvious: external shocks have a significant impact on inflation, and the effects can be strong and immediate. Why do I say this? You will remember that in the first half of the year the rate of inflation over the previous twelve months was above the upper limit of the range, about 3.5 percent. Now, after a cumulative drop of 1.5 percent in September and October, the rate has fallen to below the lower limit. The Bank of Israel’s approach is to try to bring the rate back gradually within the range, and if possible to the midpoint of the range, with a one year forward horizon. The underlying reason for this approach is to avoid causing inflation volatility by sharp changes in the interest rate. Take the following situation as a hypothetical example: the Bank of Israel is acting to keep inflation in the next twelve months close to the midpoint of the target, i.e., 2 percent a year. But let us say that in the next ten months the rolling twelve-month inflation rate is below the lower limit of the range because of the drop in the index of 1.5 percent in September and October mentioned above. We may only see the twelve-month retrospective inflation rate within the target when those two months have dropped out of the calculation. We could have acted differently and reduced the interest rate drastically to bring inflation back within the target much more quickly, but then we could have created an unstable process of overshooting in the opposite direction, with inflation exceeding the target. It is therefore not worthwhile reacting to every shock as it occurs, but it is preferable to persist with the policy of gradually reverting to the inflation target within a year. B.  The openness of the economy Now to my main topic for today, the openness of Israel’s economy to the global economy. This is an important issue because economic openness is a new reality that affects all of us, but we may not have internalized it in all areas. This conference, and others like it, take pride in the many and important participants from abroad, and this provides one indication of the new reality in which we live. Israel was one of the first countries to realize that a small economy cannot grow without being open to and participating in the global economy. As early as the 1960s we set out on the path of liberalization of international trade. But the program of exposing the economy to abroad in the mid-1980s and the BIS Review 121/2006 1 
liberalization of the foreign currency market and capital flows initiated by the Bank of Israel in the 1990s were the most significant aspects of this process. It was not just that they opened the economy to the global economy, but they created a framework for macroeconomic policy that operates according to the norms accepted in the advanced economies, based on budget and inflation targeting. This provides the infrastructure that enables the economy to achieve sustained growth, provided that the policymakers know how to face the challenges that it places before them. This is even more the case when there is no general consensus on the matter of fiscal discipline. We sometimes speak of changes in economic policy, and such changes were essential to developments in the last fifteen years. We must however recognize one important fact: growth derives from the increase in the private sector, and in Israel we have a private sector that in the main is successful, innovative and creative. It is a private sector that day after day proves its ability to compete in the world. Israel’s economy is very open to the world, and this is reflected in various ways: 1. In the current decade (2000–06) the share of exports in GDP has reached an average of about 40 percent. 2. In the same period the share of imports in GDP has reached an average of about 41 percent. 3. Foreign investments in Israel reached about $ 17 billion in January–October 2006, an all-time peak. 4. Israelis’ investments abroad in January–November 2006 reached about $ 21 billion, of which some $ 12 billion were direct investments. 5. Israel is in second place (after the US) in terms of the number of companies listed for trading on the Nasdaq. What is required of an economy that is open to competition from around the world? There are still areas in which we ought to improve, and here I will refer to aspects in the microeconomic sphere. In this context I would like to mention the Doing Business Report of the World Bank, which grades countries according to the ease of doing business in them. Israel is listed 26 out of 175, not bad at all. But if we look at the different components that go into this grading, we will see that we were good in certain aspects (investor protection, obtaining credit, international trade, opening and closing a business), but we scored very badly in others (obtaining licenses, enforcing contracts and registering assets). It is very important that we take steps to improve in these areas in order to contribute to a better business environment. We generally relate to these areas as if they are important for foreign investors. But they are important for all investors in Israel’s economy, domestic and foreign. Every Israeli investor has the choice of investing abroad. If we do not improve the atmosphere surrounding investment in Israel, we are likely to lose some domestic investments of Israeli investors’. C. The OECD The subject of the openness of Israel’s economy brings me to the question of Israel’s joining the OECD. What is the OECD? It is an organization of 30 countries that are committed to democracy and a market economy, most of them among the most advanced economies. Among the members are the US, Japan, Canada, Australia, and European countries. The OECD cooperates with about 70 other countries, and its activities encompass a wide range of fields, such as macroeconomics, finance, foreign trade, investments and capital flows, taxation, education, the quality of the environment, science and innovation, the energy market, social policy, market structure (with the emphasis on competition), companies’ organizational structure, and transparency. The OECD deals with the creation of rules of conduct in these spheres with the objective of promoting international agreements necessary for the global economy. Most of the work of the OECD is performed by intergovernmental teams, and thus its reports are based on the information provided by member governments. In the OECD forums countries exchange information and knowledge, devise methods for confronting economic problems, identify and formulate standards of appropriate conduct in all the relevant economic areas, and develop ways of improving coordination and cooperation 2 BIS Review 121/2006 
between them. Representatives of member countries operate within a framework of some 200 specialist committees in the various policy areas. Why is it important for Israel to join the OECD? Membership would offer the following advantages: 1. It would promote Israel’s position in the important world economic forums, and would strengthen its economic ties. 2. It would enable us to be “in the know” at a relatively early stage of the formulation of standards in the sphere of economic policy, to adapt policy to those standards, and even to contribute from our own experience. 3. It would help us to promote economic reforms. 4. It would also help improve Israel’s rating in the international financial markets. What is Israel’s current position vis-à-vis the OECD? Israel’s economy is open, per capita GDP is high, and the degree of economic openness is good, and even excellent in certain fields, such as R&D. All these give Israel a standing as a potential member of the OECD. Moreover, since 1996 Israel has participated in various formats and committees of the OECD, mainly in the role of observer. The OECD is currently in the process of making decisions about the number of new members to be accepted into the organization, how the expansion will be implemented, and the standards to be required from the new members. These decisions are expected to be taken shortly before the Conference of Ministers in May 2007. Acceptance of a new member country requires a consensus among the member countries. Professionals and specialists in the government, the Bank of Israel and other relevant bodies are in contact with the OECD with regard to Israel’s acceptance as a full member, and we hope there will be a consensus among existing members on the question of our membership. It is important that Israel’s membership of the OECD remain high on the agenda of the various entities involved in this matter, and that progress is made in the areas that need special attention. This is a significant stage in the integration of Israel as an open, modern economy into the global economy. I hope we make it. Thank you. BIS Review 121/2006 3 
Ardian Fullani: Bank of Albania – progress during 2006  Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at the “Round Table on Target Inflation 2”, Tirana, 8 December 2006. *      *      * Ladies and gentlemen, I want to conclude this Round Table by thanking you all for your contributions. We are really happy that you came to Tirana for discussing the monetary policy strategy of the Bank of Albania. This Round Table on Inflation Targeting was an excellent follow-up of the Open Forum. At the Open Forum last year in December we globally discussed the many preconditions for Inflation Targeting. During these two days of the Round Table, yesterday and today, we went far deeper on these complex issues. These issues need to be solved before the Bank of Albania can put a fully fletched Inflation Targeting regime into place.  At this Round Table we have discussed the progress that the Bank of Albania has been making during 2006. One of the discussed topics was the econometric modeling and forecasting. The Bank of Albania uses now a reliable analytical framework that provides information useful to the monetary policy decision making. Under Inflation Targeting more information would be needed about the expected inflation developments in the future. As laid down in the central bank law, the primary objective of the Bank of Albania is to achieve and maintain price stability in Albania. For keeping prices stable we need to be able to forecast the development of prices in the future. Our current econometric models provide us information about these future developments. Our internal studies show now that the Bank of Albania is able to make reliable forecasts.  We also discussed the consequences of situations where the consumer price index increases, let us say, more than 3% at an annual basis. This may for instance happen due to higher electricity prices, or higher oil prices. These energy prices are a main share of our daily expenditures. Therefore, they are a main share of the total basket of consumer prices for the “average” Albanian household. However, the focus of our discussions was the analyses of the further impact on the Albanian macro-economy. Higher prices will lead to a lower purchasing power. Households will buy less in case of a price increase, under the condition of unchanged household income. Then, if many households in Albania start consuming less, the Albanian economic growth will suffer. The Albanian production will slow down due to the overall lower demand for goods and services.  This process can take some time. But, anyhow, each economist will agree that strong increases in prices are bad for the economy. A high inflation, that is another way of saying a strong increase in prices, will harm economic growth. The Bank of Albania aims at an average increase of the consumer price index of 3%. The Bank of Albania will set the interest rate for keeping expected price increases to 3% plus or minus 1 percentage point. It has built a macro-econometric model with all these channels that transmit monetary policy in the Albanian economy. The main purpose of the model is to analyze the reaction of prices, private consumption and business investment and so on, in reaction to changes that may take place. We call these changes in analytical terms “shocks” to the economy. Our macro-econometric model is promising. Very promising. But for building econometric models we need statistics. Albania has statistics, but we need better statistics. For the year to come, the Bank of Albania wants to improve the statistical framework. The Bank of Albania needs better statistics, I said. With “better” statistics I mean here “more” statistics, “reliable” statistics and “user-friendly” statistics.  We need to measure all macro-economic developments in the economy better. And we need to keep track of these developments. Our Albanian history is still short. We only have time series for about 15 years. In time we will logically have longer time series. Our time series need to become timely available and they should be fully understandable.  Inside the Bank of Albania we can work more on statistics. In the year 2007 the Bank of Albania will improve its own database on monetary and financial statistics, and on the balance of payment BIS Review 121/2006 1 
statistics. But, for other statistics we depend upon our national statistical office, INSTAT. We also depend on other institutions for providing us with relevant information.  Next to the broadening and deepening of the statistical framework the Bank of Albania will improve upon its communication with the public. We discussed during this Round Table the transparency of the Bank of Albania. We concluded that significant progress has been achieved.  But next to transparency, the Bank of Albania wants to improve upon the information that it provides to the public. The Bank of Albania aims at making monetary policy understandable to everybody. We know already that money matters. The more money we possess, the more we can buy, and the more our economy will grow. The more our economy grows, the more people can share. Poverty will be reduced. But what about monetary policy? We all know that higher wages or lower prices are beneficial for our personal pockets. The higher the wages, or the lower the prices, the more we can buy. But for the Albanian economy as a whole, there is a flipside. This flipside is inflation.  More spending will lead to higher prices in the medium to long term. And these higher prices, I can also say “higher inflation”, is damaging for the Albanian economic growth. For this reason the Bank of Albania safeguards price stability. Our main task is to keep prices stable. In order to do so, we set the main interest rate.  The Bank of Albania wants to communicate better on all these monetary policy issues. It wants to explain the monetary and financial benefits at the micro and at the macro level. It wants to explain better why it is aiming for an inflation rate of 3%. The communication strategy of the Bank of Albania is to explain the working of the monetary policy issues and its own tasks, to you all.  The understanding of the public is needed for a good conduct of Inflation Targeting. Credibility has to be gained. As said before, a solid statistical framework is also indispensable. Reliable statistics can tell us about the past and the present. On the basis of this, the Bank of Albania can use its econometric models to forecast the future. The Bank of Albania can conduct monetary policy, and can target inflation better, in case of better forecasts. We can stress the preconditions. But the fulfillment of all preconditions for Inflation Targeting depends also on others in the Albanian economy. Under Inflation Targeting, the monetary policy aims at a precise inflation target in the medium term. The Bank of Albania can only reach this target in case the interest rate setting affects the deposits, credits, private consumption and business investment, GDP, like in a developed market economy. Only in this case can monetary policy be effective.  Therefore, some preconditions for putting full fletched Inflation Targeting in place can not be met ONLY by the Bank of Albania. They depend upon the development of the Albanian economy, they depend upon the provision of statistics by INSTAT and others, they depend upon the understanding of the public. They also depend upon other key players like the Ministry of Finance and they depend upon the efficient working of the financial markets. Other preconditions for Inflation Targeting can partly be met by the Bank of Albania.  The full implementation of Inflation Targeting can therefore take place ONLY conditionally.  One can compare this situation with the tailoring of a suit for a special occasion. Let me make this comparison. One can find a good tailor and ask him to make a suit for a special occasion. All measures can be taken, such as the length of the arms and the length of the legs. The suitable materials can be found. One needs the appropriate fabric, in the appropriate color. Upon all these preconditions of (1) the good tailor (2) the precise measures (3) suitable materials, the tailor can start the tailoring of the suit. But, there is still no guarantee that the suit will fit you perfect. Or, it may happen that you look appealing in the tailor-shop, but not at the day of the special occasion. For instance, the temperature may have fallen so that you need an additional coat, or even a different fabric. Or, the environment of the special occasion may make you look overdressed. You tried to make it perfect, but the environment is lagging behind. Factors that you could not influence yourself can make you look different from how you had wished to look with the new suit. Conclusion: The suit is not suitable, or better, the suit is not (yet) suitable. For this reason we have to try the tailored suit regularly. All preconditions for Inflation Targeting need to be checked and re-assessed on a regular basis.  2 BIS Review 121/2006 
At this Round Table we discussed econometric modeling, statistics and communication, also the legal framework, the internal governance at the Bank of Albania and the arranged agreements with the Ministry of Finance and INSTAT. During this year we drafted the new Banking Law. This law increases customer protection, sets the legal grounds for credit information registry, introduces new rules for risk administration, bringing more confidence in the banking system as well. With the assistance of the IMF legal department we revised the agreement with the Ministry of Finance. These agreements were standardized to emphasize the role of the Bank of Albania as fiscal agent. Moreover this agreements aim at creating a cooperative and partnership environment. We remain committed to further increase cooperation with major governmental agencies to ease their proper understanding of monetary policy process, its implications and the need for harmonized and coordinated policies.  Concluding I would like to underline that we are carefully evaluating the degree to which these preconditions are met before shifting to fully fledged inflation targeting in the medium run. Such strategy will further increase the effectiveness of the monetary policy in Albania further consolidating the price stability and contributing to sustainable economic growth. We will re-assess all preconditions regularly through these types of meetings with foreign professionals. In the meantime we are establishing a professional dialog among central bank, INSTAT, Ministry of Finance and other government institutions.  Once more, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your contributions. I wish you a safe return back to your home countries. BIS Review 121/2006 3 
BIS Review 121/2006 1 Lucas Papademos: ECB Financial Stability Review December 2006 Opening remarks by Mr Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the European Central Bank, at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2006 ECB Financial Stability Review, Frankfurt am Main, 11 December 2006. *      *      * I. Introduction  Welcome to this press conference for the fifth issue of the ECB’s semi-annual Financial Stability Review which is being published today.  The financial stability assessment contained in the December 2006 issue of the Review is based on close collaboration between ECB staff and the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee. In addition, this particular issue draws upon information that was obtained from a series of informal discussions that were held with investment banks, hedge funds and credit rating agencies. It reflects information that was available up to 3 November 2006. This issue of the Review broadly follows the structure that was adopted in previous issues, although the assessment of the hedge fund sector is now included in the first Chapter in an expanded section on global financial institutions.  Some thematic financial stability topics are addressed in a total of 16 boxes and there are also five Special Feature articles in this issue. These are concerned with the following topics: (i) a methodology for identifying a set of large and complex banking groups for financial system stability assessment; (ii) an analysis of the information content of credit default swap index tranches for financial stability assessment; (iii) a methodology for analysing episodes of dynamic credit growth in Central and Eastern Europe; (iv) an assessment of systemic risk in the insurance sector and (v) a review of the EU arrangements for financial crisis management.  In presenting the main findings of the analysis, I will broadly follow the structure of the Review – as outlined on slide 2. In particular, I will discuss the main sources of risk and vulnerability for euro area financial stability we have identified in: (i) the external environment; (ii) global and euro area financial markets; (iii) the euro area corporate and household sectors and (iv) euro area financial institutions. Then I will conclude with an overall assessment of the outlook.   
2 BIS Review 121/2006 II.  Developments since the June 2006 assessment  Before doing this, let me start by recalling our assessment of last May when the June FSR was finalised and what has happened since then. In May, several vulnerabilities had been assessed as being capable of posing material risks to the euro area financial system. Given these vulnerabilities, there had been some concern that the shift to less accommodative monetary policies in the major economies and the occurrence of a number of shocks could have resulted in disorderly adjustments in asset prices by exposing “stretched” asset valuations in some markets and “overextended” balance sheets. This did not happen.  The gradual shift to less accommodative monetary policies in all major economies proceeded smoothly. The system endured several shocks over the past six months. For instance, there was a bout of volatility across a broad range of financial markets during May and June but the markets comfortably absorbed the disturbances and no major financial institution was significantly impacted by the event.  It should also be recalled that there had been some anxiety that disruptive asset price dynamics could have been triggered by an idiosyncratic collapse of a large hedge fund. However, the plunge into financial distress in September 2006 of Amaranth Advisors had little discernible impact on markets.  Against this background, in the euro area over the past six months, conditions for raising funds in the credit and equity markets remained favourable, there was a further and broad-based improvement in the profitability of banks, and the balance sheets of insurance companies were strengthened further. In addition, key financial infrastructures – including payment systems such as TARGET, and securities clearing and settlement systems – remained robust and continued operating smoothly.  III.  Overview of the main risks and vulnerabilities  III.1 External environment  Turning to the current assessment and starting with the external environment, a global source of medium-term risk for the stability of financial systems continues to be the large global financial imbalances, despite some rebalancing of global growth patterns and recent declines in oil prices [see slide 3].  While there are indications that global financial imbalances have been widening at a slower pace than before, they are not expected to narrow significantly in the short term. The prolonged accumulation of expanding US current account deficits has been a source of unease because the financing of these deficits relies on the continuation of capital inflows from surplus emerging market economies and oil-producing countries [see chart on the left of slide 3].  Commodity price swings, especially in the oil markets, can also pose risks for financial stability through various channels both indirectly and directly. Indirect effects pass through macroeconomic channels as high and volatile oil price levels pose risks for economic growth and inflation with potential adverse effects on asset prices. As regards direct effects, there are indications that speculative activity in the markets for derivatives on oil as well as in other non-oil commodities has been increasing. An example of the risks that can be posed by such activity in non-oil commodities markets was the episode involving the Amaranth Advisors hedge fund that collapsed in September. The fund ran into difficulties after its leveraged bets in the natural gas futures market – which had been predicated on expectations of hurricane frequency and intensity that did not materialise – suddenly turned sour.  Regarding oil spot prices, after reaching new historical highs in early August, they subsequently declined substantially but have remained at high levels. The decline was mainly attributable to a reduction in geopolitical tensions, a receding threat of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and an easing of petrol market tightness. All of these factors led to a decline in speculative positions which contributed to the rather abrupt downward adjustment in the price of oil. Looking forward, the implied probability distribution of future oil prices, extracted from options contracts, indicates that considerable uncertainty surrounds near-term oil futures prices, with very wide confidence intervals. Moreover, the balance of risks is tilted towards the upside [see chart on the right of slide 3].   
BIS Review 121/2006 3  III.2 Global and euro area financial markets  When assessing the potential risks in the global and euro area financial markets, two main sources of vulnerability can be identified. The first concerns the persistently low levels of long-term interest rates and credit spreads which have been associated with a “pricing for perfection” in corporate sector capital (credit) markets and emerging economy debt markets in the sense that valuations in these markets appear to be based on very favourable expectations regarding future economic outcomes and low risk premia. The second concerns the growth in the volume and complexity of credit derivatives markets, coupled with the increasing presence of hedge funds in these markets.  An abundance of liquidity in global financial markets, although its rate of growth has moderated, together with very high saving rates in some emerging market regions relative to domestic investment opportunities partly explain why long-term interest rates and credit spreads have been remarkably unperturbed by the shift to less accommodative monetary policies in the G3 economies and the resulting withdrawal of global liquidity. Rising short-term interest rates have instead produced flatter, or inverted, market yield curves in the six months following the finalisation of the June 2006 FSR. [see chart on the left of slide 4] The renewed “conundrum” of low long-term government bond yields seems, in part, related to very low risk premia. It should also be noted that several demand-related factors, such as bond purchases by euro area insurance corporations and pension funds, might have played some role in keeping long-term bond yields at low levels, although it is difficult to quantify the impact with precision.  As already noted, the bout of volatility across a broad range of financial markets during May and June 2006 was comfortably absorbed both by markets and institutions. However, to the extent that the “search for yield” in a low interest rate environment has led to this “pricing for perfection” in other financial markets, long-term rates and risk premia could have been driven too low especially in credit markets and those of emerging market economies [see chart on the right of slide 4]. This means that valuations in these markets could prove vulnerable to several potential unanticipated adverse disturbances including a renewed spike in oil prices, a pick-up in the demand by non-financial firms for external funds should profitability weaken, or a change in global asset allocation. Such triggering events could have the potential to bring about possible abrupt increases in bond yields, spreads and risk premia across mature and emerging capital markets.  
4 BIS Review 121/2006  If a triggering event of sufficient severity were to occur, it could bring about an abrupt increase in long-term yields, and credit and equity risk premia across mature capital markets and emerging market economies. This would imply significant asset portfolio losses for banks and other financial institutions. More importantly, it could also raise the counterparty risks some banks face vis-à-vis hedge funds in case it would trigger a cluster of hedge fund failures.   As to the second issue for financial markets, credit derivatives markets have been growing at an exponential rate over recent years, not only in terms of size but also in terms of the complexity of products. [see slide 5] The development of these markets is undoubtedly contributing to the efficiency and stability of the financial system by allowing financial intermediaries to measure and manage their 
BIS Review 121/2006 5 credit risks more efficiently and effectively, primarily by buying protection in the credit default swaps (CDS) market.  At the same time, there have been concerns that rapidly increasing credit risk transfer (CRT) activity may be leading to concentrations of risk among agents who might not be able to bear it in a more challenging environment, particularly in the case of the more complex structured credit products where investors may have been attracted by high short-term returns.  In 2003, the Banking Supervision Committee undertook an important survey on CRT activity. But so much has happened since then – especially in terms of the substantial growth of the market and the increasing participation of hedge funds in taking on credit risk exposures – that at the current juncture, the available data are insufficient to make a sound assessment of these risks. Should current trends continue, they will imply fundamental changes in the methods for assessing the ability of the financial system to cope with unexpected credit cycle deterioration.  After the finalisation of the June 2006 FSR, some hedge funds endured financial losses, mainly as a consequence of turbulence in financial markets during May and June. Subsequently, there were some highly publicised adverse developments in the hedge fund sector related to the collapse of Amaranth Advisors, a large multi-strategy fund. Nevertheless, the hedge fund sector continued to benefit from steadily increasing investor demand. [see slide 6] Capital under management by hedge funds has been growing very rapidly and has reached close to one trillion US dollars. [see chart on the left of slide 6] Given this size of the sector, a growing concern is that trades are becoming increasingly crowded. Higher correlation of hedge fund returns could be an indication of this. During the first half of 2006, correlations among and within hedge fund strategies remained relatively stable.   It is noteworthy that the collapse of Amaranth Advisors in September did not lead to wider turbulence, despite the fact that the total loss experienced by the fund was much larger than that incurred by LTCM in 1998. The ability of the system to absorb the shock demonstrated that the hedge fund sector has become more mature and has the ability to repair itself in the event of idiosyncratic distress. However, it should also be recalled that this event occurred against a backdrop of rather benign market conditions, and it cannot be excluded that in a more challenging market environment, such as that which characterised markets after the Russian crisis in August 1998, the impact of such an event could have been more disruptive.  
6 BIS Review 121/2006 New risks have emerged related to what could be called a “triangle” of vulnerability connecting the state of the credit cycle (which could deteriorate in the future), credit derivatives and hedge funds [see slide 7]. On the one hand, a marked adverse turn in the credit cycle, triggered either by a large and unexpected credit event, such as the collapse of a large corporation, or by a cluster of defaults by smaller and highly leveraged low-quality corporations, could lead to substantial payment obligations for counterparties which have provided credit risk protection. If these counterparties were found not to be in a position to sustain the losses, credit risk “insurance” might not be available when claims are ultimately made. On the other hand, if the functioning of the credit risk transfer market were impaired, for instance if financial market volatility rose unexpectedly, this could have an adverse impact as banks might not then be able to lay-off their credit risk in the way they have become accustomed which could, in turn, induce greater caution in their lending to lower quality borrowers in particular.    III.3  Euro area corporate and household sectors  Turning to developments in the euro area corporate sector, over the past six months there have been mounting signs that an adverse turn in the credit cycle seems increasingly likely, driven by factors such as rising leverage ratios, a further tightening of monetary conditions and expectations of a future slowdown in the pace of profit growth. A favourable economic environment together with the persistently low cost of issuing corporate sector debt and greater investor appetite for lower quality credit have created conditions that have been conducive to a surge in global merger and acquisition (M&A) activity [see chart on the left of slide 8], and in particular of leveraged buy-outs (LBOs). Such transactions have become an important source of growth in leveraged loans.1 [see chart on the right of slide 8] The rapid growth in the value of LBO transactions has taken European leveraged loan issuance beyond levels last seen at the height of the telecom boom of the late 1990s. At the same time, the average degree of leverage in these loans – measured by debt-to-EBITDA ratios2 – has increased substantially. As a result, the credit quality of                                                       1  Different market organizations and lenders define leveraged loans in different ways; however there are two broad ways to classify loans as leveraged or nonleveraged. The first is based on credit ratings, and the second is based on a loan’s initial interest rate spread over LIBOR. The extent to which a credit is leveraged reflects, other things being equal, the leverage ratios of a borrower with higher ratios resulting in higher spreads or lower credit ratings. 2  EBITDA stands foe Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. 
BIS Review 121/2006 7 issuing companies has deteriorated. It cannot be excluded that certain features of the leveraged loan markets, such as debtor-friendly re-payment structures and an increasing tendency by lenders to accept breaches of loan covenants, could have contributed to a perpetuation of the benign credit cycle, while at the same time increasing the risk of clusters of defaults in the event that liquidity conditions deteriorate.    Because of the high yields they offer, leveraged loans have become popular assets for inclusion in complex structured credit derivatives products and the riskiest parts of them are often sold to hedge funds. Disturbances in the leveraged loan market could therefore also trigger spill-over effects via the aforementioned “triangle”.   
8 BIS Review 121/2006 Looking ahead, rapidly rising leverage, the increasing recourse to short-term funding and the surging interest payment burden have left firms’ balance sheets vulnerable to adverse disturbances. [see slide 9] Although the increase in euro area corporate sector leverage should be considered in conjunction with the continued strength of profitability, it seems nevertheless to have contributed to deterioration in some yardsticks of credit quality. These include a higher proportion of rating agency downgrade actions than upgrades and a rising number of firms being placed on review for a rating downgrade vis-à-vis firms facing a possible rating upgrade. This seems to be at least partly related to the aforementioned growing LBO, as well as share buyback, activity both of which can weaken the position of existing corporate debt holders and increase the affected firms’ vulnerability to changes in financing conditions. A significant deterioration in corporate sector credit quality would not only imply greater loan losses for banks, but could also trigger an asset price adjustment in credit markets, especially if the frequency of unexpected idiosyncratic corporate defaults were to rise.  Euro area household sector leverage has reached unprecedented heights. Thus, past experience is not relevant for assessing its sustainability. Although household sector debt ratios in the euro area on average have remained lower than those in other mature economies, risks are not evenly spread across the euro area. Indeed, there are continuing concerns regarding balance sheet vulnerabilities in countries where debt-ratios are well above the euro area average, especially if debt is predominantly financed at variable interest rates. [see chart on the left of slide 10] Regarding risks to household income, survey evidence reveals that euro area households have become less pessimistic concerning their future employment prospects but have remained pessimistic about their financial outlook. [see chart on the right of slide 10] All in all, however, considering the outlook for economic growth, the likelihood of a decrease in household income in the near term is judged to be low. On the asset side of euro area household sector balance sheets, price-to-rent ratios in some countries suggest that a slowdown in the pace of future house price inflation, or even a correction, cannot be excluded. Banks in many Member States appear, by and large, to have carefully managed the risks inherent in the collateral used to secure mortgages, even though signs of intensifying competition may have led to a loosening of credit standards. This means that euro area households would probably have to bear the brunt of any property price reversal.    
BIS Review 121/2006 9 III.4  Euro area financial institutions  Turning to developments in the euro area banking sector, the analysis of the sector in this issue of the Review focuses on the performance of, and outlook for, a set of large and complex banking groups (LCBGs). The methodology used to identify these institutions, which is far more rigorous than the methods used in the past, is explained in detail in Special Feature A.  The latest data show that the financial condition of euro area LCBGs continued to improve in 2005 and the first half of 2006 consolidating the already steady improvement that had been underway since 2003. [see slide 11] The broad-based strengthening of profitability was driven by lending growth, which compensated for the further erosion in lending margins as a result of intense competition. Non-interest sources of income also contributed to bottom-line. At the same time, cost-containment continued and loan impairment charges declined further. Solvency ratios of euro area LCBGs remained comfortable despite declining slightly in the first half of 2006, which was due to a rise in risk-weighted assets. From a financial stability perspective, it is encouraging that those institutions with the lowest capital ratios in the past also improved in the first six months of 2006.  The assessment of credit risks is becoming complicated by recourse to CRT markets. For instance, the impact of a potential turn in the credit cycle on banks might be more muted than in earlier downturns, albeit not necessarily on other parts of the financial system since the risks themselves do not disappear. Other risks facing the banking sector mainly relate to interest rate risks, where the flat yield curve environment limits banks returns in their core business. There is a concern that this could encourage them to seek more risky ventures in an effort to boost profits, resulting in increased operational and counterparty risks from their growing exposure to unregulated financial institutions. Notwithstanding the risks identified, market analysts are expecting that the profitability of euro area LCBGs is likely to strengthen further in the short term, underpinned by a favourable economic outlook and benign credit conditions. [see slide 12]  Forward-looking market indicators for the credit risk of euro area LCBGs reflect this broadly positive assessment. For instance, the distance-to-default indicator continued to rise, including for the weakest banks. While this may reflect the low probability assigned by market participants to the materialisation of the risks and vulnerabilities identified by our analysis, it could also signify a favourable assessment of the shock-absorbing capacity of the banking system, supported by comfortable solvency ratios and improved risk management.  Euro area insurance firms have placed greater focus on risk management, risk-adjusted pricing and core profitability, all of which have continued to support a positive outlook for the sector, especially for 
10 BIS Review 121/2006 large firms. Ongoing improvements in asset liability management, together with an overall optimisation of the capital structure have underpinned a generally positive assessment by market participants, as witnessed by the recent moderate over-performance of the insurance index relative to the broad stock index. [see slide 13]    However, there are a number of risks facing the industry in the period ahead. For the non-life insurance sub-sector, increased competition is likely to weigh further on underwriting income, which could drive further consolidation within the sub-sector. For the life insurance sub-sector, ongoing 
BIS Review 121/2006 11 challenges include the closing of balance sheet mismatches in an environment of persistently low long-term interest rates and the effective management of longevity risk.  IV.  Overall assessment  Let me now turn to the overall assessment. [see slide 14] The central scenario for euro area financial stability remains broadly favourable. This is assessment is based on the following four factors:  First, the resilience of the system was confirmed by its ability to comfortably absorb some adverse disturbances;  Second, global economic activity is becoming more evenly balanced and the gradual shift to less accommodative monetary policies is proceeding smoothly; Third, the credit quality of the key counterparties of banks – households and firms – generally remains high and;  Fourth, euro area banks (LCBGs) are very profitable, their solvency ratios are comfortable and risk management continues to improve.  Nevertheless, some previously identified sources of risk and vulnerability have grown, and their relative likelihood could have changed. [see slide 15] First, a global source of medium-term risk for the stability of the financial system continues to be the large global financial imbalances, despite some rebalancing of global growth patterns and recent declines in oil prices.  Second, in global and euro area financial markets long-term yields and credit spreads remain very low, and thus vulnerable to a reappraisal of risk. At the same time, important risks may be developing – although they are extremely difficult to quantify – related to credit risk transfer markets in which hedge funds have become increasingly present.  Third, concerning sectoral risks in the euro area, there has been rapid re-leveraging in some parts of the corporate sector, induced in part by a surge in LBO activity, and household sector financial imbalances continue to grow and are especially sizeable in a number of countries.   
12 BIS Review 121/2006  For these reasons, the comforting central outlook for financial stability should not give rise to complacency because there are several possible low-probability but potentially high-impact events that could occur and that would, if they were to crystallise, create material risks for financial stability.  Thank you very much for your attention. 
Erkki Liikanen: Finland and EU  Speech by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the College of Europe, Warsaw, 8 December 2006. *      *      * On the evening of 9 May, 56 years ago, French and foreign newspapermen assembled at the Quai d'Orsay for the foreign minister's weekly press conference. Instead of the routine event which the journalists were expecting, the foreign minister, Robert Schuman read out in a "dull, hesitant" voice a two-page declaration that hit them like a bomb.  "It is no longer a time for vain words, but a bold, constructive act. France has acted, and the consequences of her action may be immense… She has acted essentially in the cause of peace. For peace to have a real chance, there first must be a Europe. Virtually five years to the day since Germany surrendered unconditionally, France has made the first decisive step towards building Europe hand-in-hand with Germany". This was how Schuman started his speech, which culminated in the proposal to set up the Coal and Steed Community.  Schuman wanted to bring the raw materials of war under the umbrella of a Coal and Steel Community. This Community was to be the first step towards creating a European federation, which was indispensable for safeguarding peace. And Schuman made this point explicitly: "The solidarity in production thus established will make it plain that any war between France and Germany becomes not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible".  France's initiative received considerable attention in various parts of Europe. The Finnish embassy in Paris did not notify Helsinki of the May initiative until September, by which time the negotiations on setting up the Coal and Steel Community were well advanced.  The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community was finally signed in April 1951. And six years later it was on much the same basis that the European Economic Community or EEC was built.  Robert Schuman became prime minister of France in 1947, by which time J.K. Paasikivi had taken up office as President. Schuman's government lasted only a year, after which he was minister of foreign affairs in eight successive governments.  Paasikivi and Schuman steered their respective countries' foreign policies in the late 1940s and early 1950s, although Paasikivi did so longer and from a stronger position.  Finland and France's political agendas differed dramatically from each other. Paasikivi's concern was how to develop a relationship of trust with the Soviet Union while safeguarding his country's position as a democratic market economy. Schuman's big problem, on the other hand, was Germany: how to operate so that war between Germany and France would be permanently ruled out. On the domestic political scene both men were anxious to prevent the Communists from gaining too strong a position.  The author of Schuman's initiative was Jean Monnet, a cosmopolitan Frenchman, who headed his country's Planning Commissariat.  Finnish autonomy in the debate over Alsace-Lorraine  There are, however, similarities between Schuman's and Paasikivi's respective careers and outlooks. Schuman was a native of Alsace-Lorraine, which was part of Germany up to the time of the First World War. He attended school in Metz and studied law in Munich and Berlin. Naturally Schuman was well acquainted with Germany and even served as a clerk in the German army during the war.  Paasikivi was an influential figure in Finland when it was an autonomous Grand Duchy within the Russian Empire. He was renowned as an expert on Russia. He began his studies specializing in Russian language and literature and even spent half a year in Novgorod. Later on he too was to end up as a lawyer.  In the 1910s there was serious controversy in Alsace-Lorraine over the relationship with Germany. Political opinion was sharply divided. One group wanted the region to be a fully-fledged German state, whereas the other group aspired to a return to the French sphere. They wanted to see an autonomous BIS Review 120/2006 1 
Alsace-Lorraine with its own constitution and government independent of the Bundesrat. Interestingly enough, the example of Finnish autonomy within the Russian Empire was occasionally brought up in the debate as a sort of yardstick.  Cognac entrepreneur Monnet  Jean Monnet's origin was in the region of Cognac. It was in fact Jean Monnet's father who made Monnet a brand name in 1901. The cases of cognac were dispatched from the Monnet business to Berlin, New York, St. Petersburg and London.  The thought of the world awaiting these packages fired the young Monnet's imagination. The restless schoolboy eventually left school at the age of 16 and set off into the wide world. He first spent two years in London, from where he made for Canada and then continued on to the United States. By the age of 20 he had already seen a fair amount of the world.  Monnet returned home to Cognac just before the First World War and began working in the family business. He was exempted from military service on account of a lung condition.  However, Monnet's mind was constantly on the bigger issues of war and peace. He was perturbed that the Allied purchasing and supply organization was so badly run, having observed the lack of cooperation between France and England in this area.  Monnet managed to get to speak to the French prime minister and put his ideas to him. This unknown 26-year-old son of a Cognac dealer made a profound impression on the prime minister. He sent Monnet to talk with the minister for war and before long Monnet was in London putting together the Allied combined supply organization.  Monnet came to occupy a key position in Anglo-French cooperation arrangements. With this as his background, in 1919 - when he was still only 31 - he became Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Nations. But just a few years later bad news from Cognac began to filter through. The market had collapsed and Monnet's sister made a special visit to Geneva to beg her brother to return and look after the family business.  Monnet did not hesitate for a moment and much to his colleagues' astonishment he went back at the age of 36 to head the family cognac business. By this time, in 1924, Paasikivi had already been chairman of the private bank, Kansallis-Osake Pankki, for ten years and he was to remain there for a further ten. Meanwhile in 1919 Schuman had become a member of parliament in the French National Assembly, where he was to remain in that capacity without a break until 1940.  Once he had put the cognac business back in order, Monnet did not stay for long. He also got involved in the world of banking. He began working for an American investment bank in Paris. In 1927 he headed the zloty stabilization negotiations in Warsaw. In 1929 he moved to the United States and pursued a banking career in San Francisco.  Monnet later summed up his time in San Francisco, which ended in 1932, in the following words: "In San Francisco, I made and then lost a great deal of money; experience was all I added to my capital." At the same time the family received some good news. J.G. Monnet had a new client, for in that same year the Finnish State alcohol monopoly, ALKO, began buying cognac from the Monnets.  Monnet switched continents to become an investment banker in Shanghai, China, where he was involved in devising a way of financing the enormous railway network.  Although of limited professional interest, Monnet's Moscow contacts were altogether more rewarding from a personal point of view. In 1929 he had fallen in love with an Italian lady at a dinner party in Paris. But the lady also had a husband on the scene and it was not possible for Catholics to get divorced. Eventually after some rather intricate manoeuvring Monnet traveled with his beloved Silvia to Moscow, where Catholic marriages were not recognized. They got married there in 1934 with the assistance of the Russian authorities.  At the same time J. K. Paasikivi retired from the post of chairman of the Kansallis-Osake Pankki. It was not until six years later that he was sent to Moscow to become ambassador together with his wife Alli. In contrast Robert Schuman remained unmarried for his whole life.  2 BIS Review 120/2006 
Outsiders on the inside  In 1936 Monnet returned to Washington, where his family lived until the end of the war. He developed an extensive network of contacts in the city. He was a friend of leading newspaperman Walter Lippman, and John Foster Dulles was the lawyer who worked on many of Monnet's banking operations.  Monnet was an influential figure in President Roosevelt's close circle. It would only be a slight exaggeration to say of him what Max Jakobson said of Paasikivi's position during the war: that he was a sort of "outsider on the inside". In any case, it was an exceptional position for a Frenchman to be in.  When war broke out, member of parliament, Robert Schuman was involved in the evacuation of his constituency of Thionville. In 1940 he was appointed France's under-secretary of state for refugee affairs. He was the high-ranking government official first to be notified of the massive German offensive in May 1940. The French government was transferred to Vichy and Schuman with it. But when all constitutional powers were conferred on Marshal Petain by decision of the National Assembly, Schuman realized that he had been caught in a trap.  Schuman left Vichy and returned to his constituency in August 1940. There he was soon to be arrested by the Germans and was dispatched to Germany. He managed to escape two years later and lived out the war in the Underground movement in France.  Paasikivi was ambassador in Moscow from April 1940 until the end of June 1941, although in fact he was already back in Finland by March. He did not live in "internal exile", as was sometimes claimed, but kept up extensive contacts with the political and economic leadership of Finland during the war.  Monnet, on the other hand, was involved in a variety of international operations during the war, with the confident backing of President Roosevelt. I shall relate just one historic episode from Monnet's wartime activities.  In July 1940 the French government was wavering between continuing the war and ceasing hostilities. Monnet was in London at the time, doing his utmost to encourage the French government to continue the war. De Gaulle too had already settled in London. Monnet proposed that the British government should do something dramatic to galvanize the French government. The proposal was to create a close union between England and France. The union would have a common currency, it would form a customs union and its nationals would have common citizenship rights.  Winston Churchill hesitated, but nonetheless forwarded the proposal for his government to discuss. To his surprise, the government received the proposal enthusiastically and approved it on 14 July 1940.  Charles de Gaulle did likewise and became a historic figure the very next day with the speech he made on the BBC. De Gaulle did not like the federal tone of Monnet's text, but being a pragmatist he understood that needs must steer where the devil drives.  The reaction in France was one of astonishment. It was quite simply not possible to put up a roof before the walls of the house were built. It was, however, hoped that this would give the French prime minister some extra time. But it was not to be. Petain came to power and began to negotiate an armistice with Germany. France was lost.  National sovereignty and raison d'etat as problems  Monnet discussed the need for European integration on several occasions during the war. He was not an idealistic federalist, but above all a practical man.  At the League of Nations Monnet had been disappointed in the organization's failure to act in practice. He was convinced that mutual dependence between nations was a fact of life and that rampant nationalism was the main cause of war. Monnet was convinced that political stability and economic prosperity in Europe called for the creation of a common free trade area. But it was not enough just to do away with Customs duties, since union was necessary in other areas too. His list included currency, prices, industrial and agricultural production and communications.  Monnet stressed that there could be no peace in Europe, if states continued to be structured around the sort of national sovereignty that leads to the politics of privilege and economic protectionism. If the states of Europe again cut themselves off from each other, it would again be necessary to amass huge armies. And before long we would be back at war.  BIS Review 120/2006 3 
Coincidentally, in the summer of 1944 Paasikivi was discussing the fate of small countries. His reading of history had made him a pessimist: "States act for raison d'etat, i.e. in the interests of the State. It is frightful, blood-red". He went on: "To date no system has been devised that would constrain raison d'etat and protect other countries from them."  Where Monnet spoke of nationalism and national sovereignty, Paasikivi wrote about raison d'etat. Ultimately, they were both talking about the same thing. Paasikivi saw the key issue as how to limit raison d'etat, whereas Monnet saw the basic problem as how to limit national sovereignty. Paasikivi's starting point was the lot of the small country, but his thinking went further than this: "Solving the problem of limiting raison d'etat and its relationship to morality is an issue that, although primarily affecting the future of small countries, will ultimately also determine the future of larger countries and the whole of mankind."  History had made Paasikivi not only pessimistic, but also cautious. When Monnet was accused of being over-optimistic in connection with his numerous initiatives, he always replied: "I am not an optimist, I am determined".  For his part, Schuman summarized his own thinking in his unpublished memoirs: "The harsh lessons of history have taught me, as a man from a border area, that I should be wary of hasty improvisation and over-ambitious projects, but they have also taught me that when an objective judgment, founded in mature reflection and based on actual facts and the overriding interests of mankind, leads us into new or even revolutionary endeavors, we should remain steadfast and persevere with them."  The birth of a great idea  The paths of the cautious foreign minister from Alsace-Lorraine, Robert Schuman, and the bold man of action, Jean Monnet, crossed in the post-war years. In February 1950 Monnet went on a two-week cross-country skiing trip in the Alps. Although having a guide to mark out the ski route, Monnet was on his own in blazing the conceptual trail that led to the pioneering thoughts he put down on paper each evening.  By the time he returned his proposal was ready: France should take the initiative on setting up a coal and steel union. This would resolve the difficult dispute over the management of coal and steel and normalize relations between France and Germany.  Another statesman also had his best ideas while out skiing and jogging, our president after Paasikivi, namely Urho Kekkonen.1  In March 1950, Monnet began indirectly conveying his ideas to Schuman and eventually at the end of April he presented his complete plan. On May Day Schuman sent a message to Monnet: "I've read the proposal. I'll make it my own".  The core of Schuman's initiative was that the member States would agree to pool their national sovereignty in the area of coal and steel under the umbrella of a community. The community was to be run by a High Authority (the forerunner of the European Commission) that would be independent of the member countries' governments. The Community would be set up on the basis of a Treaty to be ratified by the parliaments of the member countries. Schuman thought it important that the make-up of the High Authority should ensure balance between the smaller and larger countries.  Schuman's initiative was enthusiastically welcomed by the public. The reaction in the political world was more mixed. It cleared up many issues for Germany and Adenauer. The Christian Democrats supported the plan unreservedly. The opposition Social Democrat party conference was against it. Only one young little-known Member of Parliament spoke out strongly in support of the plan. His name was Willy Brandt.  It was not an easy ride in France. The centre, which Schuman represented, and the Socialists supported the plan. The Communists were against it, as were the Gaullists, since they did not approve of transferring national sovereignty to a High Authority. The reaction in Italy was immediately positive. In the Benelux countries it took somewhat longer for the idea to become established. Britain's negative stance hardly came as a surprise.                                                        1 President of Finland 1956–82. 4 BIS Review 120/2006 
Schuman entrusted Monnet with the task of leading the negotiations on establishing the Community, which was also given an Assembly and a Court. The Assembly was to monitor the High Authority and the Court of Justice was to supervise the implementation of the Treaty.  However, as so often happens, at the political level and for the then foreign minister, Schuman, there was still some tricky negotiating to be done: decisions had to be reached on where the Community's headquarters were to be based, the official language and the composition of the High Authority.  The compromise that was negotiated by Schuman is now standard Community practice: instead of just French, as had been proposed, the languages of all the member countries were made official languages and the headquarters were split in two. The Assembly went to Strasbourg and the High Authority and Court of Justice to Luxembourg. The Treaty finally came into force in July 1952 and the High Authority opened for business in Luxembourg a month later with Jean Monnet as its President.  At the same time Schuman's position as France's foreign minister was under threat. He was particularly targeted by the Gaullists and the Radicals because of his policy on Europe. Pinay's government eventually fell in December 1952. The formal reason was budget controversy, but behind this there were also disagreements over European policy.  Schuman stepped down as foreign minister in January 1953. He offered to give up his post so that he could support Rene Meyer, who represented the same policy on Europe, as the choice for prime minister. That was the last time Schuman was to serve in a French government.  "An intelligent and charming guest in Finland"  Several weeks later the Finnish Foreign Trade Association was trying to find a speaker to its meeting. Heikki Brotherus, the press counselor to the embassy in Paris, knew Schuman, since he had met him at Quaker functions. And now that Schuman had left the government, Brotherus thought that he would be an ideal candidate.  The leadership of the Foreign Trade Association were delighted. But then the difficulties began. Brotherus received a letter from Mr Tarjanne, permanent secretary of Foreign Ministry, accusing him of arbitrary conduct. Brotherus responded to the charge in writing. Everyone knew about the affair, except the ambassador, Johan Helo. But that was how many things were dealt with at the embassy in Paris at the time. Helo had been appointed ambassador in the new wave after the war as one of the so-called Six.2 Helo's relations with the foreign minister were difficult, but Paasikivi protected Helo right until the end of his period of office.  According to Brotherus, the foreign minister even went as far as asking the French ambassador in Helsinki to cancel Schuman's planned visit to Finland. Paasikivi does state in his diaries that the foreign minister, Törngren, said on 24 March, in connection with his weekly visit, that the Foreign Trade Association wanted to make a big event out of Schuman's visit, but that the government was not interested in organizing any dinner reception or in devoting any other particular attention to Schuman. Despite the awkwardness of the arrangements, Schuman came to Finland on a visit in April, three months after he had left the government. Schuman's visit was given enormous coverage in the press.  In his presentation Schuman stressed that all wars had had their beginnings in precisely six states. "By defusing this hotbed of war, we have done something really fundamental for peace in Europe," he stated.  The government did not in fact organize a dinner or devote any particular attention to Schuman, unless one counts the supper invitation by social affairs minister, Vaino Leskinen, at the Helsinki community hall, where Schuman was to meet some trade union people.  President Paasikivi was, however, present at Schuman's presentation and also had an audience with him. Paasikivi wrote in his diaries about the pleasant impression Schuman had made on him. Schuman believed that the antagonism between France and Germany would gradually be removed and that the Coal and Steel Community would be a step towards this. Paasikivi went on: "I explained                                                       2  The Six is the name given to an opposition group of Social Democrats who left the party and allied themselves with the Communists in the elections after the war. BIS Review 120/2006 5 
my own view and the position of Finland. He understood it well. Schuman is indeed an intelligent and charming man".  It was typical of the period that Pravda reported on the visit a week later. According to Pravda, Schuman's visit was undeniably connected with the discussions, which the right-wing socialists had launched, against stepping up trade between Finland and the Soviet Union. So Leskinen did not escape criticism. The article had been put together by Stefan Smirnov, a great expert on Finland.  Jean Monnet never met Paasikivi. However, in October 1962 in connection with President Kekkonen's visit to France the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat wrote a one-column news-in-brief item on Kekkonen's meeting with the "father of Europe". The item said that the President had visited Carré's house outside Paris.  Louis Carré was a distinguished Parisian gallery-owner and prominent admirer of Alvar Aalto, the Finnish architect. Aalto had, in fact designed Carré's home. Carré was a neighbour of Monnet's, which is why Monnet was also invited to meet the important guest.  According to the newspaper, despite being 74, "Mr Europe" came across as being extremely alert and sprightly. Monnet and Kekkonen had a long talk in English, although the newspaper did not report about its content.  President Kekkonen was visiting France, at that time, upon the invitation of President Charles de Gaulle. This was a time when de Gaulle and Monnet were in deep disagreement over European issues. President de Gaulle considered national sovereignty untouchable while Monnet considered its limitation to be the key to European integration. Monnet believed that independent European institutions were the corner-stone of Europe, de Gaulle was, on the other hand, a strong opponent of their independence.  So President Kekkonen had an opportunity to hear both views. Unfortunately, we have no records about his discussions with Jean Monnet.  Finland's long road  Europe managed to fit in a lot between Paasikivi's meeting with Schuman and Kekkonen's meeting with Monnet. France's plan for a European Defence Community (the EDC) had collapsed under opposition from the French National Assembly. However, at the instigation of the Benelux countries negotiations were launched on setting up a European Economic Community (the EEC).  The negotiations culminated in the conclusion of the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Under the terms of this Treaty the member states pooled their national sovereignties together in certain clearly defined areas, namely customs policy, trade policy, competition policy and agricultural policy. The bottom line for the states that founded the EEC was that together the countries of Europe would be greater and stronger than alone. With Community backing the member states would derive economic and political 'value added' which they could not achieve individually.  Finland was far away from all of this. The Soviet Union saw the EEC as a western alliance and not as a partner. Finland had little room for manoeuvre and every move was closely scrutinized and watched. In Finland European integration was little known – if at all.  * * * Finland had a long road to go until, in 1992, our country applied membership in the European Union.  A turning point came in 1991, which altered the basic issue of how to reconcile Finnish foreign policy with EU membership. At that time the whole context, in which our foreign policy operated, turned upside down. The "putsch" in Moscow did not succeed. The Baltic States became independent. A new agreement was negotiated redefining Finland's relations with its neighbour Russia. The EU went from being a threat to Russia to becoming a partner.  Today, Finland has been 12 years a member of the EU. Finland is having the EU presidency for the second time.  This week the Finnish Parliament has ratified the constitutional treaty. The constitutional treaty does not give new powers to the Union, but sets out to improve its efficiency and openness. Streamlining decision-making procedures is the best way of protecting the EU institutions' effectiveness.  6 BIS Review 120/2006 
It the EU, the guiding principle is law – not force. Legitimacy and the rule of law govern relations between the member states. The task of the Commission as the guardian of the treaty is to monitor the legality of all activities and compliance with the treaties on which the EU is based. The Independent European Court of Justice solves the disputes which concern legality of the actions.  EU is non-hegemonic and it must be efficient in decision-making. There have been efforts to unite Europe under one hegemony. They have created huge sacrifices and destruction. To be non-hegemonic, you need a majority decision-making. No one country can rule or dominate and no one country can prevent the majority from making a decision, not a big, not a small, not an old, not a new. Only a qualified majority as the dominant decision making procedure guarantees this.  We must safeguard the European Union's capacity to act in the spirit of the founding fathers.

Jean-Claude Trichet: Testimony at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament Testimony by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 20 December 2006. *      *      * Madame la présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission économique et monétaire, je me réjouis de paraître devant votre Commission aujourd’hui et de poursuivre ainsi notre dialogue régulier. Je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire. Anschließend möchte ich auf zwei Themen näher eingehen: Erstens, auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Produktivität, Potentialwachstum and Geldpolitik. Zweitens, auf das Geldmengenwachstum in verschiedenen Abgrenzungen und dessen Einfluss auf das Preisgeschehen. Economic and monetary issues At the time of my previous appearance before the European Parliament in October, I described how the data then available had served to confirm our assessment that economic growth in the euro area was becoming more broadly based and increasingly supported by domestic demand. In addition, the cross-checking of our economic and monetary analyses underlined the existence of upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. In order to contain such upside risks to price stability and preserve the firm anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations, on 7 December the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. Let me explain the assessment underlying this decision and the outlook for the economy and risks to price stability. Starting with the economic analysis, the main indicators of economic activity that have become available over the past few months confirm the Governing Council’s assessment that economic activity has continued to expand robustly, albeit moderating somewhat from the very strong rates seen in the first half of the year. According to Eurostat’s first estimate, the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of real GDP in the euro area for the third quarter of 2006 was 0.5%, driven mainly by domestic demand. This confirms the anticipated broadening of the recovery and points to the increasingly self-sustaining nature of economic expansion in the euro area. This assessment is also in line with available information for the fourth quarter. Looking ahead to next year, the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow solidly at rates around potential, with some volatility in the quarterly growth rates likely to emerge around the turn of the year on account of the impact of changes in indirect taxes in a large euro area country. Overall, global growth has become geographically more balanced and remains robust, providing support for euro area exports. Investment is expected to remain dynamic, benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions, balance sheet restructuring, accumulated and ongoing strong earnings, and gains in business efficiency. Consumption should also strengthen further over time as employment conditions continue to improve. This outlook for economic developments is reflected in the new Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections (2.5 % to 2.9 % in 2006, 1.7 % to 2.7 % in 2007, 1.8 % to 2.8 % in 2008) and is also in line with recent forecasts made by international organisations.  The risks surrounding the outlook of sustained economic growth close to potential lie on the downside and relate mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices, fears of a rise in protectionist pressures, and concerns about possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances.  Turning to the price developments, annual HICP inflation rose to 1.9% in November 2006, from 1.6% in October. The lower annual HICP inflation rates recorded in the previous months mainly reflected the significant declines in crude oil prices from August onwards, as well as base effects. While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain, overall inflation rates are likely to increase again in early 2007 and then hover around 2% in the course of that year and in 2008, also reflecting the impact of higher indirect taxes. The Eurosystem staff projections point to a rate of inflation of 2.1 % to 2.3 % in 2006, 1.5 % to 2.5 % in 2007 and 1.3 % to 2.5 % in 2008.  BIS Review 126/2006 1 
This outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks, stemming in particular from a stronger than expected pass-through of previous oil price increases, as well as the possibility of renewed oil price increases and of additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the positive signs from labour markets, wage developments could be stronger than currently expected. Turning to developments in the monetary aggregates and credit, annual M3 growth was unchanged at 8.5% in October, remaining close to the highest rates observed since the introduction of the euro. Increasing interest rates have exerted some influence over monetary developments in recent months, although as yet mainly by triggering shifts among the components of M3 rather than constraining the expansion of M3 itself.  Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion, identified by the ECB’s monetary analysis since mid-2004. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, annual inflation rates are projected to hover around 2% in the coming two years, with risks to this outlook remaining on the upside. In addition, given the ongoing strength of monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to long term.  As I said on December 7, our decision to increase key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points on 7 December contributes to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, which is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Indeed, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. The Governing Council will therefore monitor very closely all developments so that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. As regards fiscal policy, the Commission’s autumn forecasts point to improving fiscal balances, but this can only partly be attributed to progress in structural consolidation, as higher economic growth and revenue windfalls are playing an important role. Moreover, in a number of countries with fiscal imbalances, adjustment efforts still fall short of what is needed to meet their respective medium-term objectives in a timely manner. It is therefore crucial that forthcoming updates of the stability programmes make sufficient headway towards safe budgetary positions in the countries concerned. For all countries it is paramount that pro-cyclical policies be avoided in the current economic upswing.  Productivity, growth potential and monetary policy Over the last fifteen years the euro area has witnessed an almost steady deceleration in the growth rate of labour productivity. This deceleration can be explained by underlying developments, some of which are welcome, whereas others are less favourable. First, it is the effect of some welcome progress in labour market reforms and wage moderation over the last decade. Although it is seldom stressed in public discourses, these measures have contributed to remarkable results. Over the last eight years (the period in which the single monetary policy has been in place), employment has risen by 9.2 percentage points and the unemployment rate has declined by 1.9 percentage points. Let me also stress that if I compare the 8 years after the euro was set up with the 8 years before the euro, we created 11.73 million jobs after the euro and only 2.65 million jobs before the euro. Second, and less welcome, the decline in productivity is partly the result of capital investments not keeping up with the pace of job creation. The still existing rigidities in product and labour markets that impair effective competition and flexibility, and more generally the presence of regulatory restraints on business, have prevented firms from investing more strongly in the adoption of new information and communication technologies, which could be effective tools to reduce costs and improve productivity. Ultimately, the growth rate of the actively working population and the pace at which technological progress is implemented in the production process are the critical determinants of the growth rate of 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
potential output. It is extremely important, especially at this juncture, to strengthen the reforms aimed at increasing employment, fostering competition in the product markets and creating an environment favourable to the development and implementation of new concepts and technologies. All individuals need to have the opportunity to get appropriate training. In a knowledge economy the wealth and prosperity of European citizens depend on their education, training and skills and the extent to which these skills can flourish in a flexible economy open to innovation and change. There are sometimes calls upon the central bank for more expansionary monetary policy as an incentive to increase productivity. I shall make two points on this. First, monetary policy cannot enhance the trend growth rate of productivity and potential output. A loose monetary policy would just create high inflation and inject volatility into the economy. On the contrary, a monetary policy geared to delivering low and stable inflation contributes to creating a favourable macroeconomic environment for employment creation and investment decisions. Price stability reduces interest rate premia, and thus the cost of capital, and allows wage and price-setters to focus on productivity, costs and competitive factors, rather than wasting resources on protecting themselves against uncertainty about future inflation. Second, the negative productivity developments I have just discussed have not only been a drag on economic activity, they have also put significant temporary upward pressure on inflation, especially after 2001. The increase of unit labour costs due to mediocre productivity, combined with other supply shocks such as oil price increases, have contributed to a level of inflation over the threshold of our definition of price stability of less than 2%. Had we not had a highly credible monetary policy, we would not have been able to anchor solidly medium and long-term inflationary expectations in the euro area and we would have had to pay a significant price in terms of growth and job creation.  Developments in monetary aggregates and their impact on inflation Let me now turn to the important role played by the monetary analysis in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy and interest rate decisions. As you know, we are cross-checking the results of our economic analysis with those of our monetary analysis. Allow me to recall that the strong long-term relationship between monetary growth and inflation is one of the best documented empirical findings in economic literature. Many studies have documented this relationship in the euro area, demonstrating that it is particularly close over longer horizons. I will add that the national currencies that had the highest level of credibility prior to the introduction of the euro and against which the Euro has been benchmarked, all relied on a monetary policy framework embodying a role for monetary analysis. Given the ECB’s mandate to maintain price stability, the necessarily medium-term orientation of its strategy to do so and the continuity between the most credible national currencies and the Euro, assigning an important role to the analysis of monetary developments is both necessary and very useful. The monetary pillar of the ECB’s monetary policy concept has contributed importantly to the success of our monetary policy and to the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.  In recent years, money has grown strongly while, at the same time, inflation developments have remained under control. This begs the question of how the ECB has interpreted strong monetary growth. The ECB has always emphasised the broad-based nature of its monetary analysis. In order to distil the policy-relevant “signal” about risks to price stability from the monetary data, the inevitable “noise” in shorter-term movements needs to be identified and removed. To do so, the ECB employs a variety of instruments, such as analysis of the components and counterparts of money, and other economic and financial data as necessary, as well as statistical and econometric models.  The practical side of this signal extraction problem in the euro area can be illustrated by the experience between 2001 and 2003. Financial and geopolitical uncertainty at that time triggered portfolio shifts into safe and liquid monetary assets. Since these shifts reflected portfolio behaviour rather than an accumulation of transaction balances, the ensuing strong monetary expansion was assessed by the Governing Council not to pose risks to price stability under the prevailing economic conditions. On this basis, strong monetary growth of the M3 measure during that period was analysed as relatively benign in terms of inflationary risks, in line with the information extracted from the economic analysis.  This example illustrates how the ECB has eschewed a mechanical interpretation of the development of M3. Rather, the ECB has sought to explain monetary developments in a comprehensive manner, extract from these developments the policy-relevant signal about the medium to long-term outlook for inflation, and set interest rates in a manner that addresses the risks to price stability revealed by this analysis as well as by the complementary economic analysis. BIS Review 126/2006 3 
Since mid-2004, monetary growth in the euro area has been of a different nature to that observed between 2001 and 2003. In particular, the strengthening of M3 growth has been driven by the low level of interest rates rather than portfolio shifts into money. This has been reflected in the strong contribution that the most liquid components, such as currency and overnight deposits, have made to M3 growth. Moreover, strong money growth has been primarily driven by a rapid expansion of loans to the private sector, underpinned by the economic recovery. Taking the appropriate medium- to longer-term perspective, the continued expansion of money and credit through the course of 2005 gave an intensifying indication of increasing risks to price stability, fully in line with the results of our economic analysis, and vindicating our orientation to progressively increase interest rates by 150 basis points from December 2005 onwards. I thank you for your attention. 4 BIS Review 126/2006 
Y V Reddy: Dynamics of balance of payments in India Text of the First Diamond Jubilee Lecture delivered by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, at the Inauguration of the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations of the Department of Commerce, Osmania University, Hyderabad, 16 December 2006. *      *      * Vice-Chancellor Professor Siddiqi, Prof. J. Satyanarayana, Dr. J. Rameshwar Rao, Prof. Purushotham Rao, Prof. Ali Khan, faculty members and distinguished friends,  I am honoured by the kind invitation of the Vice-Chancellor to me to be the Chief Guest and to deliver the first Diamond Jubilee lecture of the Department of Commerce, Osmania University. I specifically owe a deep debt of gratitude to Osmania University and I have also been proud to acknowledge it. In August 1960, Prof. V. V. Ramanadham consented to be my guide for Ph.D. after a grueling test of an essay on competition, thus making the beginning of my association with the University. I joined the University as a full-time research scholar and continued with the research work. I was initiated in to the intricacies and joy of research in applied economics by the faculty of the Department of Commerce, specially through the Weekly Seminars in Applied Economics. My first seminar participation was in February 1962 on monopoly power in India. In these seminars, the participants used to include the distinguished civil servants, academicians, businessmen, etc. It also included Mr. B.P.R. Vithal, a highly respected civil servant who was, at that time, the Registrar of the University and has subsequently become my esteemed ‘Guru’. The two earliest research articles published by me were in the quarterly journal "Applied Economics Papers"; one of them as a co-author, with this publication having a globally distinguished editorial board. During this period in the University, I came into contact with eminent persons like Dr. I.G. Patel, later Governor, Reserve Bank of India and Mr. S. S. Khera, Cabinet Secretary. Subsequently, since Prof. Ramanadham had by then left for the United Nations, I had the good fortune of being guided by Prof. G. Ram Reddy and Prof. J. Satyanarayana, which enabled me to complete my Ph.D.  As some of you may know, I had a second spell in the Osmania University in the academic year 1985-86 when I came back here as a full time UGC Visiting Professor in the Department of Business Management, on deputation from the Government of Andhra Pradesh, where I was a Secretary to the Government. In fact, Prof. Raghuram had then commented that my spirit had been hovering around here and that I had never left the University. This stint provided me a break to sit back, contemplate and review my understanding of the Indian economy. It is this campus, which actually gave me an inspiration to revisit the relative roles of the State and market in India. This permeated not only my subsequent academic work in the Administrative Staff College of India as well as the London School of Economics, but also my participation in the exciting adventure of economic reforms, particularly the external sector reforms since 1991. In the 15 years of reforms, we have moved away from crisis management in the external sector to a confident conduct of public policy. It is, therefore, useful to review our experience in this regard particularly since commerce is now a lot more globalised than ever before and is likely to become even more internationalised in future. I intend presenting before you the dynamics of balance of payment in India since independence and will conclude with a few remarks on the way forward. Normally, I do not take recourse to detailed tables, charts, etc., but in this case, I will be using several tables. I am doing it as a tribute to Prof. Ramanadham who always insisted that there should not be a single superfluous word and every sentence should emanate from solid data presented with specific objectives, scope, limits and methodology. In a way, therefore, my address today is dedicated to Prof. Ramanadham.  At the time of independence, higher imports and capital outflows, led by partition, resulted in significant deficit in the balance of payments necessitating running down of the accumulated sterling balances. As the country embarked upon the planned development in the fifties, rapid industrialisation of the country through development of basic and heavy industries guided the industrial and trade policies during the First (1951-56) and the Second (1956-61) Five-Year Plans. 'Import substitution' was recognised as the appropriate strategy for rapid industrialisation.  Export pessimism permeated the policy stance throughout the early decades of our Planning. This thinking was based on the four premises, which were considered appropriate at that time. First, it was believed that only after industrialisation had proceeded some way that increased production would be BIS Review 126/2006 1 
reflected in larger export earnings. Secondly, it was argued that given the large domestic market, exports need not be an engine of growth. Thirdly, growth in external demand for India's products was likely to be inelastic because of the traditional nature of our exports. Finally, there was what was known as the Prebisch-Singer argument that primary commodity exports face a secular deterioration in the terms of trade. Accordingly, exports were regarded as a residual, a vent-for-surplus on those occasions when such surpluses were available. The inward looking industrialisation strategy during the first three Plans resulted in higher rate of industrial growth. However, the signs of strain in the balance of payments were clearly visible in the Second Plan (see Table 1 attached for trends in India's current account). As the import demand surged on account of development of heavy industries, current account deficit (CAD) in the Second Plan surged to 2.3 per cent of GDP. The difficulties in financing fast growing imports with stagnant exports put considerable strain on reserves as import cover of reserves (or foreign currency assets) plunged to barely two months’ by the terminal year of the Second Plan. In the Third Plan, improved export performance and slowdown in import demand led to some improvement in CAD and at the same time the financing requirements were met through stepping up of official assistance.  The Third Plan reflected the first signs of rethinking in the policy strategy by dedicating itself to ‘self sustaining growth’, which required ‘domestic saving to progressively meet the demand of investment and for the balance of payment gap to be bridged over’. While it envisaged that normal capital flows will continue, it set out the early indications of the concept of self reliance by foreseeing a steady reduction in the reliance on special foreign aid programmes and dispensing with them after a period of time. A more liberal view of self reliance evolved over the Third Plan with a shift in stress from 'import substitution' to policy emphasis on 'efficient substitution of imports'. However, in reality, until the end of the 1970s, exports were primarily regarded as a source of foreign exchange rather than an efficient means of resource allocation. Though the devaluation of 1966 brought to the fore the problems associated with the overvalued exchange rate, it did not bring immediate desired improvement in the balance of payments position. In fact, CAD-GDP ratio widened to 2.0 per cent during the Annual Plans (1966-69).  Unlike the export pessimism of the earlier Plans, the Fourth Plan (1969-74) visualised an aggressive approach to export growth for achieving self reliance. As a consequence, trade policy became the primary instrument for achieving a more dynamic concept of self reliance than what was prevalent in the earlier decades. However, it was in the Fifth Plan (1974-79) that self reliance was recognised as an explicit objective. In the Fifth Plan, invisibles surfaced as an important element of the current account with policy attention on tourism and shipping. Discovering the remittances from Indian workers as a new source of meeting the growing financing needs, the period witnessed new confidence in the external sector and prepared the ground work for take off to the exchange rate regime based on a basket arrangement initiated since 1975. The fact remains that the phase till the 1970s represented the era of the dominance of external assistance as a financing instrument in balance of payments. (See Table 2 for net capital inflows to India). The second oil price shock was the precursor of another phase of strain on India's balance of payments. However, emergence of rising invisible surplus in India's balance of payments helped neutralise the widening trade deficit. Notwithstanding this, the CAD averaged 1.5 per cent of the GDP in the Sixth Plan. Against the backdrop of second oil shock, the decade of the 1980s brought the balance of payments position to the forefront of the macroeconomic management. The Sixth Plan (1980-85) emphasised the strengthening of the impulses of modernisation for the achievement of both economic and technological self reliance. The Seventh Plan (1985-90) noted the conditions under which the concept of self-reliance was defined earlier, particularly in the preceding Plan. It conceptualised self-reliance not merely in terms of reduced dependence on aid but also in terms of building up domestic capabilities and reducing import dependence in strategic materials. Achievement of technological competence through liberal imports of technology was also envisaged. Alongside, the winds of change were added by the recommendations of a number of committees set up during the late 1970s and the 1980s.  Some critical developments in India's balance of payments gathered momentum in the second half of the 1980s (i.e., Seventh Plan, 1985-90) that made the management of India's balance of payments the most challenging task. The Plan targeted to achieve a high growth rate and recognised that the management of balance of payments was critically dependent on a sizeable improvement in earnings from exports and from invisibles. It conceptualised self reliance not merely in terms of reduced dependence on aid but also in terms of building up domestic capabilities and reducing import dependence in strategic materials. However, several developments that put severe pressure on the 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
balance of payments position during the Plan need attention. First, the CAD assumed a structural character in the 1980s. With underlying expansion in economic activities, exports and imports grew in tandem, keeping the trade deficit at a high level. The invisible balance also deteriorated sharply due to stagnation in worker's remittances and rising interest burden due to building up of external debt. Second, with flows of external assistance falling short of the financing need, recourse to costly sources of finance in the form of external commercial borrowings (ECB), especially short term debt and non-resident deposits, became relatively large. Third, persistence of high fiscal deficit averaging 8.7 per cent of GDP (Centre and States) in the latter half of the 1980s, which could be only partly financed by the private sector surplus, thus, became a cause of deteriorating CAD. Fourth, higher reliance on monetary financing of deficits also led to rise in inflation to double digit in the early 1990s, adversely affecting the relative price competitiveness of India's exports. Some possible misalignment of exchange rate, thus, resulted in loss of export competitiveness of exports and bias towards imports.  The rising financing requirements described above required not only higher recourse to external debt but also draw down of reserves, which declined to US $ 4 billion by end-March 1990 from US $ 7.4 billion at end-March 1980. (See Table 3 for India's outstanding foreign exchange reserve position; and Tables 4 and 5 for components of external debt and India's external debt indicators, respectively). The weaknesses in the Indian economy were exposed by the Gulf crisis of 1990 and ensuing developments. The current account deficit rose to 3.1 per cent of GDP in 1990-91. Around the same time, credit rating of the country was lowered, restricting the country’s access to commercial borrowings and unwillingness on the part of normal banking channels to provide renewal of short-term credit to Indian banks abroad. As reserves kept on falling on expectations of an impending depreciation of Rupee, there was a temporary loss of confidence leading to a flight of Non Resident Indian (NRI) deposits.  The severity of the balance of payments crisis in the early 1990s could be gauged from the fact that India’s foreign currency assets depleted rapidly from US $ 3.1 billion in August 1990 to US $ 975 million on July 12, 1991. I must admit that I entered the policy circuit in Ministry of Finance, Government of India during this period. As a result of the crisis, a conscious decision was taken to honour all debt obligations without seeking any rescheduling and several steps were taken to tide over the crisis. The steps undertaken towards this objective included, among others, pledging our gold reserves, tightening of non-essential imports, accessing credit from the IMF and other multilateral and bilateral donors.  After the Gulf crisis in 1991, the broad framework for reforms in the external sector was laid out in the Report of the High Level Committee on Balance of Payments, popularly known as Rangarajan Committee, as it was chaired by Dr. C. Rangarajan, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India and currently Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister. After downward adjustment of the exchange rate in July 1991, following the recommendations of this Committee to move towards the market-determined exchange rate, we adopted the Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS) in March 1992 involving dual exchange rate system in the interim period. The LERMS was essentially a transitional mechanism and a downward adjustment in the official exchange rate took place in early December 1992 and ultimate convergence of the dual rates was made effective from March 1, 1993, leading to the introduction of a market-determined exchange rate regime. (See Table 6 for Movements of Indian rupee from 1993-94 to 2005-06). The unification of the exchange rate of the Indian rupee was an important step towards current account convertibility, which was finally achieved in August 1994 by accepting Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement of the IMF. Capital account liberalisation started as a part of wide-ranging reforms beginning in the early 1990s. The Rangarajan Committee recommended, inter alia, liberalisation of current account transactions leading to current account convertibility; need to contain current account deficit within limits; compositional shift in capital flows away from debt to non-debt creating flows; strict regulation of external commercial borrowings, especially short-term debt; discouraging volatile elements of flows from non-resident Indians; gradual liberalisation of outflows; and disintermediation of Government in the flow of external assistance.  A credible macroeconomic, structural and stabilisation programme encompassing trade, industry, foreign investment, exchange rate, public finance and the financial sector was put in place creating an environment conducive for the expansion of trade and investment. It was recognised that trade policies, exchange rate policies and industrial policies should form part of an integrated policy framework if the aim was to improve the overall productivity, competitiveness and efficiency of the economic system, in general, and the external sector, in particular.  BIS Review 126/2006 3 
With the onset of structural reforms in 1991-92, accompanied initially by severe import compression measures and determined efforts to encourage repatriation of capital, there was a turnaround in the second half of 1991-92. Over the next two years (1993-95), mainly due to foreign investment flows, robust export growth and better invisible performance, the balance of payments situation turned comfortable and reserves surged by US $ 14 billion. A combination of prudent and unique policies for stabilisation and structural change ensured that the crisis did not translate into generalised financial instability. In the 1990s, the lessons drawn from managing the crisis led to external sector policies that emphasised the competitiveness of exports of both goods and services, a realistic and market-based exchange rate regime, external debt consolidation and a policy preference for non-debt creating capital flows. These policies ensured that the current account deficit remained around one per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and was comfortably financed even as the degree of openness of the economy rose significantly relative to the preceding decades and capital flows began to dominate the balance of payments.  Since the mid-1990s, the management of the capital account with emphasis on risk averseness has assumed importance in the overall framework of macro economic decision making processes. While the capital account has to continue to perform its conventional role of meeting the economy’s external financing needs, the massive movement of capital through globally integrated financial markets imposes new constraints on the content and goals of policy. The pace and sequencing of liberalisation of capital account in India has been gradual in response to domestic developments, especially in the monetary and financial sector, and the evolving international financial architecture. In recent years the capital account has been dominated by flows in the form of portfolio investments including GDR issues, foreign direct investments and to a lesser extent, commercial borrowings and non-resident deposits, while traditionally, external aid was the only major component of the capital account. The compositional shifts in the capital account have been consistent with the policy framework, imparting stability to the balance of payments.  In the recent past, there has been significant liberalisation on the outflows on account of individuals, corporates and mutual funds recently, consequent upon, among other things, comfortable level of foreign exchange reserves and greater two way movement in exchange rate of the rupee. This is reflected in the increasing global operations of Indian corporates in search of global synergies and domain knowledge. Transfer of technology and skill, sharing of results of R&D, access to wider global markets, promotion of brand image, generation of employment and utilisation of raw materials available in India and in the host country are other significant benefits arising out of such overseas investments.  With significant opening up of the capital account, particularly on inflows, there were sustained foreign capital inflows since 1993-94. The net foreign assets of the Reserve Bank have also increased warranting open market operations involving sale of Government of India securities from the Reserve Bank’s portfolio and repo transactions - in order to offset the liquidity created by the purchases of foreign currency from the market; though use of cash reserve ratio is not uncommon. A Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS) was introduced in April 2004 wherein Government of India dated securities/Treasury Bills are issued to absorb liquidity. Proceeds of the MSS are immobilised in a separate identifiable cash account maintained and operated by the Reserve Bank, which is used only for redemption and/or buyback of MSS securities.  Importance of retaining external competitiveness and stability: the way forward In the present milieu, what are the issues that acquire considerable importance from the perspective of continued strengths in balance of payments?  First, the focus of external sector policy will have to continue to be on maintaining competitiveness in terms of expansion of our trade in goods and services on a sustained basis. At the aggregate level, competitiveness can be assessed in terms of trade-GDP ratio, export growth of both goods and services, and their price competitiveness. Improvements in infrastructure assume critical importance for maintaining and improving our competitiveness. We can no longer view external sector competitiveness in isolation from domestic economy.  Second, the realised product competitiveness is embedded in the shifts in the commodity composition of India's trade. India’s export base (i.e., the commodity and country composition) is far more diversified now than it used to be in the early 1990s. Rising import intensity of exports is another sign of Indian industry bracing up to higher level of competition. The preponderance of imports of capital 4 BIS Review 126/2006 
goods in import basket of India points to industrial capacity expansion with emphasis on quality of products for domestic consumption as well as exports. The world is moving forward very fast and hence productivity, increases in India have to equal and exceed that of the best producer in the world. The benchmark for our competitiveness in future is not our past but the emerging best in the field globally. Third, progressive reductions in peak tariff rates on imports have provided Indian industry access to new technology and inputs. The positive developments in the external sector enable a further rationalisation of tariffs with a view moving to a single, uniform rate on imports and further simplifying procedures in line with best global practices. The current external environment, including the level of the foreign exchange reserves, enables such a move to be made with minimal downside risks.  Fourth, in the current international context, movements in national current account balances are increasingly being recognised as manifestations of the global imbalances. The empirical evidence indicates that even current account deficits, which appear optimising from an inter-temporal perspective or are on account of private sector imbalances, run the risk of sharp reversals. Hence, the need to keep current account deficits within manageable limits – an approach followed by India in its external sector management since the early 1990s. In this regard, It is necessary to recognise the significance of approach to the Eleventh Five Year Plan 'towards faster and more inclusive growth' adopted by the National Development Council last week (9th December, 2006). It is gratifying to note that the average CAD-GDP ratio indicated is 2.8 per cent for the target growth rate of 9 per cent, thus ensuring continued comfortable level of current account deficit, as we move forward. Fifth, the current account deficit being the mirror image of the absorptive capacity of the economy should truly reflect the interplay of productive activities and the domestic absorption. Looking at the current account deficits from the angle of macroeconomic management, one should really view the current account, which, represents the demand and supply of goods and services and reflect the domestic fundamentals of growth and employment. Keeping these issues in mind, current account deficit (CAD) has to be viewed in two ways: (i) a conventional measure including all current account flows, and (ii) an adjusted measure of CAD, where workers' remittances are excluded from the current account as these represent broadly the exogenous component not driven essentially by the current pace of domestic activities and employment. The current account deficit, in a conventional sense, remained at a moderate level during last three Plans. However, an adjusted measure of CAD indicates that rapid expansion in domestic economic activities in the recent years has been reflected in higher absorption through external sector. In this light, the indicative CAD over the eleventh Five-Year Plan reflects significantly higher absorptive capacity than what the CAD to GDP ratios indicate. (See Table 7 for adjusted measure of current account balance) Sixth, the policies for FDI are critical since relative to portfolio flows they are less volatile. While the emphasis is on dismantling of regulatory entry barriers, it is necessary to ensure that they are not portfolio flows in the garb of FDI. It must be recognised that overall investment climate must be improved so that both domestic and foreign investors are attracted. In the final analysis, well over ninety per cent of our investment has to be funded by domestic saving. Hence, generalised improvements in investment climate are crucial and FDI flows will also be enabled by such an environment. Overall, consistency in legal framework within the country and in line with international standards modified to suit our needs, and accompanying State level reforms would be useful in this regard. Overall, flexibilities are essential for supply and demand responses to price signals, which are critical for improving investment climate and more generally, for an open economy that best serves the national interest.  Finally, the gross volume of capital account transactions has been rising at a rapid pace, with bi-directional flows. Capital flows are managed from the viewpoint of avoiding adverse impact on primary liquidity growth and inflationary pressures. Capital flows are to be seen in the context of supply response of the economy and vulnerabilities or potential for shocks. A key issue in managing the capital account is credibility and consistency in macroeconomic policies and the building up of safety nets in a gradually diminishing manner to provide comfort to the markets during the period of transition from an emerging market to an evolved market. This also underscores the importance of continuing prudential regulations over financial intermediaries in respect of their foreign exchange exposures and transactions, which are quite distinct from capital controls.  Let me conclude by thanking you all for giving me this opportunity and wishing the Diamond Jubilee Celebrations all the best.  Thank you. BIS Review 126/2006 5

Y V Reddy: Rural banking – review and prospects Text of the first Smarajit Ray Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr Y V Reddy, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, organised by the Andhra Pradesh Mahila Abhivruddhi Society, Hyderabad, 16 December 2006.  *      *      * Dr. Kotaiah, Mrs. Nandita Ray, Mr. C. S. Reddy, Prof. Mahendra Dev and Distinguished guests, I am grateful to the organisers for giving me an opportunity to deliver the first Smarajit Ray memorial lecture. Mr. Ray, about a couple of years younger to me in age and a valued colleague in the civil service, had been one of my close friends for almost four decades. He was a self-effacing person with courage of conviction in servicing the cause of the poor with great integrity and objectivity. I also happen to know his wife, Mrs. Nandita Ray, particularly in terms of her association with the Centre for Economic and Social Studies. Together, they worked for a better society and the betterment of the downtrodden. Given his simplicity and humility, it was difficult for many to believe that Mr. Ray had been a student of the elite Presidency College, Kolkata; Delhi School of Economics and London School of Economics. It is said that he inherited his courage of conviction from his father Mr. Ranajit, who was also of the Indian Civil Services.  Since this is the first in the series of lectures, I will recall in brief Mr. Ray’s major achievements. First, and perhaps the foremost is his pioneering role in the development of women’s help groups in Andhra Pradesh, which led the SHG movement to become the most impressive mass movement in this area.  Second relates to his innovations in the organisation of the drought prone area programme, specially in terms of people’s participation.  Third is his contribution to the programme of "back to school" which specifically targetted the children who were school dropouts and majority of whom were scheduled castes in the rural areas. Fourth, he prepared a useful document on integrated irrigation management and also helped in resettlement and rehabilitation of the project oustees.  Fifth, he helped to set up the Environment Research and Training Institute, which focused on consultancy, and training in a wide range of environment-related issues – perhaps, the first of its nature at the State level. I have been a silent admirer of his contributions and achievements in these diverse fields. However, I had a closer interaction with him in my personal and professional capacity very recently. He visited Mumbai in March 2005 to attend the Sachin Choudhury memorial lecture and at that time, I spent almost a full day with him, both in my office and at home. I was deeply impressed by his commitment to issues relating to micro finance. This prompted me to follow it up with a meeting with all people concerned with the micro finance movement involving NGOs in Andhra Pradesh at the Reserve Bank of India, Hyderabad in June, 2005. Mr. Ray helped in organising this meeting, which gave me a deep insight into the issues involved. In a sense, therefore, Mr. Smarajit Ray was a catalyst for my getting deeply involved in the matters relating to micro finance and thus, both RBI as an institution and I, at a personal level, are, therefore, indebted to him. This first memorial lecture is, thus, our way of acknowledging the inspiration that we derived from his personal conduct and his professional work. Considering the deep interest that he had shown during his life time and the relevance of that work to the RBI, I have chosen to speak on the subject of Rural Banking. After a brief review of the past and recent efforts, the current perceptions on outcomes are noted. I will then mention the national policy directions, followed by, what I would call, New Realities. I will conclude the lecture with a few issues that need to be addressed in the days ahead. Review of efforts It is useful to recall that rural banking was traditionally a monopoly of the money lenders, till the colonial government enacted Co-operative Societies Act in 1904 with a view to making the co-operatives as premier institutions for disbursement of credit. The Process of a three-tier structure BIS Review 126/2006 1 
commenced in 1915. Government was also providing agricultural loans usually called Takkavi loans, which have since been discontinued. The RBI Act vested a unique responsibility of rural credit to the central bank. All India Rural Credit Survey (1951) of the RBI opined that the co-operatives were "utter failure" in providing rural credit, but added they had a vital role in agriculture credit. The Imperial Bank was nationalised as SBI, which was visualised as a vehicle for rural banking. A rural credit survey of 1966 also concluded the ineffectiveness of co-operatives but stressed the importance of their succeeding. Many State governments legislated the registration and regulation of money lenders but with little emphasis on implementation. Nationalisation of banks in 1969 gave a boost to expansion of banks and banking in rural areas. The Reserve Bank hived off a part of its role in agricultural credit to a separate national level institution, viz, Agriculture Refinance and Development Corporation (ARDC) in 1975. Soon thereafter, a legislation was enacted to create Regional Rural Banks, with participation from Central and State governments and the nationalised banks, which have their network spread almost all over the country. Subsequently, the ARDC was converted into NABARD, which continued to get the lines of credit from the World Bank. The World Bank’s lines of credit were, however, discontinued on the ground that functioning of co-operatives had been less than acceptable. Simultaneously, the directed credit in the form of priority sector lending continued and the administered interest rate regime lasted. During the reform period, capital was infused into the RRBs and the NABARD. While the priority sector lending continued, the administered interest rate regime was dismantled. To make up for the shortfall in the priority sector lending by the banks, the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) was initiated to ensure the envisaged flow of bank resources to agriculture through the intermediation of the NABARD and the State governments. A system of Special Agricultural Credit Plan was also introduced. Innovations in the area of rural credit included Kisan Credit Cards and encouraging bank-SHG linkages. It may also be of interest to note that many District and State Co-operative Banks are yet to meet the applicable minimum capital requirements. More recently, since 2004, vigorous efforts have been made to more than double the credit flow to agriculture. Emphasis has been laid on sound credit culture, effective credit delivery and appropriate credit pricing. New instruments for financial inclusion such as General Credit Cards and no-frills accounts were initiated. Micro finance programme was intensified and new guidelines for business-facilitator model were issued. Use of technology for rural banking is being encouraged. Special Area Plans for banking in several states such as Uttaranchal, North Eastern States, Chattisgarh, Bihar and Andaman-Nicobar have been formulated to suit the local conditions. In terms of institutional development, consolidation of the RRBs, revamping of the urban co-operative banks as per the vision document, revival of rural co-operative credit structure as per the Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations, a plan for restructuring of long-term lending institutions for agriculture, and a revisit to the prescriptions relating to the priority sector lending are underway. While a Working Group to review the legislations of various States in regard to money lending has been formed, another Working Group is looking into the relief measures for the distressed farmers. Above all, as per the Government of India announcement in 2005, it has been decided to subsidise the commercial banks and NABARD to enable provision of short-term credit at 7% interest rate to the major segment of the farmers. In brief, there have been vigorous and determined efforts towards expansion of rural credit, especially through rural banking.  Current perception of outcomes The litmus test of any effort is the outcome, and perhaps even more important, the perceptions of the outcomes. These can be summed up as follows. First, the non-institutional credit still continues as far as rural areas and agriculture sector are concerned. Second, the credit-deposit ratio shows that despite the intermediation of banks, the ratio continues to be low in the rural area.  Third, the all-in costs of credit from banks, after factoring in timeliness, transaction-costs, access, etc, appears high for agriculture relative to private corporate sector even after accounting for the risks as reflected by the level of actual non-performing assets. 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
Fourth, the performance of some of the public sector banks in rural and agricultural lending is also inadequate while that of most of the private and foreign banks is even lower, despite considerable expansion of the scope of priority sector lending. Fifth, credit-system in rural areas finds it difficult to cope with the rising demands of commercialised agriculture and in any case, there are few credible risk-mitigation measures for the borrowers resulting in greater distress to the farmers in areas with significant presence of commercial crops. Sixth, while there has been notable progress in micro finance, it is, mostly confined to the states with fairly well-developed banking system. Further, the cost of credit at around 20 to 30% also appears high.  Seventh, the co-operative credit system is, in most parts, dormant and it is commented that the three-tier structure helps finance the bureaucracy rather than benefiting the farmers. Similarly, in many parts of the country, RRBs are less active though in some others they are expanding. Eighth, while there has been significant growth in rural credit in the recent years, its medium-term sustainability is contingent upon growth in agriculture and improvements in the institutional settings. In brief, the perceptions on the outcomes of vigorous and varied efforts to expand the reach of rural banking, seem to be less than expected.  Perhaps it is time we ask ourselves some questions.  First have our strategies, in terms of institutions and strategic directions, been flawed all along? Have we run out of ideas in this regard? Is our thinking on rural credit has fallen behind the emerging realities in the economy? Is there a need for distinguishing between the cause and the effect as also between the symptom and the disease? Is it lack of credit availability or want of commercial viability of agriculture that is constraining the credit-flow, or is it a complex combination of both? While we may not be able to answer many of these questions satisfactorily, I submit that we need to keep asking these right questions. New policy directions Answers to some of the complex questions relating rural credit may be found in the most recent policy directions. The National Development Council approved a week ago "An Approach to the 11th Five Year plan" which contains extensive references to the future policy directions. Some extracts from the document may be in order. On objectives and challenges "One of the major challenges of the 11th Plan will be to reverse the deceleration in agricultural growth from 3.2% observed between 1980 and 1996-97 to a trend average of around 2.0% subsequently".  "To reverse this tend, corrective policies must not only focus on the small and marginal farmers who continue to deserve special attention, but also on middle and large farmers who suffer from productivity stagnation arising from a variety of constraints". "A second green revolution is urgently needed to raise the growth rate of agricultural GDP to around 4%". On financing development "The 11th Plan must ensure that our policies are sufficiently flexible to support the development of micro finance. Interest rates in the micro finance sector have to be significantly higher than in the banking sector reflecting the much higher cost of doing business. It is important to remember that most micro-finance institutions charge rates which are much lower than rates charged by money lenders". BIS Review 126/2006 3 
On agriculture sector policy  "The failure of the organised credit system in extending credit has led to excessive dependence on informal sources usually at exorbitant interest rates. This is at the root of farmer distress reflected in excessive indebtedness".  "There is evidence that farm debt is increasing much faster than farm incomes and the larger issue of the overhanging debt stock, as distinct from credit flow, has not even been on the agenda except of a few State governments. Admittedly, there are limits to the extent that banks can be expected to play a purely social role in today’s more competitive environment. However, too conservative an approach on settling debt that has turned bad, due to contingencies of poor weather or prices, is not even prudential banking if this serves only to show bank balance sheets to be better than they are, and prevents profitable new lending. There are several suggestions, ranging from a Stabilisation Fund to be run by the Centre for automatic write-off under some specified conditions, to the setting up by States of standing professional Debt Commissions to examine individual debt (including to non-institutional sources) on a case-by-case basis for one time settlement. The 11th Plan will examine in details the impediments which now stand in the way of social and developmental banking and suggest innovations that can improve access and speed up one-time settlements while maintaining credit discipline and financial prudence". "As farmers adopt new and untried technology, and increase input intensities, they also face larger risks." "These and related issues of risk management are again largely non-plan areas but need to be addressed during the 11th Plan. This should ideally be done by concentrating on innovations in design which could help expand insurance in a manner that is financially viable without excessive subsidy." It is also useful to extract some of the statements of Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, on the subject in the meeting of National Development Council on 9th December 2006. "The 11th Plan must give top priority to redressing the weaknesses in the agricultural sector. Growth in the agricultural sector has been less than 2% per annum since the middle of the 1990s. With about half of the rural population still dependent on it for most of their income we cannot expect inclusive growth if we do not revitalise agriculture. It is important to recognise that the problem is not distributional, with the better off farmers doing well while the small farmers and the landless face hardships. Though the weaker groups clearly face more difficulties and need special attention, agriculture as a whole is in crisis. We should, therefore, focus on achieving higher productivity and incomes for all farmers in both crop and non-crop agriculture." "The Approach Paper calls for corrective action in several dimensions of agriculture. Water is a critical input for agriculture and we need to re-examine all aspects of the water economy. We are not spending enough on irrigation and what we are is not being utilised efficiently."  "In addition to investment in irrigation, we must take steps to conserve water and promote artificial recharge in rain fed areas." "Other issues on the agriculture agenda identified in the Approach Paper relate to the need for focused research in specific crops, farming systems and dry land farming practices, improved extension work to close the knowledge deficit affecting farm productivity; better seeds and inputs; enhanced facilities for credit, including revamping the co-operative credit system; initiatives to support agricultural diversification with effective marketing solutions; and completing the unfinished agenda of land reforms etc".  The four deficits Before concluding this section, I would like to invite your attention to land-mark observations made by the Prime Minister in his address at 2nd Agriculture Summit on October 18, 2006, wherein he develops the four deficits theme. "When we review our agricultural situation, it is clear that there are four deficits we need to bridge. These four deficits are (i) the public investment and credit deficit; (ii) the infrastructure deficit; (iii) the market economy deficit; and (iv) the knowledge deficit. Taken together they are responsible for the development deficit in the agrarian and rural economy." 4 BIS Review 126/2006 
"However, we need more thinking on the credit front. While the financial system should do more for the credit needs of farmers, we need to raise some questions. What do farmers need – a lower rate of interest or reliable access to credit at reasonable rates? Is our existing institutional framework adequate for meeting the requirements of our farmers who are a diverse lot? Do we need to create new institutional structures such as SHGs, micro finance institutions, etc, to provide improved and reliable access to credit? Or do we need to bring in money lenders under some form of regulation? It is necessary that we find answers to these questions in the near future." New realities It is useful to recognise that there are unprecedented structural changes in the fast-growing domestic economy and rapidly-integrating global economy. These throw up what may be called new realities but these have to be met (a) without losing sight of large population currently dependent on agriculture; and (b) the medium-term trend towards lower share of GDP generation in agriculture. Thus, while some short-term actions may be warranted to be sensitive to aspirations and expectations in rural areas, medium to longer-term strategies have to take into account what may be termed as new realities, though some of them are old realities with greater relevance now and in future. There is some recognition of these in the Approach Paper to 11th Five Year Plan, to which there was detailed reference earlier in the speech. Kindly let me elaborate on the theme here:  First, there is a continuum of agricultural and non-agricultural activities, in terms of inputs, outputs, supply chains, etc, in an emerging, highly-commercialised and globalising agriculture.  Second, there is a spectrum of financial services such as deposit taking, lending, insurance, pension, mutual finds, etc, and there exist several financial intermediaries which need to complement and compete with each other even in rural areas. Banks and banking are a part of this emerging larger whole of the financial institutions and their activities. Third, there is a clear trend towards rural–urban continuum in economic linkages and the process of integration needs to be facilitated in the interests of growth and equity. Hence, segmentation of these through public policies or procedures should, at best, be an exception than the rule.  Fourth, distinction between productive and non-productive or consumption end, becomes blurred and in any case, consumption smoothening is essential. The cash flow and risk management become more relevant relative to ensuring and monitoring end use of funds.  Fifth, today’s technology provides immense opportunities to the financial intermediaries to reach a large section of population, assess and price risks better, and minimise transaction costs. Naturally, this would need considerable business re-engineering.  Finally, there are dramatic changes in demand for food and other articles and supply of related inputs that need to constitute some of the basic elements of a new approach. These aspects of a new approach have been comprehensively and succinctly brought out in a paper by my colleague Dr. Rakesh Mohan, titled " Agricultural Credit in India: Status, Issues and Future Agenda. (RBI Bulletin, November 2004). I do not want to repeat them here.  Issues The new policy directions by NDC and the Prime Minister clearly indicate the criticality of improving the credit system but rightly position it as one of the four deficits that need to be addressed to manage the crisis of stagnation in the Indian agriculture. Agriculture development has to be led by ensuring commercial viability, which has to be enabled by an appropriate credit system. In other words, credit can be a substitute for longer-term commercial viability only if a price is paid in the financial sector and fiscal sector. At the same time, costly or inadequate credit system may constrain growth and commercial viability. The main issues in this regard, therefore, are related to, what may be called, policies complementary to credit or financial services for upliftment of rural economy. Illustratively these are: First, fiscal policy could play an enabling role in two ways in terms of (a) targetting the poor for subsidy; and (b) enhancing public investment while encouraging private investment that would benefit the rural economy. Perhaps to make agriculture commercially viable, costs and benefits of continuing with the existing allocation of resources for subsidising water, power and fertilizer need to be assessed BIS Review 126/2006 5 
vis-à-vis bestowing focused attention to providing funds for risk mitigation, investments for enhancing supply, ensuring quality and rationalising availability.  Second, trade policy, both domestic and external, should facilitate commercialising of agriculture and thus, enhance the scope for investments. Restrictions to trade within the country at a time when economy is opening up, may, at times, be less than optimal. As mentioned, the savings in rural areas and agriculture are now transmitted by the banking system to urban areas and non-agriculture, often, for want of commercially viable avenues in rural areas. Besides, banks have to improve their own risk-assessment, pricing and credit-disbursement procedures on an urgent basis.  Third, major bottleneck is inadequate arrangements for risk mitigation, be it in regard to quality or timeliness of inputs especially seed, fertilizer, water, power or price of outputs. The risk mitigation for natural calamities or vagaries of weather is often discretionary, based on assessment and response of public-policy. Risk mitigation mechanisms will make credit disbursal also less risky.  Fourth, there are attitudinal aspects that need to be considered. It is often said that fiscal support to manufacturing industry is called incentive, while similar support to agriculture is called subsidy. It may be worthwhile considering institutional arrangements and incentive framework that would facilitate attitudinal changes. Fifth, financial sector as a whole, and banking system in particular, may have to consider paradigm shift in strategies and processes consistent with new thinking, as urged by the Prime Minister and the NDC. Reserve Bank and the whole of banking system stand in readiness to serve this worthy cause of ensuring development of rural-agrarian economy by integrating it with the vibrant services and manufacturing sectors. Let me conclude by thanking the organisers for giving me the opportunity to share may thoughts on this subject, which affects a major part of our country’s population. I would also like to place on record my deep appreciation of the initiatives taken by the organisers in instituting the Memorial Lecture Series and want to assure them of my whole-hearted support to this worthy initiative. Thank you. 6 BIS Review 126/2006 
Caleb M Fundanga: Strengthening and promoting the Zambian private sector Speech by Dr Caleb M Fundanga, Governor of the Bank of Zambia, at the Celtel Loan Signing Ceremony, Lusaka, 12 December 2006. *      *      * Managing Director, Celtel Zambia plc Senior Government officials present Chief Executives Officers of commercial banks and other financial institutions present Management and staff of Celtel Zambia plc Members of the Press Distinguished invited guests Ladies and gentlemen It gives me great pleasure to join you today at this celebratory event for the Celtel Zambia plc USD105 million 5-year, two-tranche, local and foreign currency syndicated term loan facility. Undoubtedly this event marks a high-point for all those working at strengthening and promoting the Zambian private sector. In this regard, this event clearly unveils and in so doing reveals the hitherto relatively unknown sophistication and ability of the Zambian private sector and surely the coming of age of our nascent banking and financial services sector. Ladies and gentlemen, it is gratifying to observe that the facility we are celebrating today was initially launched as a USD70 million facility but was subsequently raised to USD105 million following significant oversubscription. It is equally gratifying that of the USD105 million, USD86 million or 82 per cent was raised in Zambian Kwacha primarily from Zambian commercial banks with some participation from international development finance institutions. This is a demonstration of the growing confidence in both Zambian corporate borrowers and business climate by both domestic and international banks. As Bank of Zambia, we believe that the recent economic developments, such as, the attainment of single digit inflation for the first time in three decades in April 2006 and sustaining low-level inflation for nearly three consecutive quarters so far to November 2006 are supportive of this initiative. These developments also indicate that Zambia is able to rally foreign private capital to improve the domestic financing limitations and support efforts of encouraging faster economic growth, private sector investment and exploitation of the country’s huge potential in various sectors. Ladies and gentlemen, we also believe that events such as this complement the outcomes of Government’s economic reform agenda which in part is aimed at strengthening our country’s creditworthiness as demonstrated by the attainment of the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) completion point in April 2005. Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me to elaborate. In order to strengthen and sustain our new status as a creditworthy economy following the attainment of the HIPC completion point, the Bank of Zambia, together with Government, is working on ensuring that our institutional arrangements are supportive of keeping the global investor audience, amongst others, informed about domestic economic developments transparently and on an ongoing basis. For instance, we believe that obtaining a formal sovereign credit rating would help us build part of the necessary institutional arrangements of keeping all stakeholders informed. Much in the same way, the Zambian private sector in general and Celtel Zambia plc in particular has the challenge of opening up to creditworthiness scrutiny and withstanding world-class due diligence by recognising and upholding good corporate governance norms of transparency, accountability and fairness. We are also aware that a formal sovereign credit rating undertaken by international credit rating agencies would not only further open up Zambia to global financial markets but also permit the appropriate reflection of our sovereign creditworthiness or risk premium in private sector financial dealings, which we believe is currently much better than generally held by both domestic and offshore market participants. In other words a good sovereign rating would improve the terms and conditions of international financial dealings for the Zambian private sector and businesses which could also be passed on to consumers in terms of affordable pricing and improved product quality. Ladies and gentlemen, today’s event therefore is an opportunity for honest introspection, though, this time not about the potential of our economy but about our own private and collective resolve of translating this potential into jobs, incomes and a quality life for all. We all need to recognise and BIS Review 126/2006 1 
understand that our commitment to upholding good corporate governance practices in both the public and private sectors and the resultant confidence and trust of our citizens, customers and clients be it in Government policies or private sector goods and services is inescapable for the long term health of both our society and businesses. In short, good governance works and we should all simply try it! In conclusion therefore, I would like on behalf of Bank of Zambia and indeed on my own behalf to commend the Zambian commercial banks, international banks and development finance institutions that have participated in this syndication. This is not only testimony of their confidence in Celtel Zambia plc but confidence in the Zambian people and the economy as well. I thank you. 2 BIS Review 126/2006 
Zeti Akhtar Aziz: Focus on human capital development in Malaysia Welcoming remarks by Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz, Governor of the Central Bank of Malaysia, at the INCEIF Strategic Partnership 2006, Kuala Lumpur, 14 December 2006. *      *      * Yang Berhormat, Dato' Mustapa Mohamed, Minister of Higher Education, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is my great pleasure and honour to welcome you to INCEIF Strategic Partnership in conjunction with the signing of Memorandum of Understanding between INCEIF and nine institutions of higher learning in Malaysia. This occasion is of particular significance as, on this day, with the grace of Allah, we are laying the foundation for the promotion of collaborative efforts in human capital development which will benefit the Islamic financial services industry. Against an environment of a rapidly evolving Islamic financial industry and the growing significance of Islamic financial institutions globally, human intellectual capital has become the defining factor in sustaining the performance and competitiveness of the Islamic financial industry. Indeed, the fast pace of innovation in global financial services in general and in the Islamic financial services sector in particular, demands new expertise and skills. In this environment, the creation of a substantial pool of talent is indispensable for the future growth of Islamic finance. In this regard, Malaysia has placed strong focus on human capital development through training and education.  Ladies and Gentlemen, The establishment of the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) reflects Malaysia's continuous effort and commitment towards development of a progressive Islamic financial industry by developing and enhancing human intellectual capital in Islamic finance. These efforts will also reinforce the efforts to position Malaysia as an international Islamic financial centre (MIFC). Since its establishment in March this year, INCEIF has made significant progress. To date, I am pleased to announce that INCEIF has now more than 600 registered students with 26 per cent of them coming from 21 countries. As a move to develop and encourage research in Islamic Finance, INCEIF is offering research grants for ongoing as well as new research projects. Grants are available on a competitive basis and I am pleased to note that the research grant to be awarded today covers a broad range of areas ranging from Islamic financing, product innovation, risk management and governance.  In establishing a world class centre for education and training in Islamic finance, of importance, is the combined collaborative efforts among industry players, researchers, academicians and Shariah scholars. The critical shortage of available technical talent in the Islamic financial industry can be addressed if all the relevant participants to the Islamic financial sector - the industry, the regulators, the market participants and the academia are willing to forge their efforts together on a continuous basis to elevate the performance level of Islamic finance. Today, we are paving the way for closer collaboration between INCEIF and the institutions of higher learning in Malaysia to realise our common objective of developing the pool of expertise in Islamic finance. This collaborative move, would establish a network of mutual co-operation and collaboration that would strengthen the efforts between the institutions of higher learning in the areas of curriculum development, research, training, exchange of ideas and information, and resources in Islamic finance. This partnership in connecting the knowledge communities in Malaysia needs to be developed and maintained on a long-term basis.  Entering into strategic alliances with institutions of higher learning, Islamic financial institutions and other organisations would create greater synergy, which may bring about new approaches, new technologies and new areas of specialization. Collaborative efforts between INCEIF and institutions of higher learning in particular, would strengthen the ability to leverage on the respective institutions' expertise in research. The introduction of new research findings in Islamic financial engineering could pave the way for increased innovation of new products. This would contribute towards broadening and deepening Islamic financial markets and thus strengthen the overall development of the Islamic financial industry. In addition, active collaboration between academic researchers and the practitioners will enable the practical application of research findings.  BIS Review 125/2006 1 
One of the strategic steps that INCEIF has initiated is the forging into strategic alliances with the five takaful operators to collaborate in promoting and undertaking research, development, training and education in Islamic finance. In the international arena, INCEIF has also established strategic alliances with the Islamic Research and Training Institute (IRTI) of the Islamic Development Bank, Lembaga Pengembangan Perbankan Indonesia (LPPI) of Bank Indonesia, National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) of State Bank of Pakistan and Ceylinco Sussex Business School, Sri Lanka, among others. INCEIF is also in the midst of finalising its collaborative efforts with organisations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar.  Initiatives have also been taken to enhance the pool of talent is in the field of Shariah. This has been done by awarding research grants and scholarships to deserving outstanding candidates. This initiative will be funded by the Shariah Endowment Fund which was announced in August this year. The applications for the Shariah Scholarship Award and the Shariah Research Grant for 2006 are still open to qualified candidates until the end of the year.  Apart from this, many other initiatives have been taken by the relevant bodies in Malaysia to strengthen talent development at all levels in Islamic finance. At the strategic leadership level, Malaysia has established the International Centre for Leadership in Finance or ICLIF as part of an effort to spearhead the development of a new generation of world class leaders in the financial services sector including Islamic finance towards high performance and excellence. In the development of technical expertise, the Islamic Banking and Finance Institute Malaysia (IBFIM), the industry training arm, has played an active role in producing well-trained and high calibre individuals with the necessary skills in Islamic finance. IBFIM offers advisory, training and consultancy services on Islamic banking and finance and organise seminars, workshops and conferences to create awareness and training to meet specific requirements of the industry. The programmes on offer include the fundamental aspects of Shariah, Islamic banking and takaful and risk management in Islamic financing. IBFIM has been working closely with the industry to ensure that their training and education programmes are tailored to meet the changing needs of the industry.  Ladies and Gentlemen, In conclusion, the future success of Islamic finance will depend on the co-ordinated and concerted collaborative efforts of all stakeholders, namely the Islamic finance practitioners, educators and researchers. In this regard, all parties should put in relentless efforts to continuously promote the development of Islamic finance into one which is progressive, dynamic, responsive and sustainable. While the increasingly more competitive prevailing environment raises the pressures to produce immediate-term results, it is the investment in human capital and in research and development that will secure the long-term sustainability of the industry.  With the grace of Allah, and with the support of all those involved in Islamic finance, it is our hope that INCEIF will make a meaningful contribution to the future development of Islamic finance for the benefit of the ummah.  In closing, once again, I would like to express our deepest appreciation to the Yang Berhormat Dato' Mustapa Mohamed, Minister of Higher Education for gracing this occasion and for accepting to witness INCEIF partnership with nine institutions of higher learning. Thank you. 2 BIS Review 125/2006 
Hamad Al-Sayari: Challenges posed to investment in Saudi banks Speech by His Excellency Hamad Al-Sayari, Governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, to the Symposium on Challenges Posed to Investment and Saudi Banks, Riyadh, 2 December 2006. *      *      * Dear Audience, At the beginning, I would like to welcome all honorable attendance. It gives me a great pleasure today to address you at the outset of the deliberations of this symposium on "Challenges Posed to Investment and Saudi Banks in an Environment of Global Economic Openness" which is convened at a time the Kingdom is witnessing a period of economic growth accompanied with and enhanced by steps of economic reforms in the fields of streamlining of regulations, restructuring of the national economy, and approval of a number of mega development projects as well as the accession to the World Trade Organization which is an important step towards enhancing integration into the world economy, coping with economic developments, and attraction of foreign investments apart from accession to global markets which will be reflected on the competitive capacity of the national economy. Dear Audience, The current Symposium is being held in a promising economic environment in this country. The Kingdom has recorded outstanding economic results. The real gross domestic product rose by 6.5 percent in 2005. This growth rate was reflected on almost all sectors of the economy which is characterized by strong investment. International rating agencies recorded their appreciation and certified the efficiency and strength of the national economy. Eventually, they raised the credit rating of the Kingdom to advanced grades. This environment promoted the interest of foreign investors to participate in and benefit from the various investment opportunities available in the Saudi economy. The Saudi banking system has played a vital role in the enhancement of the national economy. Thanks to its use of the latest technologies and various banking products, the banking system has witnessed good development under a supervisory system which is very keen to meet domestic requirements and legislation and to comply with international standards, including Basel Capital Adequacy Standard. The banks operating in the Kingdom are very serious in the application of this standard. As a result, the Kingdom's banking system has become one of the advanced systems, not only at the regional level but also at the international one. Dear Audience, Basel II Standards are the most important supervisory initiatives of this decade, and they will have a considerable impact on changing the conduct of risk management at all banks regardless of their size and location. The Standards aim at achieving a number of objectives, including ensuring the capital adequacy of the banking sector to encounter any latent risks and the assessment of banks' risk management systems so that the supervisory authorities could ensure that they are appropriate, in line with the risks that banks might encounter, and up to the best banking practices in the area of effective banking supervision. Basel II principles require all banks to address all risks, such as credit risks, market risks, operational risks and others. The principles envisage that banks should have in place systems that would help identify, measure, monitor and make provisions for such risks. The domestic banks are aware of the importance that the application of the new standard should coincide with concentration on risk management in keeping with the best global practices by using the best technological solutions. Reviewing the topics of this Symposium and the quality of its speakers, I see that it broadly covers aspects and all types of applications of banking risk management as Basel II principles seek to highlight and address. In conclusion, I express my deep thanks to the audience and the organizers of this symposium, and we look forward to having positive contributions and outstanding papers, wishing you all success.

Jean-Pierre Roth: Seventy years after – the final collapse of the gold standard in September 1936 Opening remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, on the occasion of the Conference “Seventy Years After: The Final Collapse of the Gold Standard in September 1936”, University of Zurich, 15 December 2006. These remarks have been prepared with the help of Mathias Zurlinden, Economic Analysis unit, Swiss National Bank. *      *      * I am pleased and honoured to open this conference on the final collapse of the gold standard in September 1936. This event, 70 years ago, marks one key date in the history of the Swiss National Bank. From the middle of the nineteenth century, gold played a pivotal role in Switzerland's monetary regime. It was central, as the foundation of the international monetary system and the anchor of the Swiss franc. And what is more, people took it for granted that the gold-based system would prevail. A hundred years later, after the Second World War, its role began to fade, although a gold parity of the franc continued to exist until 2000. When the Swiss National Bank was created, in 1907, the international gold standard stood as a potent symbol of a world characterised by free markets and free movement of capital and labour. In the memorable words of Keynes “The inhabitant of London could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighbouring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, …, bearing coined wealth upon his person …. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”1When Keynes wrote these words in 1919, the First World War had destroyed the old economic order. The international monetary system was in shambles, international trade was disrupted, and social and political unrest was making it hard to achieve any progress on economic issues. At the beginning of the war, Switzerland, like most other countries, had suspended the convertibility of its currency. Such a suspension, in a wartime emergency, was in line with gold standard thinking, as long as convertibility was resumed once the emergency had passed. After the end of the war, however, misalignments in price levels made it necessary to leave flexible exchange rates in place for the time being. Later, Switzerland was one of the countries to restore pre-war parity. In 1924, the SNB moved the exchange rate towards that goal, finally achieving it by the end of the year. Thus Switzerland was part of the gold-exchange standard that constituted the international monetary system from about 1925 to 1931. In 1929, legislation was adopted to prepare the ground for a return to a pure gold standard, with convertibility of notes into gold coins. While this pure standard never actually came about, it demonstrates that Switzerland regarded gold as the natural foundation of its monetary regime. The gold standard in the Great Depression In 1929, at the outset of the worldwide economic downturn that led to the Great Depression, the dominant view in the Swiss government, and certainly in the SNB, was that depressions were unavoidable. A downturn must run its course until good times returned, as they inevitably would. But as the depression worsened, a hands-off policy of this kind became increasingly difficult to pursue. By 1931, the situation in Switzerland was aggravated by the decision of a large number of countries to come off gold. The British suspension of convertibility in the summer of 1931 was followed by the countries of the Empire and the Scandinavian states. Then, in 1933, the United States allowed the dollar to float, before stabilising it again one year later at a vastly lower rate.                                                       1  John Maynard Keynes, "The Economic Consequences of the Peace", Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1920 (reprinted by Penguin Books, 1988). BIS Review 124/2006 1 
With the Swiss franc greatly overvalued against key currencies, the options were either deflation or devaluation. As the Swiss later realised, it would have been better to follow the British example. In 1931 and 1933, however, that option was not seen as the appropriate response. The SNB saw Britain’s suspension of convertibility in 1931 as a regrettable step that could not last. Empirical evidence showing that Britain and others had fared better after devaluing their currencies was routinely dismissed with the argument that the structure of the Swiss economy was different, since it was highly dependent on imports. It seemed to both the SNB and the Swiss government that gold was the only stable element in a turbulent world, and that the only way to restore the competitiveness of the Swiss economy, therefore, was reducing domestic costs and prices. As it turned out, the advocates of deflation miscalculated on several accounts. For one, they did not foresee that deflation would make very little progress over the coming years. Deflation policies were strongly opposed by labour and other special interest groups. Backed by the threat of referendum, this undermined the willingness of government and parliament to take an uncompromising stance. As a consequence, state interventionism was on the rise, self regulation of markets was hampered and rigid price and cost structures protracted the depression. At the same time, it appears that the advocates of deflation policies overestimated the inflationary consequences of devaluation in the countries that did devalue. The SNB repeatedly warned of the inflationary effects of devaluation, yet price increases in the UK and the US were moderate and – until World War Two – neither country regained pre-depression CPI levels. As a result, the Swiss franc remained overvalued right through to 1936, with the extent of the overvaluation changing little throughout this period. From a modern-day perspective, it may appear surprising that markets largely considered the Swiss government capable of staying the course, despite these difficulties. Most indicators suggest that the credibility of Switzerland’s commitment to the gold standard was still intact after 1933. Its gold stocks had risen – modestly at first in 1929 and 1930, and then more dramatically in 1931, when many currencies had come under pressure and had to come off gold. Between 1933 and 1935 stocks decreased significantly but were still considerably larger at the time of the devaluation in September 1936 than they had been before 1931. The movement in forward premiums on the foreign exchange market suggests the same interpretation. The premium for the British pound against the Swiss franc was modest even at the time Belgium was forced to devalue in 1935, as well as during the spring and summer of 1936. Thus the likelihood of a devaluation of the Swiss franc was seen as relatively small. Nineteen thirty-six The devaluation, when it came in September 1936, was widely regarded in Switzerland as an externally imposed step. To many, it came as a shock, since over the course of many years the Federal Council and the SNB had been constantly emphasising their view that devaluation was no remedy. The decision to devalue by about 30 percent was taken in the early afternoon of September 26, a Saturday, shortly after the devaluation of the French franc. This was followed the next day by a radio address to the nation, given by the President of the Confederation in order to reassure the Swiss people. His famous sentence, "One franc remains one franc," was intended to boost the public's confidence in the value of money. In the following week, on the Monday and the Wednesday, respectively, the two chambers of parliament endorsed the decision of the federal government. After some heated debate in the parliamentary groups, voting on the issue had been by and large along party lines. It is interesting to note how the policy reversal was explained to the public. The trigger, of course, was the French devaluation. Attention was drawn to a number of consequences of the French decision. First, the devaluation of the French franc was a further blow for the export industry and for tourism. Second, an unchanged Swiss franc parity would increase the risk of speculative attacks. Although the gold reserves were regarded as sufficiently large to hold out for some time, it could be assumed that speculation against the Swiss franc would begin right away. It was better, therefore, not to use up the gold reserves in a struggle that in all probability could not be won. The authorities conceded that the policy of the preceding years had not succeeded in restoring the competitiveness of the economy vis-à-vis the countries which had already devalued. Finally, they pointed out that the Tripartite Agreement between the American, British and French governments opened up the way for a new beginning and a more cooperative international framework. Surprisingly, perhaps, this argument was put forward as a crucial one in the early statements. However, it rapidly became clear that the hopes placed in the Tripartite Agreement might have been excessive. 2 BIS Review 124/2006 
With the devaluation of the Swiss franc, Switzerland’s monetary authorities had reneged on a fundamental commitment. But in most other ways the monetary standard remained unchanged. The currency continued to be gold-backed, and the gold parity continued to be essential. The operating procedures had not changed and, in contrast to some other countries in that period, the relationship between government and central bank was not altered at the expense of the central bank. Thus, the devaluation was seen as a painful setback in Switzerland's monetary history, but not as the dawn of a new era. Fixed exchange rates, of course, were carried over to the Bretton Woods system in the post-World War II world. And although Bretton Woods differed in many ways from the interwar gold-exchange standard, a central banker of the 1930s would have adapted without major difficulties to the world of the 1960s. The collapse of the Bretton Woods system and the subsequent move to flexible exchange rates in 1973 were far more important events in the SNB’s 100-year history than the devaluation of 1936. Indeed, the crisis of the international monetary system in the early 1970s essentially transformed the SNB’s task and scope for action. Switzerland gained full control of its money supply, price stability became the primary objective of monetary policy and the legal framework of the SNB was gradually amended accordingly. Beyond the gold standard As I said at the outset, the role of gold has faded over the years. But gold had an afterlife long after it ceased to be relevant in any form for the conduct of monetary policy. First and foremost, the legal link between the Swiss franc and gold continued to exist until very recently. The constitutional changes that severed this link took effect in 2000, followed, within the same year, by the corresponding changes in the relevant law. The new law no longer includes an obligation on the part of the SNB to redeem banknotes for gold – an obligation which – in practice – had been suspended for decades. Moreover, it has abolished the minimum gold coverage of the banknotes in circulation and the gold parity of the Swiss franc. With these changes, gold finally became a normal and marketable asset for the SNB. In May 2000, the SNB began to sell part of its gold stock. About 50 percent of the gold once owned by the SNB has now been sold. I should emphasise that the SNB will continue to hold gold as a monetary reserve, but the legal relics of the gold standard era no longer immobilize the gold stock as they did for decades. A second aspect of the afterlife of the gold standard is its presence in discussions on domestic and international monetary standards. In the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation was high and exchange rates volatile, a small but vocal group endorsed the gold standard as an alternative to the paper standard of the post-Bretton Woods era. Judged by practice, they were on the losing side. There appears to be a widespread consensus – both among economists and central bankers – that a gold standard generates few positive things that cannot be provided by other means. For one, the gold standard has all the drawbacks of fixed exchange rates. That is, monetary policy cannot be used to achieve domestic goals and the parities are vulnerable to speculative attacks. Also, the gold standard has all the disadvantages of a commodity standard. In other words, the system is not only expensive to maintain, it also allows the supply and demand conditions for the commodity in question to affect the general price level. Some advocates of the gold standard did not propose the gold standard as an international system but promoted it as a tool for solving domestic problems. In particular, they argued that the link to gold, by providing a credible anchor, would keep inflation under control. This argument is valid as far as it goes, but ignores the fact that a gold standard has its own credibility problems. If countries can tie their currencies to gold, they can also untie their currencies from gold. This is what happened in the 1930s. The markets know that and form their expectations accordingly. For this reason, most countries preferred to go other ways. In recent years, many of them have adopted clear mandates for their central banks which specify price stability as the primary goal. They then try to achieve this goal with some form of inflation target – be it implicit or explicit. Results have been good so far, although not all can be attributed to improved policy making. Some have argued that globalisation and the move towards more competitive markets have reduced inflationary pressures, thus making inflation targets easier to reach. But whatever the reasons, the results in recent years have been encouraging. I believe that as long as this continues, and central banks succeed in keeping inflation under control, the appeal of the gold standard will remain limited. But I have no illusions that commodity money will be discussed again as an alternative should central banks fail to achieve their goals and inflation rise to high levels. BIS Review 124/2006 3 
In concluding, let me re-emphasise the fact that the devaluation of the franc was a major event in our monetary history. But although this devaluation was considered to be of great importance, it was not seen to herald the end of the gold-backed system. It took about 40 years – and many other difficulties – before flexible exchange rates were regarded as a feasible option, and more than 60 years before the gold parity of the franc was removed. Today the 1936 devaluation remains vivid in the memory of the general public. The Swiss like to remember that their currency has only been devalued once since its creation in 1850. With or without the gold standard, the history of the Swiss National Bank has been marked by a continuous search for a stable anchor. In order to protect the purchasing power of money and the price competitiveness of a country largely dependent on exports, monetary stability has been the overriding target of SNB policy throughout its one hundred year history. Of course, seen from a modern-day perspective, mistakes have been made and decisions taken too late – the 1936 devaluation can be seen as an example of this – but the fact that we can still use the set of coins introduced in 1850, when the franc was created, shows that Switzerland, thanks to prudent policy, has succeeded in avoiding the monetary disorders that have plagued so many European countries since the nineteenth century. 4 BIS Review 124/2006 
Durmuş Yilmaz: Dollarization – consequences and policy options   Speech by Mr Durmuş Yilmaz, Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, at a Conference on “Dollarization”, Istanbul, 14 December 2006.  *      *      * Distinguished Governors, Academicians and Guests, I would like to welcome you all to the conference entitled “Dollarization: Consequences and Policy Options”. I would also like to thank you for sharing your precious knowledge and experiences with us. As this conference is one of the activities organized in the context of the 75th anniversary of the Central Bank of Turkey, it gives me an honor to give the start for it. Before continuing with my speech, I would like to comment on the motives that lie behind the topic of this conference. Although we have never had hyperinflation, we, in Turkey, experienced high and chronic inflation for the past almost 30 years before 2001. Living long years with chronic inflation led to huge losses in the credibility of our national currency, which is important for us as an institution responsible for issuing banknotes and maintaining stability of the money. In this sense, it will be appropriate indeed to discuss dollarization in depth, I believe. Given the wide range of issues related to dollarization and the limited time available, I will make some brief remarks on the concept of dollarization in general and touch upon the Turkish experience in particular. Dear Guests, Dollarization has evolved as one of the noteworthy features of globalization during the last two decades. The integration of the international financial system, the removal of restrictions on capital mobility and the increasing trade volumes have contributed to the evolution of dollarization. Although it was a phenomenon in different economies for a long time, the word “dollarization” has become a well-known term in the 90’s. In this period, the number of countries that gave foreign currencies the legal tender status increased and the official dollarization has been a widely discussed issue. Alternatively, unofficial dollarization has expanded even more and become a pervasive phenomenon in a wide range of countries. The number of countries where the ratio of foreign exchange deposits to total deposits higher than 30 percent increased from 7 in 1990 to 46 in the year 20001. Similarly unofficial dollarization in Turkey has also evolved during this decade. In this sense, I will focus on unofficial dollarization in the rest of my speech. Distinguished Guests, In general, dollarization occurs in circumstances where residents lose confidence in their own currency. The evidence from countries has also shown that dollarization process advances by certain stages. At the first stage, domestic currency loses its function of being a store of value, which is called “asset substitution”. Following this basic level, dollarization takes the form of “currency substitution” referring to the domestic currency’s loss of functions as being unit of account and means of payment. Apart from this, dollarization can take some other forms like “liability dollarization”, “payments dollarization”, “real dollarization” and “financial dollarization”. Among these, particularly financial dollarization, which can be described as the combination of asset and liability dollarization, has gained ground in recent years in many emerging countries, including Turkey. I can cite the following factors, which I am going to examine under the two main groups, as influential on dollarization: namely the macroeconomic instability and the market imperfections. In the context of macroeconomic instability, inflation is the most important issue to be considered: dollarization is a rational response of economic agents to inflation uncertainty that reduces the confidence in domestic currency. In this regard, dollarization is technically explained through the higher expected volatility of inflation-relative to that of real  exchange rate by the portfolio approach.                                                       1  De Nicolo, G.; Honohan, P.; Ize, A. (2003); “Dollarization of the Banking System: Good or Bad?”; IMF Working Paper; WP/03/146. BIS Review 124/2006 1 
Also, the issue of high and fragile public debt structure along with high budget deficits has considerable impact on dollarization. In the case of “time inconsistency”, when governments create inflation in order to decrease the real burden of the debt, the risk premium of the debt denominated in domestic currency tends to rises. In essence, this pushes governments to borrow in foreign currencies, and hence gives rise to dollarization. In this respect, “original sin” is a specific term, which was first coined by Eichengreen and Hausmann2 in 1999; and which means that countries without fully developed financial markets are obliged to borrow in foreign currencies since borrowing in their national currencies at longer maturities is almost impossible. The other main factor behind the dollarization is related to the market imperfections. Market distortions, fixed exchange rate regime accompanied with high inflation, low institutional quality, poorly developed domestic financial markets, currency-blind financial regulations and safety nets in foreign currency such as deposit insurance can all be evaluated under this framework. Due to those imperfections, moral hazard problems arise and this in turn results in a larger demand for foreign currency. As the studies3 have showed, the low quality of legal and political institutions and the lack of legal protection for domestic creditor provide incentives for dollarization. Dear Guests, Now, the question is why we should care about dollarization. Before anything else, it increases a country’s vulnerability to shocks. Let me also mention the vulnerabilities of two major sectors in an economy: one arising from dollarization in private sector and the other one having to do with dollarized public debt dynamics. Beginning with the private sector, the dollarized financial systems and the companies’ balance sheets are obviously exposed to solvency risks, due to currency mismatch problem. Keeping in mind that the risks for both financial and real sectors are interrelated, the banks that lend in foreign currency to firms, which earn revenues in domestic currency, are also indirectly affected. In such cases, the whole economy becomes more vulnerable to shocks due to amplified risks resulting from dollarization. A recent strand of literature and country cases such as the Asian meltdown of 1997 and the 2000-2001 banking crisis in Turkey, have all emphasized the importance of such vulnerabilities brought about by dollarization. Moreover, firms adjust their prices more frequently in a dollarized economic environment where depreciation of national currency is perceived as permanent. Thus, dollarization leads to higher pass through effect from exchange rates to prices via deteriorating pricing behaviour of firms. Ultimately, from the public sector’s point of view, the issue of debt sustainability is highly influenced by dollarization. In fact, public sector is exposed to problems similar to that of non-trading firms indebted in foreign currency4. There is no doubt that dollarized debt adversely affects government’s solvency as its assets are in domestic currency. In this sense, given the high level of dollarization, the fluctuations in real exchange rate might turn an apparently sustainable fiscal situation into an unsustainable one. Furthermore, public sector insolvency can immediately lead to banking sector insolvency if domestic banking system holds large claims against government. Dear Guests, Before continuing with the Turkish experience, I have to add that dollarization deserves a special attention from a central banker’s perspective. As we all know, the choice of exchange rate regime is of critical importance for a central bank. The empirical findings show that in economies with serious balance sheet mismatches, the policy makers prefer fixed or controlled exchange rate regimes5..                                                       2  Eichengreen, B.; Hausmann, R.

On the other hand, flexible exchange rate regimes provide more room for monetary policy that enables to respond to external shocks freely. It has also been found by using cross-country data for the banking sector that more volatile exchange rates reduce the share of the foreign currency denominated loans and deposits6, thus contributes to prevent dollarization. However, even if a flexible exchange rate regime is chosen de jure, dollarization and high pass through effect from exchange rates to inflation may cause “fear of floating”, thus monetary authorities are put under pressure to intervene in fluctuations in exchange rates at all costs. In such a case, the policy makers are left in a big trade off between monetary policy independence and balance sheet mismatches7. Obviously, there is not one single commonly accepted solution for all countries. Nevertheless, country experiences in recent years have shown us that there is a tendency in choosing more flexible exchange rate regimes under the assumption that vulnerabilities regarding mismatch problems are accurately hedged. Subsequently, dollarization affects monetary policy through the increased volatility of money demand. Thus, the traditional transmission of monetary policy would not work properly as central banks have no direct control over foreign currency assets. Accordingly, as Kevin Cowan and his colleague8 mentioned in their study, dollarization limits the capacity of central banks to conduct stabilizing monetary policy in the short run and to a large extent limits the ability of monetary authority gain credibility in the long run. Distinguished Guests, Having given a brief introduction into the notion of dollarization, now I would like to talk about the Turkish case. As in the evidence of the other countries, the dollarization in Turkey also took its roots from macroeconomic instability with fixed or predictable exchange rate regimes, inefficient market regulations and the lack of credibility of economic policies. In order to comprehend the dollarization in Turkey better, it would be reasonable to look at the macroeconomic instability and examine the evolution of dollarization in a historical perspective. With the 1980’s liberalization policies, the barriers on foreign exchange transactions of commercial banks were removed and the Turkish residents were allowed to open foreign exchange deposits in 1983. Beginning from that date, the volume of foreign currency denominated deposits had started to increase. In my opinion, the liberalization of the financial system without macroeconomic stability and the necessary institutional and structural changes made the economy more vulnerable to shocks in 1990’s. Besides, the imprudent fiscal policies resulted in high levels of public sector borrowing requirement and put the debt sustainability on top of the agenda. Along with it, the accommodative monetary policies and the lack of the Central Bank independence led to high and chronic inflation rates. In order to tame inflation and to achieve the macroeconomic stability, a number of exchange rate based stabilization programs were launched, but all of them were either interrupted or abandoned, causing loss of confidence to economic policies. Accordingly, 1990s and the early 2000s were the times, during which Turkey had frequently faced with economic crises and turmoils. Average annual inflation realized as around 75 percent in the period between 1990 and 2001. The ratio of net public debt to GNP reached to 90 percent by 2001. All these, coupled with the currency-blind market regulations such as blanket guarantee on foreign exchange deposits boosted the financial dollarization in Turkey. A closer look into the figures indicates how severe the dollarization was. From 1990 to the end of 2001 the ratio of foreign exchange deposits to total deposits increased from the level of 25.5 percent to 57.6 percent; the share of foreign exchange deposits in broad money supply went from 19.7 percent to 55                                                       6  Arteta, C.

percent. Similarly as of 2001, the share of foreign currency loans in the total loans of the banking sector reached to 47.2 percent, while the share of foreign currency denominated and indexed debt of the government in its total domestic debt increased to 36 percent9. As of 2001 Turkey became one of the most dollarized economies in the world. Distinguished Guests, Dollarization process in Turkey has two striking characteristics. First of all, dollarization rose significantly even the real rates of return on foreign exchange deposits were lower than that on the Turkish currency deposits. This indicates the fact that the political and macroeconomic instability in the country, particularly high inflation and inflation uncertainty, had played the major role in the dollarization process. Secondly, Turkey had lived through the first stage of dollarization in which the foreign currency is used mainly as a store of value and partly as a unit of account, but not as a medium of exchange. In this context, the dollarization in Turkey can be called as financial dollarization. Distinguished Participants, After the 2001 crisis, the implementation of tight monetary and fiscal policies together with the structural reforms has enabled the country to bring the inflation down to single digit numbers and to reduce the ratio of public debt to GNP significantly. Also, financial markets have become deeper and less fragile. In this context, the banking sector reform that aimed to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking sector, restructure the public banks, improve the asset and loan quality and the capital adequacy ratio of the system has been of great importance. Additionally, the progress made towards economic stability, particularly the significant decrease in inflation, enabled us to drop six zeros from the Turkish currency. This currency reform has increased the credibility of the Turkish currency both in internal and external markets. The issuance of the New Turkish Lira debt instruments by foreign banks in the international markets is an important indicator of this increasing credibility. Consequently, the desire and the need to invest in foreign currency in order to hedge the value of wealth decreased significantly and investors have started to increase the share of Turkish currency assets in their portfolios. The amendments made in the Law of the Central Bank of Turkey in 2001 have been a turning point and instrumental for the efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability. With these amendments, achieving and maintaining price stability is stated as the primary objective of the Central Bank and the Bank acquired its instrumental independence. In fact, the independency has given the Bank the opportunity to set its policies for longer terms, free of political cycles and pressures. As an assurance given to the public to ensure the long term price stability objective, the independence of the Central Bank of Turkey together with its transparent and effective communication policy have increased the credibility of the monetary policy. Besides, the new monetary policy framework implemented first as implicit and then as full-fledged inflation targeting regime together with the floating exchange rate regime have contributed a lot to the decline in dollarization since 2002, as the literature10 suggests. In this respect, we can observe the findings of the portfolio approach in Turkey very clearly. To be more specific, the volatility of exchange rates has increased due to floating exchange rate regime on the one hand and inflation and its volatility have declined significantly on the other. Since higher exchange rate volatility relative to inflation volatility decrease the hedging benefits of foreign currency assets11 this monetary policy framework can be said to help the process of “liraization”, a term that was suggested by Dr. Leiderman at the conference on “Inflation Targeting: Performance and Challenges” hold by the Central Bank of Turkey at the beginning of this year.                                                       9  Bahmani-Oskooee, M.; Domaç, I.; “On the Link Between Dollarization and Inflation: Evidence from Turkey”; The Eighth Dubrovnik Conference on Monetary Policy and Currency Substitution in Emerging Markets; Dubrovnik; June 27-29, 2002. 10 Leiderman, L; R.

Here, I want to make a point on the floating exchange rates. The floating exchange rate regime has transferred the exchange rate risk to the market and made economic agents to perceive and understand the importance of risk management and using hedging instruments and derivatives market better. In this context, as we have mentioned in several platforms, the opening of the Turkish Derivatives Exchange Market in February 2005 has been an important step. Accordingly, promoting the use of this Market by a wider range and the development of the hedging instruments further are very important for both the financial stability and dedollarization. Distinguished Guests, As a result of the steps taken towards macroeconomic stability and the implementation of prudent policies, the level of dollarization in Turkey started to decrease after 2001, despite some pauses. As of November 2006, the share of foreign exchange deposits in the total deposits12 and in the broad money supply were 38 percent and 35.5 percent respectively. Also the ratio of foreign currency loans to total loans in the banking sector decreased to the level of 16 percent in the same period. Moreover the share of the foreign currency denominated and the indexed debt of the government to total domestic debt decreased to 15.8 percent as of October 2006. By any measure, this, I believe, is a remarkable performance. But all these positive developments do not enable us to call it a persistent and permanent dedollarization process, for sure. It is apparent that the level of dollarization in Turkey is still high, which is an important challenge for monetary policy-making. Obviously, the dollarization is not declining fast naturally. This confirms the evidence that even if the inflation falls and the macroeconomic stability is maintained to great extent, the memories of the past inflationary and unstable economic environment can cause economic agents to carry on their past habit of holding foreign currency assets and create an inertia. Therefore, even a small threat to the macroeconomic stability or any kind of internal or external development that increase uncertainty perceptions can easily lead to a deterioration in expectations and give rise to an increase in dollarization. The last turmoil in the global and domestic financial markets has been a concrete proof of this fact. Thus, the dedollarization is not a straightforward process. As a clear evidence of this, the findings of Reinhart and her friends13 show that only two countries, Israel and Poland, out of a total of 85 countries managed to achieve large and lasting declines in domestic dollarization. Accordingly, we can say that dedollarization is a difficult and long lasting process that is very much related with the macroeconomic stability and proper incentives. Hence, what we should do first is to continue with the current sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in a decisive way. Second, in order to start dedollarization, an active dedollarization strategy such as the so-called “carrot and stick approach” in the literature, which consists of regulations that will encourage the use of the Turkish currency, should be planned. However, as Ize and Levy-Yeyati14 suggest, before launching an overly ambitious policy agenda, we should make all the necessary researches to understand the roots, risks and costs of dollarization and the implications of policy reforms made against it. I think, this conference provides a big opportunity for all of us to share our opinions and experiences and to enlighten our way of dedollarization. Distinguished Participants, I would like to conclude my words by repeating that I am very glad to welcome such distinguished economists from all over the world. I am sure that we have a lot to draw on the experiences of each other. I hope you enjoy both the conference and your stay in Istanbul. Thank you very much.                                                       12 Provisional data. 13  Reinhart, C.M; K.S.

Krzysztof Rybiński: Global imbalances and implications for emerging markets Address by Mr Krzysztof Rybiński, Deputy President of the National Bank of Poland, at the Panel Discussion on Scenarios for Emerging Markets at the OKB Roundtable, Vienna, 14-15 December 2006. Views presented here are my own and they do not represent the official position of the National Bank of Poland. Here I only sketch the key arguments, extensive discussion of issues related to global imbalances is presented on my blog www.rybinski.eu. *      *      * ‘Hard’ and ‘soft’ landing are aeronautical terms. Many decades ago plane crashes were so alarmingly frequent, that some believed that every flying plane was an accident waiting to happen. Today, the advance of technology makes the past concerns look ridiculous; plane crashes are rare and require exceptionally adverse weather conditions, human failure or a terrorist attack. Likewise, large current account deficit in the United States and large current account surpluses in China and oil-exporting countries, jointly labeled as global imbalances are considered as unstable just as planes used to be several decades ago. Similar aeronautical vocabulary – hard landing, soft landing, crash etc. – is also used to describe the range of possible outcomes for the global economy, which embarked on a global imbalances journey about ten years ago1. The goal of my speech, which is constrained in time to ten minutes is to stimulate discussion on what could be the implications of global imbalances on emerging markets, in particular what are possible EM scenarios in case of soft and hard landing of the global plane. As you will see later the range of possible outcomes depends on what is the actual cause of the emergence of the global imbalances. Let me briefly review the most popular hypotheses. How did we get into global imbalances? The need to identify the type of the flying airplane and its technical conditions implies that one has to understand the nature of global imbalances. And here we run into the first problem, as the top ‘aviation specialists’, including ‘pilots’ themselves cannot agree on that. I have identified at least ten major views about the nature of global imbalances, namely2: 1. emergence of the new Bretton Woods regime3. This concept was put forward by Michael Dooley, David Folkerts-Landau and Peter Garber, who argue that a new world equilibrium has emerged and it is in the best interest of both the United States and China to continue financing consumption of American households with Chinese savings until Chinese economy reaches a status of a developed economy, so the new Bretton Woods can last for many years; 2. global savings glut hypothesis was proposed by Ben Bernanke4, who postulates that the shock causing global imbalances originated from Asia as a result of excessive saving rates;                                                       1  I borrowed this aeronautical comparison from a recent paper by Calvo G. and Talvi E. (2006) “The Resolution of Global Imbalances: Soft Landing in the North, Sudden Stop in Emerging Markets?”, CERES, Documentos de Trabajo. 2  This list is based on Rybinski K.

states that there is a shortage of supply of assets – particularly in emerging markets – relative to demand for these assets. Problem lies in underdevelopment of financial markets in emerging economies amid various macro- and microeconomic deficiencies. No single hypothesis is able to explain global imbalances well. I do have a consistent story explaining the sequence of events that led to development of the global imbalances. I will not present it here, those interested may take a look at my blog www.rybinski.eu15. Today I will present two opposing views of what could be the implications of global imbalances for emerging markets: I call them the Calvo view16 and the Caballero view17.  Calvo view: soft landing in the US and sudden stops in some emerging markets • if EM central banks stop buying dollars and UST, they will at the same time stop issuing bonds in domestic currencies which are used to sterilize money markets. It will not imply a change in total world debt level, but a change in the total world debt composition. If bonds are highly substitutable (as might be in the case of UST and JGB) then if Japan were to stop buying US debt instruments the effect on US rates would be minimal. PBoC cannot stop buying foreign debt instruments as it would imply very big appreciation of renminbi, it can change the currency structure of its reserve holdings. This would force a change in composition of debt in hands of private investors and the impact on US rate would be small again.  • in the scenario of rapid adjustment of US current account deficit, for example following sizeable Asian currencies appreciation, current account surpluses in EM would have to correct massively, some countries may find that their current account surpluses are smaller than debt amortizations, and history shows that in 18 percent of cases sudden stops in emerging markets took place under current account surpluses. • Calvo view implies very low risk of US long term rates going up (high likelihood of soft landing, low likelihood of hard landing), and relatively high risk of some emerging markets experiencing sharp current account reversals and possibly sudden stops. • Calvo view is reinforced in the recent paper by Faruqee, Laxton, Muir, Presenti (2006)18, which shows that even when a new wave of protectionism hits the global economy, the US growth will slow only marginally by 0.2 percent, while impact on Asia could be sizeable, reducing growth by more than 1 percent.  Caballero view: bubbles are inevitable and possibly long-lasting in economy facing asset shortages • there has been significant increase in global savings relative to investments (you can merge Bernanke global savings glut with IMF global investment drought hypotheses here) • this excess saving is chasing too few available financial assets, which leads to very high valuations (rising equity indices, low long-term rates, low corporate and EM spreads etc.) • problem lies in the underdevelopment of financial markets in emerging economies, which due to poor governance and property rights do not have enough good quality collateral to back debt obligations. These economies have also many other macroeconomic and microeconomic deficiencies leading to asset shortages and reduction of value of existing assets such as: weak bankruptcy procedures, chronic macroeconomic volatility and sheer appropriation risk.                                                        15 http://www.rybinski.eu/wp-content/uploads/gi_en_rybinski_panel_discussion_1_09_2006.pdf16  Calvo G. and Talvi E.

• Anglo-saxon countries which are very good at producing financial assets have already shown enormous imbalances, with US current account deficit and housing market bubbles as the headline examples;  • emergence of (long lasting) asset bubbles and drop in inflation (and possibly even emergence of deflation) are market mechanisms to bridge the asset gap; • bursting an asset bubble makes asset shortages problem worse; • while financial markets development moves ahead (think about large listings in China, improving corporate governance or rapid development of credit derivatives) it is unlikely that excess demand for assets will be eliminated soon, as it seems to have a structural origin, related to demographics (aging), or to higher uncertainty for corporations operating in more competitive global economy in XXI century, which probably explains why profits to GDP ratio is at 40-years high and investments fail to recover to pre-Asia-crisis and pre-dot-com-boom levels It does matter to what view of the world you subscribe, as it dramatically alters the subjective likelihood of competing scenarios for 2007. As PIMCO Michael Gomez puts it in September emerging markets note titled “Is it safe?”19: “EM has historically been vulnerable to deteriorating economic and financial conditions in the United States and other developed countries. Slower growth, tighter liquidity, and heightened risk aversion in mature markets generally mean lower commodity prices, less capital flows, and higher interest rates for EM borrowers - conditions that helped produce some spectacular financial crises in the past dozen years. Not a pretty picture, and one that begs the question of what lies around the corner“. However, if asset shortages story is correct, then upcoming US slowdown (or brief recession according to some non-consensual forecasts) would likely further increase excess saving (as fading growth prospects will discourage investment projects and encourage more private saving amid rising uncertainty, only partly offset by higher public dissaving due to automatic stabilizers), and lower valuation of US equities will make the world supply of assets even more scarce. In such situation US economy having hard times may not necessarily lead to higher risk premia for emerging markets (as it was the case in the past) rather any increase in risk premia would be used by investors to enhance returns, spread compression will continue, and yield curve inversion may even deepen on major markets, and knock the door in some emerging markets20. PIMCO seems to subscribe to this possibility, although they do not use asset shortage argument, but they do say: “Local markets investments may provide the greatest divergence of returns within the EM universe, with those “developing” economies furthest along the road to “developed” market status able to enact traditional policy prescriptions in a slowing global economy and therefore providing enhanced return potential to local fixed-income instruments“. As a central banker in emerging market economy well advanced on the road to developed status I ask myself a question which view of the world is correct, because it may have different implications for growth and inflation prospects. Should we expect slowing external demand combined with local currency strength or combined with a local currency weakness. These are important questions (even in the context of falling exchange rate pass-through) which will be empirically answered next year. Today we can think only in balance of risks terms. Evidence in the last few months, including December BIS report21 shows, that official institutions may have accelerated their attempts to diversify reserve assets, which may mean more demand for high-yielding assets and for non-core currencies, and in particular for emerging market currencies (recall Government of Singapore Investment Corporation statement that emerging market weight in their assets under management will be increased, recall a number of hints given by oil exporting nations, or recall the statements given by                                                       19  Gomez M. (2006) „Is it safe?”, Emerging Markets Watch, PIMCO, September 2006. 20  I acknowledge that it would be against the historical evidence that after the end of the tightening cycle and the beginning of easing cycle the fall of 2-year rates was deeper than that of 10-year rates. But it is precisely the issue we discuss here: are historical patterns a good guide for the future? 21 BIS (2006) „Quarterly review”, Bank for International Settlements, December 2006. 4 BIS Review 124/2006 
Chinese authorities that the central bank should be more open-minded about cooperating with the government institutions in managing huge reserve assets). So, ceteris paribus, this factor will imply balance of risks skewed towards further risk premia compression in emerging markets in situation when US growth slows and expected returns in developed markets drop amid poor growth outlook. The important question is how it will end? Temporary US growth slowdown is unlikely to solve global imbalances issue, it is unlikely that oil-exporting countries will accelerate further their investment in real estate, as the pace is already frantic, lack of reforms in the eurozone indicates that potential output in this part of the world is unlikely to speed up significantly. So standard, consensus prescriptions will not work. The only feasible channel that might work is accelerating the pace of financial sector development, particularly in emerging markets, to produce more financial assets and more collateral. These reforms are easier to implement, because they do not require taking away social benefits and they do not hit any specific groups of interests. So it appears that the discussion should shift away from overvaluation of renminbi, and from implications of pegging gulf currencies to the weakening dollar, towards ways of speeding up necessary financial markets reforms in saving-abundant countries. If these reforms gain speed, we may be able to solve global imbalances problem without much global pain. As a concerned central banker from emerging (converging) market I would welcome your comments, do you share the Calvo view or the Caballero view of the world. To borrow a phrase from Calvo-Talvi paper again, planes are much safer nowadays, but not everywhere.  Thank you for your attention. BIS Review 124/2006 5 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Recent economic and financial developments in Switzerland Introductory remarks by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 14 December 2006. *      *      * As stated in our press release, the Swiss National Bank is raising its target range for the three-month Libor with immediate effect by 0.25 percentage points to 1.50–2.50%. The SNB intends to hold the rate in the middle of the target range for the time being.  Economic activity in Switzerland is very robust. Next year, the economic trend is likely to continue favourable, albeit somewhat less pronounced. This will have a positive effect on the labour market. The National Bank is expecting real GDP to grow by just under 3% in 2006 and by around 2% in 2007.  Declining oil prices have pushed back inflation. Average inflation for 2006 is likely to stand at 1.1%. By lifting the target range, the National Bank ensures that the inflation outlook will remain favourable, even in view of the high level of utilisation of economic resources. On the assumption of an unchanged three-month Libor of 2.00%, it expects annual inflation to reach 0.4% in 2007 and 0.9% in 2008. If the economy performs as expected, the SNB will further pursue its strategy of gradual normalisation of its interest rates. The economy is currently in excellent shape and has clearly strengthened during the past two years. At the monetary policy assessment at the end of 2004, we had suspended a normalisation of the interest rates after previously having lifted the three-month Libor from a low point of 0.25% to 0.75% in June and September. The three-month Libor remained at that level up to December 2005 when we made the decision to resume the normalisation process, given the improved economic outlook. Today's decision – an interest rate hike for the fifth time in succession – confirms the stance we have taken.  International environment The change in the international environment with the most tangible impact since the monetary policy assessment in September concerns the price of oil. The current oil prices are clearly below the highest level of 78 dollars per barrel of Brent crude which was reached in August. Will we see higher oil prices again? There is no real conclusive answer to this question. What we have witnessed is nonetheless the longest interruption of a rising trend since the beginning of 2004. This decline will weaken inflation in most countries in the year ahead. However, the economic impact of the reduced oil prices is likely to be low, if we bear in mind that the oil price is still approximately three times higher than it was five years ago. At least the oil price has not put any additional damper on the economy since the last monetary policy assessment.  Another significant factor for Switzerland is the marked improvement of the economic situation in Europe, in particular in Germany. For 2006, growth forecasts in our neighbouring countries have been gradually revised upward; for 2007, development is expected to be more muted. Economic activity in the United States, however, has slowed at a somewhat faster pace than anticipated. In 2007, the US economy is set to expand in the area of potential growth again. Asia will continue its dynamic growth pattern.  Economic situation What does the situation look like in Switzerland? As anticipated at the last monetary policy assessment, the economic situation has continued to improve. It is both balanced and broadly based. As the latest employment figures reveal, the momentum in the economy has spilled over into the labour market. A great many new jobs were created in the third quarter, and unemployment continued to decline. The number of gainfully employed persons rose by approximately 100,000 from Q3 2005 to Q3 2006. The unemployment rate is likely to fall below the 3% mark at the beginning of 2007. The brighter outlook on the labour market has improved job security and strengthened consumer confidence. Expenditure by private households is soaring. Companies appear upbeat as well. Many BIS Review 123/2006 1 
industries, such as manufacturing, construction and the hotel trade, report full employment. According to our assessment, this translates into unchanged growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) of just under 3% in 2006. For 2007, we predict a decline in economic momentum. Almost all components of demand continue to grow, albeit at a more moderate pace. Private consumption will benefit from the healthy improvement in disposable income. Equipment investment is being stimulated by the high rate of utilisation of production capacity and the favourable business outlook in many industries. Residential construction is likely to see a measure of calm. Yet increased investment in commercial and industrial building may offset this development to some extent. The somewhat weaker global economic development – though still favourable overall - will probably continue to have a positive impact on exports. For 2007, we expect overall GDP growth of about 2%. Monetary developments Allow me to explain developments in the financial markets and the monetary aggregates. Two topics merit particular attention: the development of credit and money supply and the exchange rate. In addition to long-term interest rates and exchange rates, loans – among other things – play an important role when changes in key interest rates are transmitted to the economy. What information can we derive from the development of lending activity? Loans are registering constant growth. Mortgage loans, which account for the great majority of all bank loans, have grown at a rate of more than 5% since 2003. This is a reflection of the clearly expansionary monetary policy at that time. The growth rate of mortgage loans has gradually slowed, however, and is now slightly below 5%. This is nevertheless still a high growth rate.  Other loans, however, are witnessing stronger growth and are currently expanding by 6%. Unsecured loans, in particular, are rising substantially. During phases of favourable economic development, there is greater willingness to grant unsecured loans. This was the case in 1999, when the economy found itself in a similarly robust state. There is a long-term correlation between loan volume and the M3 aggregate. Loan development typically lags behind the development of money supply. Monetary aggregates have grown only moderately for the past three years. The M3 monetary aggregate is currently growing at a modest 2%, while M1 and M2 are even registering a decline. The measured development of the monetary aggregates suggests a slowdown in lending.  The development of the Swiss franc attracted considerable attention as it has weakened vis-à-vis the euro since the beginning of the year, although it has firmed against the US dollar. To gauge the effects of exchange rates on the economy, we need to make use of the inflation-adjusted exchange rate that is also weighted to take account of the importance of individual trading partners. Measured by this real, effective exchange rate, the Swiss franc today is at the same level as it was in 2000.  In what way do exchange rate developments enter into our decision-making process? The exchange rate is important to the extent that it influences inflation, either directly via the prices of imported goods or indirectly via the business cycle.  Volatility of the Swiss franc against the euro has been negligible as of late. This relative calm should not, however, deceive us. It is not necessarily going to last. Experience has shown that phases of a weaker Swiss franc can be followed by periods in which the franc exhibits an upward trend. Financial market players and businesses should therefore be aware of the exchange rate risks they take. Monetary policy decision The inflation outlook forms the basis for the monetary policy decision. How does this look to us? As has already been pointed out in the considerations on the economic situation, there is likely to be an above-average utilisation of economic resources. The monetary analysis shows that lending is still growing vigorously and that the Swiss franc is trending relatively lower against the euro. Yet the inflation outlook remains favourable. The reasons are three-fold: First, falling oil prices will push inflation down considerably next year, at least during the first six months. Second, the opening of the labour market is making production more flexible, thereby exerting a favourable influence on inflation. Third, the National Bank lifted its interest rates at an early stage. The chief contribution of today's interest rate adjustment is to prevent resources from being over-utilised in 2007 and 2008. As a consequence, inflation is also likely to be muted in 2008 and 2009. 2 BIS Review 123/2006 
Inflation forecast graph The new inflation forecast is shown in the graph as a red dashed line. It covers the time span from Q4 2006 to Q4 2009 and depicts the inflation forecast on the assumption that the interest rate remains at 2.00% during this period of time. The dash-dotted green curve shows the inflation outlook published after the interest increase of September, which was based on a constant three-month Libor of 1.75%. The red line is clearly lower than the green one. This is partly due to falling oil prices and partly results from the dampening effect of today's interest rate increase. The level of inflation expected in 2007 is 0.4%. However, as is evident from the inflation dynamic, the effect of a 2.00% interest rate is still expansionary. Continuation of previous monetary policy With today’s decision to increase the three-month Libor by 25 basis points, we are adhering to our previous monetary policy course of gradual normalisation. In so doing, we are pursuing the goal of continuing to ensure long-term price stability. If the economy performs as expected, we will further pursue this strategy.

Inflation forecast of September 2006 with Libor at 1.75% and of December 2006 with Libor at 2.00%  The National Bank’s 100-year anniversary Ladies and Gentlemen, before concluding, I would like to say a few words on a completely different topic: The Swiss National Bank will celebrate it's 100-year anniversary in 2007. We are happy that we can celebrate this anniversary at a time when Switzerland’s economy is in good shape. And it is also with a certain sense of pride that we can look back upon a long phase of price stability. We will celebrate our anniversary in a festive, yet modest way. The 100th anniversary General Meeting of Shareholders on 27 April will, of course, be turned into a special event. On 13 June, at our traditional joint dinner before the news conference in Berne, we will take the opportunity to toast our centenary together with you. The highlight of the celebrations will be the launch of our commemorative publication on 21 June followed by the official ceremony in Zurich on 22 June. I look forward to welcoming many of you to these festivities. We will conclude our anniversary year with a two-day event for our staff in Berne on 25/26 August. Apart from these anniversary events, we will realise two special projects in 2007: the publication of historical time series and the launch of an internet platform on macroeconomic issues. The new statistical publication series comprises several booklets which will be published on a quarterly basis in the first year and then at irregular intervals. The topics presented cover the fields that were, or still are, significant for the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. The data series go back 100 years, where possible. The printed publications will contain annual figures, while additional data series and series with shorter intervals (quarterly, monthly, etc.) will be available on the internet. The publications also include commentaries on the data series, describing the calculation method and, for some topics, the historical and regulatory background. The first issue – dedicated to the monetary base and monetary aggregates – will be published in the first quarter of 2007. In autumn 2007, the SNB will launch Iconomix, an internet platform intended for public use. It will take visitors on a journey of discovery into the world of economics. The site "iconomix.ch" will contain teaching modules, highlighting various aspects of our daily life from an economic point of view. The modules are mainly designed to be used by senior secondary school students. In principle, however, the contents can be freely accessed by the public at large. By setting up this platform, the National Bank wishes to contribute to a better understanding of economic issues by a wider public.  4 BIS Review 123/2006 
Philipp Hildebrand: Risk management Introductory remarks by Mr Philipp Hildebrand, Member of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, at the end-of-year media news conference, Zurich, 14 December 2006. *      *      * As I have reported at a number of recent media conferences, the SNB has updated its investment policies for foreign exchange reserves over the past few years. I would like to take this opportunity to look back, once again, at our motives for these adjustments and to outline the context of conflicting objectives within which the investment policy of a central bank operates. I would like to devote special attention to risk management, which performs a key function in investment policy at the SNB. Looking at the current structure of our foreign exchange reserves, it is evident that we have moved a certain distance from the traditional structure of central bank portfolios. Traditional portfolios consisted almost exclusively of short-term government bonds in USD as well as, possibly, EUR or JPY. By contrast, we at the SNB have gradually diversified our currency risks over the past few years, have lengthened the maturities of our investments and invested in additional bond categories and in shares.  As a result of these adjustments, we are probably one of the most innovative central banks in the area of investments nowadays. However, I would like to stress the fact that we have never pursued innovation for its own sake. The adjustments are our response to a challenge that all central banks with a significant level of currency reserves will probably have to face, sooner or later. The challenge is to safeguard the protective function of currency reserves while simultaneously making use of their earnings potential. In simple terms, what is needed is first, to structure the reserves in a way that ensures their availability when overcoming any kind of monetary crisis, and second, to invest them in a way that ensures they will generate the highest possible returns. Returns must be generated, if only for the simple reason that earnings are needed to finance the necessary growth in currency reserves. Furthermore, we owe it to the public to manage our currency reserves in a professional manner.  The protective function of our currency reserves is fundamental. It is a direct corollary of the SNB mandate, in which monetary policy takes precedence over investment policy at all times. However, without questioning the primacy of monetary policy, there was still some leeway for greater management efficiency, particularly in the area of foreign exchange reserves. We have now exhausted a large portion of this room for manoeuvre. The first development that allowed us to take these steps was the 1997 revision of the National Bank Act. When the new Act came into force in 2004 the final statutory barriers with regard to permissible investment instruments were entirely removed.  However, in investment, as in all walks of life, the old adage applies: "There is no free lunch". Generally speaking, the better the earnings prospects, the higher the risk of losses. Certainly, the improved currency diversification was an extremely low-cost lunch for the SNB. Nevertheless, the introduction of additional investment classes and instruments, together with more active management of investments, brought new risks as well. Consequently, we have extended and enlarged our risk management activities in recent years, alongside the changes in our investment policies.  We now run a comprehensive risk management operation which is based on best-practice methods in the finance industry while also taking account of the special requirements of a central bank. We attach great importance to nurturing an appropriate risk culture, including ongoing identification, measurement, evaluation, limitation and monitoring of risks as well as timely, comprehensive reporting allowing for regular risk assessment and control. A key aspect is the fact that our risk management reports independently to the Governing Board and the Bank Council Risk Committee. This is also important because all operational functions in the area of investment policy are concentrated in one department for reasons of efficiency.  One of the special risks for a central bank is the fact that investment policies must not conflict with monetary policies. The liquidity requirements of monetary policy as well as the ability of investments to withstand crises are key parameters for investment strategy. Also, since we are unable to predict the timing of interventions or the volume of currency reserves that will be needed, we cannot resort to asset-liability approaches in our strategy definition process. Technically speaking, this means we cannot determine an optimal commitment period for our investments. In point of fact, our investment horizon is usually relatively long-term, although it can be abruptly shortened in the event of a crisis. Finally, we also pay special attention to reputation risks when engaging in specific investments. One of BIS Review 123/2006 1 
the SNB's most important assets is its good reputation and its credibility. Damage to its reputation could also have a negative impact on monetary policy. Consequently, in cases of doubt, we avoid investment classes and instruments that may be expected to have a damaging impact on our reputation. We are also very risk-conscious when it comes to potential conflicts of interest. For instance, all staff engaged in practical investment activities are shielded from confidential monetary policy information.  Effective risk management requires that all relevant risks be identified and assessed regularly, in a manner that is as unbiased as possible. Experience has shown that technical failure is seldom at the root of serious losses. The greatest losses result from a lack of risk consciousness, from a total failure even to recognise significant sources of risk. This danger exists when risk assessment is restricted exclusively to easily measurable quantitative risk variables, excluding areas such as processes or legal risks, which are referred to as 'operational risks'. For this reason, we also include operational risks in our assessment.  However, while pursuing this broader route, we certainly do not neglect the regular quantitative measures for assessing financial investment risks. No single key figure, taken alone, is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the risks involved. Therefore, our risk assessment is based on a range of key figures developed to measure risk, each of which has its own justification along with certain limitations.  In order to evaluate the overall risk of our investments, we use the value at risk method (VaR). Additional risk analyses are also necessary because of the method-related limitations of VaR (it provides no information about possible extreme losses; moreover it tends to underestimate the risk of large losses, particularly in times of low volatilities). We therefore conduct a number of additional stress and scenario analyses. For all of these risk calculations we take account of the SNB's tendency towards a long-term investment horizon. The methods used to assess and limit the risks linked to our active management of investments include the 'tracking error' method. This shows us the extent to which our actual investments deviate from the given benchmarks.  Our Risk Management unit has a complete and up-to-date picture of all investment positions. This is based on a dedicated IT solution which aggregates all positions from different supplier systems on a daily basis and evaluates them according to different criteria. This permits any critical developments to be identified in good time.  Within the bounds set by monetary policy, we work to achieve the greatest possible diversification of financial risks and to attain adequate compensation for the risks we enter into. In other words, we always assess the risks in conjunction with the expected benefit. One example of a poorly compensated risk, from the point of view of a Swiss franc investor, is the USD currency risk on bonds. Our experience has been that expected earnings on bonds in other currencies, such as euros or sterling, are comparable, while currency risks are significantly lower. Consequently, and also because another important reserve currency was available in the form of the euro, we have substantially reduced our share of USD investments over the past few years. Along with the expansion in the range of permissible bond classes and the addition of shares, the risk/return profile of our foreign exchange reserves has improved substantially. This has helped to ensure that results on foreign exchange reserves have remained positive for the past ten years. Naturally, part of the background to this development has been the favourable interest rate environment that has prevailed since the mid-1990s. Our analysis of the overall risk for all investments shows that the traditional risk factors such as the gold price and the dollar exchange rate continue to dominate. Gold poses the most substantial contribution to risk. By way of illustration: The gold price in terms of Swiss francs has fluctuated by over 10% in about half of the years that have elapsed since 1980. In terms of the SNB's annual result, this means that gold can be expected to contribute more than +/- CHF 3 billion to the result every second year. By comparison, the fluctuations in the value of foreign exchange reserves are more moderate.  The National Bank holds 1,290 tonnes of gold reserves. This means that, as the price of gold changes, the composition of the currency reserves changes in value terms – as does the risk profile of the currency reserves. In other words, a sizeable advance in the price of gold led to a substantial increase in the share of gold and thus also a significant rise in the risk that earnings would fluctuate. At the same time, our gold reserves represent a very special asset which, from a historical point of view, is likely to provide a crucial protective function in periods of extreme crisis. 2 BIS Review 123/2006 
What conclusions can we draw from these considerations? The 2004 revision of the National Bank Act gave the SNB more leeway in its investment policy. Since then, we have made use of this leeway within the bounds set by monetary policy, at least with respect to foreign exchange reserves. An essential prerequisite was – and remains – a risk management operation which is committed to best-practice methods and takes full account of the special features of a central bank in its considerations. The requirements of monetary policy will continue to have a strong impact on SNB investment policy in the future. The room for further improvements in the risk/return ratio is limited. As a result of their function, the currency reserves encompass large financial risks, while the comparable returns are relatively low. Compensation for the gold price risk and the dollar exchange rate risk, in particular, is relatively poor. It is therefore inevitable that tighter bounds will be set on SNB profit distribution, once the existing distribution reserve has been exhausted.  BIS Review 123/2006 3 
Lars Nyberg: The Riksbank's cooperation with Sida Speech by Mr Lars Nyberg, Deputy Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank, at a seminar arranged by Sida, Stockholm, 13 December 2006.  *      *      * Let me begin by thanking you for this opportunity to briefly describe the Riksbank’s work on aid issues. I would also like to say that it is particularly pleasing to see that the Nobel Peace Prize has this year been awarded to efforts in the financial sector in Bangladesh. Otherwise, the financial sector is often sadly forgotten in aid contexts. Foreign aid to developing countries often concentrates on combating poverty in all its forms, which is of course commendable. But it is easy to forget that a financial sector with functioning institutions is necessary to achieve long-term stable economic growth. A high inflation rate in one country may, for instance, quickly lead to greater poverty among large sections of the population than even the best type of poverty combating measures have time to counteract. A well-functioning central bank and responsible monetary policy can therefore make a significant contribution with regard to combating poverty. The Riksbank has cooperated with Sida for some years now in building up and reinforcing capacity within the central banks of Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Uganda. We do not call this foreign aid, but quite simply “Staff Exchange Programmes”. As all of the central banks in the world do more or less the same things, albeit in rather different ways, it is always rewarding to see how others work. We therefore send experts in various fields out to the countries with which we have this cooperation, for instance, experts who design payment systems or make models for inflation forecasting. The other central banks send their staff to us for further discussion of these issues or to talk about other things, such as how we deregulated the financial system in Sweden in the 1980s, or how important information and transparency are if one is to run a central bank with independent responsibility for monetary policy. Recently we have received some young employees who have stayed with us for periods of a month to six weeks on “internships”, where they can, for instance, learn how to write a financial stability report from scratch. Long-term thinking is a central concept of our programme. It takes time to understand one another’s reality and to create relationships that lead to cooperation based on mutual trust. We usually say it takes at least five years. Central bank governors are always involved in various ways (both here at the Riksbank and at the other central banks), which is important for giving the programmes adequate status. In our view, it is important that we are colleagues, not consultants. We are rarely able to stay longer than a week, as we have our own central bank to manage. We do not conduct large-scale investigations that we document and leave behind us; we describe our own experiences and allow our colleagues to consider whether these experiences may be of any use in their own work. We in Sweden and at the Riksbank have achieved quite a lot that has turned out well over the years, but we have also done a lot that we feel with hindsight could have been done better. For instance, we are proud of how we came through the bank crisis at the beginning of the 1990s, but not of how we got into it. This is the type of experience that no textbooks or courses can convey in the same way as people who were there when it actually happened. Our colleagues are usually interested in everything, but particularly in learning from others’ mistakes. We also consider it important that the Riksbank’s employees learn from the cooperation – that is one of the ideas behind a “Staff Exchange Programme”. Encountering activities that are similar to your own workplace’s, but are conducted under different external conditions always gives reason for consideration and reflection. Our programmes are therefore of great professional interest to our employees and most of them return from their trips with new and often unexpected experiences. Our cooperation with Sida has been excellent, although we sometimes hear that we have not spent as much money as expected. A few experts and their trips do not cost very much. The cooperation with the embassies is also very important. We have seen that the links to the central banks work best when the staff at the Swedish embassies in the respective countries are actively involved and regularly follow up what is happening in the respective banks. At the beginning of this year, Sida commissioned an evaluation of the Riksbank’s cooperation so far with Sri Lanka and Vietnam. The evaluation showed that the Riksbank’s efforts in these central banks had been both successful and appreciated by the recipients. The very fact that we are colleagues, that we do the same things, have the same responsibility, was one of the key factors. There are many BIS Review 123/2006 1 
consultants; colleagues are harder to find. The long-term thinking behind the cooperation is also an important factor. We do not merely make an analysis, write a report and disappear. We are still here and can continue the discussion whenever necessary. The problems that were indicated in the evaluation were more of an administrative nature. For instance, it is difficult to find a place in a foreign aid context for low-cost projects like this, as they do not really follow the set patterns for other aid efforts. Finally, I can mention that the Riksbank has allocated resources in our internal business plan for next year to extend our cooperation with some of the central banks in Sida’s cooperating countries. We consider that our work has been both interesting and rewarding and we hope that it has also helped some of our colleagues to make their own institutions stronger. 2 BIS Review 123/2006 
Nils Bernstein: Financial crises – talks in relation to financial stability in Denmark  Speech by Mr Nils Bernstein, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark, at the conference to mark the 125th anniversary of the first Danish savings bank act – the Savings Bank Act of 1880, Copenhagen, 12 September 2006.  *      *      * Thank you for inviting me to participate in the celebration of the 125th anniversary of the first Danish savings bank act. I have been asked to speak about Danmarks Nationalbank's tasks in relation to financial stability under the main heading of "Financial crises".  Financial crises can involve very serious costs. A survey by two economists, Hoggarth and Saporta, covering 43 financial crises in developed and developing countries shows that the average costs to society amounted to around 15 per cent of GDP. It can also be a costly affair to save one major bank in order to prevent economic collapse. A domestic case in point is the rescue plan to assist Landmandsbanken in 1922-23. It cost the Treasury kr. 40 million, and according to the historian Søren Mørch that was equivalent to 2/3 of the total government budget for social expenditure at the time. So, what are Danmarks Nationalbank's tasks in relation to financial stability?  If we go back to the Danmarks Nationalbank Act from 1936, it states that Danmarks Nationalbank shall "maintain a safe and secure currency system in this country, and [...] facilitate and regulate the traffic in money and the extension of credit".  There is thus no doubt that this is our task in relation to financial stability. However, the Act does not say how we should shoulder this responsibility. Perhaps that is just as well, since the task changes over time. At Danmarks Nationalbank we have defined financial stability as a state that exists:  when the financial system is robust enough for any problems experienced within the sector not to spread and prevent the financial markets from functioning as providers of capital and financial services.  In other words, the focus is on the functioning of the financial system. Smooth provision of money in our society is a prerequisite to a well-functioning Danish economy, but also the basis for effective implementation of a market-oriented monetary policy.  It is important to avoid problems in financial enterprises, not only for depositors and shareholders, but also for society at large. Problems within one bank tend to spread to other financial institutions – or at any rate to affect their reputation. Depositors and investors may loose faith in the financial system. A domino effect is created.  How does Danmarks Nationalbank actually solve its tasks in relation to financial stability? I would now like to show you some examples, and after that I will present a challenge.  Firstly, we seek to analyse the key risks to the financial sector. This includes situations that are very unlikely to arise, but which could potentially involve high costs to society. We perform stress tests on the financial system in order to calculate how large an adverse impact the existing buffers are able to absorb.  We publish these analyses in our annual Financial Stability report with a view to opening a dialogue with public authorities, banks and other sector representatives about risks to and developments within the financial sector. Some call this "open mouth" operations. On the basis of analyses and stress tests, our most recent Financial Stability report concluded that the financial institutions are still robust, and that there are currently no black clouds on the horizon that could threaten financial stability in Denmark.  We have become accustomed to seeing the banks make record-high profits every year. An important factor in this context is the high growth in lending; a rate of growth last seen in the mid-1980s.  As Chart 1 shows, the high-growth period in the mid-1980s was followed by a gradual erosion of credit quality, with increased losses and provisions in the subsequent period.  BIS Review 122/2006 1 
I am not saying that history will repeat itself. We should not forget that the new Basel II Capital Accord, which takes effect at the beginning of 2007, has increased focus on the banks' credit risk management.  When we at Danmarks Nationalbank assess the banks' credit risk, our starting point is a failure-rate model developed on the basis of 400,000 annual accounts filed by Danish companies in the period from 1995 to 2002. This model is similar to those used by the banks as a basis for the advanced methods that may be used under Basel II. The failure-rate model estimates the probability that a company will fail. As Chart 2 illustrates, our analysis based on the failure-rate model shows that there is a certain tendency for banks with high growth in lending in recent years also to have higher credit risk on their lending portfolios. There are exceptions, but we still need to be aware of the link between high growth in lending and the risk of subsequent higher losses.  Another topical issue we have examined is the large gross debt of Danish households compared to households in other countries. Chart 3 shows the debt as a ratio of GDP. The high gross debt ratio, combined with the extensive use of adjustable-rate mortgage-credit loans, makes the households more vulnerable to rising interest rates.  We have calculated the households' additional mortgage interest burden if interest rates rise. On average, mortgage interest expenses will increase by 1.2 per cent of the household's gross income if interest rates rise by 1 percentage point, but there are considerable variations. Some households will be financially challenged if interest rates increase by a few percentage points. This could impose losses on banks and mortgage-credit institutes. Nevertheless, our overall assessment is that the development in homeowners' exposure to rising interest rates does not threaten the functioning of the financial system – or financial stability. To put it bluntly, the failure of a number of households to meet their obligations to their credit institutions is not necessarily a financial stability problem.  In the past year, the IMF has visited Denmark in connection with its FSAP, Financial Sector Assessment Program. As in other member countries, the IMF assessed the structure of the Danish financial system. A report will be published within a month or so.  In connection with the FSAP a stress test was conducted to assess whether the Danish financial system is robust to cyclical changes. The basis for the stress test included Danmarks Nationalbank's macro model, MONA, and a stress test module that we have estimated. The worst-case scenario applied by the IMF involves a slowdown of the domestic economy, exacerbated by monetary-policy tightening by the ECB. House prices will fall by 30 per cent and GDP by 3 per cent over a 3-year period. A strong cocktail indeed.  The result of Danmarks Nationalbank's stress test is shown in Chart 4, where the blue line represents the actual, historical losses to the banks, while the yellow line shows modelled calculations of the historical development, and the broken line is the expected development, given the stress scenario. According to the calculations, the banks' average losses would increase to almost 1.5 per cent of loans and guarantees. This is somewhat lower than in the early 1990s, when losses and provisions reached 2.5 per cent on average. Overall, the Danish financial system is therefore reasonably robust. Nevertheless, a few banks may suffer substantially higher losses, just as there were banks in the early 1990s that lost more than 10 per cent.  Stress testing will be given higher priority in our future assessments of financial stability. Our ambition is to learn more about how the banks affect each other and the economy in stress situations.  Another task for Danmarks Nationalbank in relation to financial stability is to ensure that Denmark has a secure and effective financial infrastructure that can safely be used for settlement of payments, securities trading and other financial transactions. Danmarks Nationalbank now has a statutory obligation to oversee payment and settlement systems in Denmark.  Part of the IMF's FSAP was to assess the core elements of the Danish financial infrastructure in relation to international standards. The IMF recommended a few changes. Danmarks Nationalbank will work with those responsible for the systems to ensure that the necessary improvements are made. However, we will not blindly adhere to all recommendations.  For example, the IMF recommends that we establish a buffer pool to ensure the settlement of securities transactions and retail payments even if the largest participant is not able to settle its payment obligations. Danmarks Nationalbank finds that the best safeguard is to ensure that 2 BIS Review 122/2006 
participants have easy and flexible access to liquidity, combined with participants' large portfolios of securities that can be pledged as collateral for loans from Danmarks Nationalbank. Consequently, we do not currently see any need for special measures to ensure settlement in the Danish systems.  A third area that we are looking at is situations where the financial system is affected by dramatic external events. These could be acts of terrorism, widespread epidemics, natural disasters or other situations where the financial system threatens to collapse.  Danmarks Nationalbank chairs a task force to ensure coordination of the financial institutions' business continuity plans in such situations.  Finally, Danmarks Nationalbank acts as lender of last resort to the Danish banks. Danmarks Nationalbank can extend loans to a bank that urgently needs liquidity and cannot procure it in the market, even though the bank is solvent.  Fortunately, we are seldom called on to do that.  Should a situation occur where it is necessary to rescue an ailing bank, Danmarks Nationalbank's position is that a market-based solution should be found.  Nothing definite can be said beforehand about Danmarks Nationalbank's role. It would depend on a concrete assessment of the situation and the – direct or indirect – consequences for the Danish banking system and Danish society.  However, we can look at what Danmarks Nationalbank has done on previous occasions.  In a number of cases, Danmarks Nationalbank has played a role in connection with public intervention to help ailing banks – by providing financial assistance or expertise. Each time the situation has been so serious that it could potentially have a negative impact on the Danish banking system or cause foreign banks to lose faith in Danish banks.  The initial step has been to provide stand-by liquidity facilities so as to give the bank in question some room to manoeuvre. However, Danmarks Nationalbank has also provided guarantees to creditors jointly with the private banks – often on the basis of a government guarantee. In several cases, the involvement of Danmarks Nationalbank has been conducive to a solution with the participation of private banks. A classic example of our role as lender of last resort was an episode in the summer of 1992 when there were rumours that Unibank was facing difficulties. Since it was Denmark's second largest bank, it was certainly a bank that was of significance to the Danish banking system. The episode coincided with the banking crisis in the other Nordic countries and is mentioned in Danmarks Nationalbank's Report and Accounts 1992:  "Early in the summer, rumours arose that Unibank was facing difficulties. These rumours were immediately disproved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority, but in order to counter any liquidity problems abroad for Danish banks as a consequence of the rumours concerning a bank which did comply with the solvency requirements, the Nationalbank made a stand-by agreement with Unibank to supply liquidity if necessary, cf. the Nationalbank's press release of June 21, 1992." As we know, Unibank pulled through.  Finally, I would like to draw attention to a challenge that we are facing. In the banking area, financial integration is at a more advanced level in the Nordic region than in the rest of the EU, and most large banks have branches or subsidiaries in other Nordic countries. The most prominent example is Nordea, which has significant market shares in each of the Nordic countries (except Iceland) – in Denmark's case almost a quarter of all deposits.  EU legislation has contributed to harmonising the basis for conducting activities in the financial sector and removed barriers to cross-border operations. This is part of the process to create a single financial market in the EU.  Nordea currently operates with a subsidiary structure, so that the national authorities are still responsible for supervision and oversight of its activities in each country. For Nordea Danmark, this responsibility lies with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority.  This will change if Nordea – as announced some years ago – chooses to merge into one bank with branches in the various countries. In that case, the authorities in its home country – presumably Sweden – would have the principal responsibility for activities in Denmark, just as the Danish BIS Review 122/2006 3 
authorities currently supervise e.g. Danske Bank's activities in its Swedish branch. That is how the EU legislation is designed.  This legislation is suitable if a bank has a relatively small branch in another country.  However, the Swedish authorities cannot hold responsibility for Nordea's impact on financial stability in Denmark. It is still Denmark's responsibility that our financial system functions – even if we do not have insight into almost one quarter of the Danish banking market.  Consequently, Danmarks Nationalbank is of the opinion that where large branches are involved that may affect financial stability in another member state, we need more binding cooperation between the authorities of the home country and the host country than EU legislation provides for.  Both the supervisory authorities and the central banks in the Nordic countries have concluded collaboration agreements relating to cross-border financial enterprises. We have a long-standing tradition for Nordic cooperation, and presumably we will be able to negotiate the necessary insight into large Danish branches of banks domiciled in other Nordic countries, and vice versa.  However, the system should also be designed to handle business integration between north and south within the EU. In this respect, the tradition for cooperation is less well-established than among the Nordic countries. It may therefore be necessary to rethink the EU legislation so that the individual member states are still empowered to safeguard financial stability – even with the presence of large foreign branches whose operations may have an impact on the financial system. The EU needs a legal handle to ensure that the authorities of the host country gain the necessary insight into a large branch of a foreign bank.  The problem is naturally not acute, but amendments to EU legislation take their time, and we do not know when the need may arise. This is an issue that we will pursue in cooperation with other Danish authorities.  14-12-2006DANMARKS NATIONALBANK2Chart1.

Glenn Stevens: Finance and economic development in Australia Address by Mr Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia (CEDA) Annual Dinner, Melbourne, 12 December 2006. *      *      * It is a great pleasure to be invited to address the Annual General Meeting of CEDA, continuing a long tradition of such addresses by Governors of the Reserve Bank of Australia. CEDA – the Committee for Economic Development of Australia – began in 1960, an initiative of D.B. Copland. Copland, one of Australia’s most remarkable economists of the Depression era, was a member of ‘Giblin’s Platoon’, whose history is recorded so nicely in the recent book of that name.1 CEDA has over the years made a substantial contribution to debate in a number of fields, from trade policy to taxation policy, from indigenous affairs to infrastructure. Interestingly enough, the list of publications on CEDA’s website does not include any which are overtly financial in their focus. I do not say this as a criticism – perhaps the reason you have invited central bank governors to speak so regularly is to cover that very set of issues! But it seems appropriate, given CEDA’s core focus on economic development, to address the questions: what is the role of finance in economic development and growth? How does the financial system contribute? How can financial events sometimes be detrimental to economic growth? What can be done to ameliorate those risks? What risks do we face at present? History The growth we take for granted in the modern world is actually a fairly recent phenomenon in human history. Prior to the industrial revolution in western Europe, living standards rose, if at all, very slowly. According to Angus Maddison’s data, the real per capita GDP of the United Kingdom rose between 1500 and 1820 at an average rate of only 0.27 per cent per annum.2 At that pace, living standards doubled about every 250 years. In other words, a person would not live all that much better than their grandparents – assuming they could discern any difference. From 1820 to 1913, the rate of increase rose to 1.15 per cent. That’s a very big change. At that pace, living standards doubled in about 60 years. In the 20th century – despite wars, the Great Depression, the Great Inflation and various other problems – growth per head rose further. Australia’s per capita growth was 1.70 per cent in the 20th century, according to the same data set, for a doubling in living standards about every 40 years. The difference between my living standards and those of my grandparents in the mid 1940s when they were as old as I am now – a trebling – is remarkable. There is a vast literature on what accounts for this growth, and there has been a long debate in economics about whether the development of financial institutions and markets followed or led the developments in the real economy. Some, such as Joseph Schumpeter, Sir John Hicks and Walter Bagehot argued that financial development actively fostered innovation and entrepreneurship. Others, including Joan Robinson, argued that finance passively followed in the wake of real-side development.3  Surely both components were necessary, and neither alone would have been sufficient. Technological advance provided the potential for a marked acceleration in productivity. In the early age of industrialisation, the steam engine and electricity were two obvious examples. Without those opportunities, such financial capital as was available for deployment would probably have struggled to find a useful outlet.                                                       1  Coleman, W., S. Cornish and A. Hagger (2006), Giblin’s Platoon: The Trials and Triumph of the Economist in Australian Public Life, ANU E Press, Canberra. 2  Maddison, A. (2003), The World Economy: Historical Statistics, OECD, Paris. 3  For a treatment of these issues, see Levine, R. (1996), ‘Financial Development and Economic Growth: Views and Agenda’, The World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 1678. BIS Review 122/2006 1 
But equally, the potential technological advance would have remained just that – potential, rather than actual – had there not been a capacity to mobilise the financial resources needed to invest in the equipment embodying the new technology. The capital required for an economy based on agriculture and artisan-based manufacturing had been in the form of land, seed, basic tooling and the like. Traders needed working capital in order to purchase goods in one place and move them to another for sale, and various financial devices arose to assist this. The need to sink very big sums into large-scale machinery, however, called for capital on a different scale, and financial development was key to providing it.  The economic historians suggest that a number of innovations were important. The development of the limited liability corporate structure allowed proprietors to take risk without facing complete personal ruin if the venture failed. Banking corporations efficiently pooled the resources of a large number of savers, the more so as they developed into joint-stock ownership structures, as opposed to purely private ones. These organisations also provided, before central banks developed fully, circulating monetary assets for the community, which facilitated exchange. Markets for the trading of claims against future income flows – what today we know as stock and bond markets – allowed the providers of capital to retain their wealth in a more liquid form, thus encouraging them to commit more capital to long-term ventures. In other words, the development of financial markets and institutions was an integral part of the industrial revolution. It remains a key facilitator of the growth we enjoy today. Yet such progress was not without its occasional problems, in the form of periodic panics. Commodities markets had a certain tendency towards occasional instability. Optimism and greed could push prices to extreme levels, following which a loss of confidence typically precipitated a crash. The Dutch tulip bubble of the 1630s occurred without the aid of the highly developed set of financial intermediaries that came later, though it did achieve considerable added fizz via a futures market for tulip bulbs – derivatives allow leverage, which is almost always a key element of the latter stages of speculative manias.4  But the growth of a modern banking system in England by the late 18th century, whose liabilities were effectively financial claims against assets that could not be quickly realised if suddenly called, brought heightened risks. Banking is, after all, a business that involves leverage and liquidity and credit risks. There was always the possibility of a financial panic that could, if unchecked, threaten not only the financial institutions but also the course of the real economy. The question facing public policy, then, was how to find a set of arrangements that would allow the necessary credit extension to support capital investment in pursuit of new technological opportunities, yet provide a stable monetary standard and a financial system in which the public could have confidence. We should record that in the same era, questions of a qualitatively similar nature arose in the fledgling colonies of the Antipodes, even if they were, to begin with, at a lower level of sophistication. The Colonies needed both a system of mobilising capital and a means of making payments other than circulating paper claims over goods – be it rum or something else. We are all aware of Governor Macquarie’s ingenious attempt in 1813 at keeping metallic money in the colony of New South Wales, by making two coins out of each Spanish dollar, thus rendering them at once more useful in New South Wales and much less useful elsewhere. But Macquarie’s initiatives in granting a charter to the Bank of New South Wales in 1817, and those of Governor Darling in rescuing it from disaster in 1826, were perhaps more important milestones in the early financial development in this country. According to Trevor Sykes’ account,5 both of these actions were contrary to the policy of the British Government. These appear to have been occasions when the lags in implementation of official policy – measured by the time taken for a request for instructions to reach London by sailing ship, be considered and then answered by return ship, too late to influence the decision – helped to produce a superior outcome! Around the world, governments groped towards a sustainable solution for combining the benefits of financial intermediation with stability. Progress was not necessarily always steadily in the right direction,6 but one of the key developments was the gradual evolution of the institution we would today                                                       4  See Sykes, T.

Robinson (eds), Asset Prices and Monetary Policy, Proceedings of a Conference, Reserve Bank of Australia, Sydney, pp. 194–202. 5  See Chapter 1 of Sykes, T. (1988), Two Centuries of Panic, Allen & Unwin, Sydney. 6  Rondo Cameron, for example, in claiming that the British financial system contributed to the industrial revolution between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries, argues that this contribution was in spite of, rather than as a result of, policy actions of 2 BIS Review 122/2006 
recognise as the central bank. In a number of countries, these institutions had begun life as a means to finance military expeditions by governments of not altogether unquestioned creditworthiness,7 but they gradually became central players in the efforts to foster stability in normal times, and to restore it after something went wrong. Bagehot’s classic, Lombard Street,8 remains one of the best accounts of this in the case of the Bank of England. The notion of the lender of last resort, and the idea that the central bank should look to the interests of the system rather than any commercial interest of its own, were slowly developing. It was, of course, to be some time before the central bank had fully evolved into the current form, even in the most advanced economies. In our own case, the central bank did not really have a fully developed public policy mandate until after the 1930s, and arguably was not a purely policy institution until the separation of the Reserve Bank from the Commonwealth Bank in 1960. Through the 20th century, of course, views about the appropriate role of a central bank changed a good deal, as did views about the appropriate extent of official intervention in financial markets and institutions generally. The Great Depression of the 1930s occasioned new ideas about macroeconomic policy, which envisaged more official intervention in economic matters. This was followed by a very large increase in the government sector’s command over economic and financial resources, of necessity, to conduct the Second World War. Hence by the end of the 1940s, the landscape had changed a great deal in comparison with 1930. The financial systems of many countries found themselves subject to much more regulation, and central banks with more regulatory powers and more explicit mandates for macroeconomic stabilisation, than had previously been the case. Initially, this arrangement held great promise. The instability of the 1930s had apparently been banished. But as time went by, other problems emerged. As explained eloquently by Ian Macfarlane’s recent Boyer Lectures, macroeconomic policies became overly ambitious, and neither the policy frameworks nor the governance arrangements under which they were implemented were up to the challenges posed by the shocks of the 1970s. Nor, we might add, was the structure of financial regulation, with its emphasis on governments or central banks setting most financial prices and even seeking to decide who should and should not receive credit. Many of us here will recall the debates at the time of the Campbell Inquiry in the late 1970s. By then, the problems of the extensive regulatory regime had become all too clear. It was ineffective (or even counterproductive) at a macroeconomic level, it distorted resource allocation at a microeconomic level and it fostered the rapid development of a more dynamic financial sector operating beyond the regulatory net. This wasn’t sustainable, and something had to give. There was large-scale liberalisation of the financial sector through the 1980s, winding back many of the post-Depression, World War II era restrictions. Efforts at prudential supervision were beefed up, but these progressively became focused on ensuring adequate risk management in individual financial institutions rather than the more direct controls of the earlier era. In more recent times, financial system stability – as distinct from the solvency of individual institutions – has become more prominent as an explicit focus of central banks, many of which publish regular detailed assessments of system stability.9 This is a natural response to the circumstances, but it is really a refocusing on one of the key original purposes of the central bank. All of that history is a backdrop to the financial trends of the past decade, to which I now turn.                                                                                                                                                                       the British governments of the day. He writes: ‘At almost every point at which banking and monetary policy might have been used constructively to promote economic growth, the authorities either made the wrong decision or took no action at all.’ See Cameron, R. (1967), (ed.) Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History, Oxford University Press, New York, p. 58. 7  For example, the Bank of England was granted its charter – establishing it as Britain’s first limited liability banking entity – in 1694 after raising £1.2 million for the Government to fund expenditure in the war with France. 8  Bagehot, W. (1873), Lombard Street: A Description of the Money Market, Henry S. King and Co., London. 9  It is not mere coincidence, by the way, that this came at the same time as the macroeconomic instability concerns of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s receded. Better macroeconomic stability has coincided with, and in all probability encouraged, a dramatic increase in the size and complexity of financial activity. BIS Review 122/2006 3 
Financial and economic trends in Australia in the past decade  The most prominent financial development of the past decade has, of course, been the change in the structure of the balance sheets of households. Much has been said about this and so any description here can be brief. The essence of the story is that in the early 1990s, two decades of chronically high inflation in Australia ended. Interest rates declined as a result. In fact, they returned to levels last seen in the low-inflation period in the 1960s. But in the intervening period, of course, the Australian financial system had changed out of all recognition, a result of liberalisation, competition and innovation. No longer was the potential borrower for housing on bended knee to a stern-faced bank manager, the way they had been in earlier periods of low rates. Now, lenders were under more competitive pressure to grow their balance sheets. Having pursued the corporate borrowers in the 1980s, with rather mixed success, they were now looking to households as a source of growth. We can all recall the advertisement for one major bank in which the formerly stern manager practises saying ‘yes’ in the mirror each morning. So by the mid 1990s, we had a household sector more able and more inclined to demand housing finance, and financial institutions more willing to supply it. It is hardly surprising that this should ultimately result in households carrying much more debt, as well as higher levels of assets, than they had before. It might have happened earlier had the course of inflation and interest rates been different. Nor is it surprising that such an expansion in finance over a relatively short period of years should be associated with higher prices for dwellings. I find persuasive the arguments that changes to planning and development regulations have raised the cost of new building – that is, the cost of adding to the dwelling stock. It is plausible that this, in turn, adds to the price of those existing dwellings that could reasonably be substitutes for new dwellings. But if we are seeking an explanation for why the prices of the 8 million existing dwellings across the country have increased so much, we surely have to give a very prominent role to the halving of the cost of debt and its easier availability. These trends also added to aggregate demand in the economy, via additional construction and renovation spending, and the generally expansionary impact of rising asset values on broader household spending. Whereas dwelling investment averaged around 5 per cent of GDP through the 1970s and 80s, it reached a peak of nearly 7 per cent of GDP in 2003/04. Households also expanded their consumption faster than their income. For a time, these trends were helpful in periods when adverse shocks from abroad were having their impact. Over the past two or three years, these effects gently faded. We have seen some decline in spending on housing, and a slowing in the growth of household borrowing and consumption spending, but these changes have been fairly modest compared with earlier episodes, partly because there are regions of the country where the resources boom has continued to boost house prices and household demand.  The run-up in household borrowing has also raised, on occasion, and quite naturally, questions about how sustainable all this was, and whether there was a build-up of exposures in the household sector and the financial system that could impair financial or macroeconomic stability at some future time. Considerable attention has been given over recent years to this set of questions, both in the Reserve Bank and elsewhere. We did not believe that the rise in debt was, in itself, likely to trigger an economic downturn. That said, higher leverage would, in the event of an economic downturn that occurred for some other reason, probably make at least some households’ spending behaviour more responsive to declines in income than it would have been in the past. Precisely this set of issues has recently been addressed as part of the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). That program was a very wide-ranging exercise, as all FSAPs are, but from our point of view a key component of it was a macroeconomic stress test. The Reserve Bank, through our Financial Stability Department headed by Keith Hall, co-ordinated this exercise, which involved the IMF team, APRA, the Australian Treasury and the risk-management areas of the five largest banks – for whose co-operation we express our thanks. The results were included in our September Financial Stability Review, and also released by the IMF as part of the FSAP report in October. In brief, the test involved a scenario featuring: a very large fall in house prices, a recession, a big rise in unemployment, a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate and a rise in the funding costs of financial institutions. This was designed specifically to test the resilience of the financial system when several of the key elements underpinning business strategies over the past decade were removed. 4 BIS Review 122/2006 
In such a scenario, only some of the adverse effects would come directly through mortgage portfolios; a good deal of it would come through business portfolios. Faced with a loss of income, indebted households would be likely to cut back consumption sharply in order to keep up their mortgage payments. Hence, businesses supplying into discretionary consumer markets would feel the effect quite quickly. In the tests conducted, the result was an estimated decline of around 40 per cent in the banks’ aggregate profits after around 18 months, and by the end of the three-year scenario, profitability remained 25 per cent lower than its starting point. That said, the institutions remained not only well and truly solvent but with capital positions above regulatory minima. In part, this reflected the strength of business balance sheets. As the banks worked through the scenario, this strength meant that the significant cutback in household spending did not cause widespread loan defaults in the business sector. Overall, the results are, within the limitations of this type of exercise, reassuring. Before we take too much comfort from them, however, we need to enter a few caveats. For a start, while the scenario seems a demanding one at first blush, it is predicated on a recession in Australia but not in the rest of the world. That would be, if not unprecedented, at least very unusual, and a more realistic scenario in which Australia suffered a downturn simultaneously with, and largely as a result of, an international downturn could well be a more challenging environment than the one assumed for the tests. A second factor is that everyone taking part in the simulation knew that the scenario involved an economic recovery, by assumption. They could factor that into their modelling. But in a real recession, there always comes a point at which many people are not confident of recovery, and that affects their behaviour. It is not unknown for lenders to be sufficiently lacking in confidence that they are reluctant to take on the risk of new borrowers. That would feed back to the economy, deepening the decline and slowing the recovery. Thirdly, there were quite large differences in results across banks. While these differences may be partly explained by variations in the structure of individual bank balance sheets, they also appear to reflect different approaches used by the banks to model their outcomes. There is nothing wrong with that – it is not that one approach is definitely right and another wrong. But the fact that varying techniques can produce significantly different results means that there must be a fair bit of uncertainty around any individual estimate. Hence, while the results provide some comfort, we can have only limited confidence that they would be replicated in a real-world downturn. We are, however, confident that the exercise was worthwhile, and would be worth doing again at some point. The Council of Financial Regulators, a body that brings together APRA, ASIC, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank under the chairmanship of the RBA Governor, is of the view that system-wide stress testing should be conducted on a regular basis, though of course the scenario would need to change through time. This was also the view of the IMF in its FSAP report. We have indicated to the CEOs of the participating banks that we would look to do this type of stress test roughly once every two years, and I look forward to their support for this.  Looking ahead, the increasing prominence of private equity and leveraged buyout activity will be a point of interest. To date, this trend has probably caused a bit more excitement than the straight numbers would suggest is warranted, since LBOs accounted for a relatively small proportion of corporate mergers and acquisitions of Australian companies in 2006. But perhaps the reason for the attention is the feeling that the trend could continue for some time. In essence, many of these transactions are based on two fundamental premises: the return on equity is high, and has in recent years been unusually stable as well; and the cost of debt is low. Those offering high prices for businesses are essentially betting that, over the next several years, they can enhance returns by increasing leverage. To some extent, they may also feel that in a private-ownership structure they can do some things to improve long-run performance of the company that current shareholders would not tolerate because of short-term damage to earnings and share prices. But mainly, the strategy is one of leverage. If this analysis is correct, then corporate leverage, and the associated exposures around the financial system, could be rather more prominent as an issue over the next five years or so than it has been for a couple of decades. Going back to the FSAP stress tests for a moment, it is likely that the results would have been more worrying had the leverage of the corporate sector been considerably higher. But we shall have to leave a more detailed discussion of such issues to another occasion. For now, it is time to conclude. BIS Review 122/2006 5 
Conclusion Finance and growth go together. It was no accident that the acceleration in growth in the industrial revolution was associated with the development of modern banking and capital markets. By the same token, disruption to the financial sector is costly to the real economy, as is only too clear in history. The role of public policy is to respond to these disruptions forcefully if and when they occur to preserve the stability of the system, but in the good times to work hard at fostering a climate of careful risk assessment in the relevant institutions and markets. For the past 15 years or so, the financial system in Australia has worked remarkably smoothly to assist the economy. A very large change in the household sector’s balance sheets has made households more sensitive to changes in their circumstances, but financial institutions have continued to perform strongly. The challenge remains for these institutions, and all of us, to understand how risk is changing in this new environment, and to remain aware that we may at some stage face less forgiving circumstances than we have enjoyed over the past decade. We need also to be alert to the shift in the wind in the area of corporate leverage that seems to be occurring. I suspect we will be talking about that for some time to come.  In the interim, I wish all of you a merry Christmas and a happy, prosperous – and stable – new year. 6 BIS Review 122/2006 
Jens Thomsen: European bond markets before and after the euro Speech by Mr Jens Thomsen, Member of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of Denmark and Chairman of the EFC-subcommittee on EU Government Bonds and Bills Markets, at the European Government Bond Summit, Brussels, 25 October 2006. *      *      * My remarks will focus on reflections related to the integration process that the European bond markets has experienced in the post-EMU era. In particular, I will highlight the successful evolution of European government bond markets following the introduction of the common currency. The establishment of the European Monetary Union on January 1, 1999, paved the way for a more integrated European bond market. In the pre-EMU era, different euro area countries' government bond yields differed substantially. As an example, yield spreads against Germany in the 10-year government bond segment ranged up to 700 bp in the 1990's (see slide 1). Yield spreads were however expected to decline along with the introduction of the euro primarily due to the elimination of exchange rate risk. Prior to 1999, attempts were made to anticipate the magnitude of the post-1999 yield spreads between EMU member states. Sparsely evidence from other currency areas provided some insight in relation to such anticipations. The provincial bond market in Canada was one such candidate area to use for comparison as the Canadian provinces had some similar characteristics to the forthcoming EMU countries, including no explicit rules for mutual or federal bail out. The spreads between bonds issued by different Canadian provinces and Canadian government bonds were much lower than euro area spreads prior to the euro ranging "only" up to 60 bp. Notwithstanding declining spreads, the Canadian evidence indicated that the euro area spreads would not completely disappear (see slide 2).1Considering the post-1999 era in retrospect, the euro area spreads have indeed declined significantly since the introduction of the euro (see slide 3). In fact, euro area spreads are small today and actually lower than the ones observed between Canadian provinces. This may be due to a higher level of liquidity in the EMU countries' issues as well as somewhat better credit ratings among EMU countries. Regarding the credit ratings, they may be influenced by the generally larger tax bases of central governments in addition to lower labour mobility in Europe which causes tax bases to be more secure. The convergences of yields among euro area countries have not yet been observed as markedly for the 10 new EU member states even though ERM2 members clearly have experienced lower spreads (see slide 4, Lithuania and Slovakia are ERM2 members). The large decline in the euro area yield spreads reflects the increasing integration of European fixed income market that has taken place since 1999. The market integration process can be viewed from four dimensions. Firstly, the fact that the European government bond market consists of many issuers contrary to the corresponding US market implies that the European market is more divided per se. However, the development of a comprehensive network of electronic trading platforms has mitigated this issue, i.e. the predominant part of the EMU issuers is today connected by the same system (see slide 5). Secondly, the establishment of primary dealer networks in all EMU countries has, among other things (e.g. securing liquidity), enhanced the integration of the bond market. A quick glance at various EMU countries' lists' of official primary dealers, shows that a large part of primary dealers are present in almost every government bond market, indicating a high level of market integration across countries (see slide 6). Thirdly, a harmonization of market conventions as well as national tax treatments has occurred since the introduction of the euro. E.g. conventions in government bonds and T-bills markets concerning settlement date, definition of business days and day count basis, coupon frequency and coupon calculation methods are almost completely harmonized across euro area countries today (see slide 7                                                       1  See "Yield Differentials in the Future EMU", Monetary Review, May 1997, Danmarks Nationalbank, for a pre-1999 analysis of expected EMU spreads based on evidence from Canadian provinces. BIS Review 122/2006 1 
and 8). This has made the European fixed income market more transparent and accessible for international investors. Fourthly, product development has also contributed to the market integration process. For example the euro-denominated interest rate swap (IRS) market has grown to become the largest in the world in absolute terms. In relative terms, the euro-denominated IRS market is today about twice the size of the USD-denominated IRS market (see slide 9). As a result of the very liquid IRS market, fixed income instruments across the euro area are today typically priced using the standardized euro swap curve in combination with yield curves stemming from heterogeneous government bonds. Consequently, the euro-denominated IRS market has obtained a similar benchmark role as the one held by US treasuries in the USD-denominated market, with respect to the pricing of fixed income instruments. The emergence of a liquid swap curve has thereby served to further alleviate the issue of fragmentation in the European fixed income. The small yield spreads that still exist today between EMU member states are primarily attributable to differences in liquidity and credit risk between issuers. Consequently, the EMU era has drawn more attention to these two factors. Regarding credit risk, increased focus may have served to increase the disciplinary effect of the financial markets on policy makers. An inspection of the relationship between the development of national debt-to-GDP ratios and sovereign yield spreads relative to Germany 1999 – 2006, indicates that the improved creditworthiness of the EMU member states since 1999 can explain some of the decline in the spreads (see slide 10). However, credit risk is only one of the factors that determine the size of the spreads and should therefore not be viewed in isolation. In order to examine the role of respectively credit risk and liquidity embedded in the current yield spreads across EMU countries, one may use prices on credit default swaps (CDS) to split up the yield spread between credit risk and liquidity. The fact that the price of a CDS approximately equals the credit risk premium of the underlying bond makes this possible. Under the assumption that the yield spread between the EMU-members purely can be explained by differences in credit risk and liquidity, the liquidity risk premium may be defined as the residual of the yield spread after deducting the credit risk premium (see slide 11). The calculation shows that the yield spreads today only are affected noticeable by credit risk for Greece, Italy and Portugal, whereas liquidity primarily plays a role for the smaller issuers. In addition to the government bond market, the introduction of the euro also formed expectations concerning a development of the euro-denominated corporate bond market. Though this market has increased fairly much in terms of total outstanding in the post-1999 period, the corporate bond market continues to account for a small fraction of the euro-zone debt market (see slide 12). Corporate finance traditions in Europe favouring the banking model may be one explanation for this. It should be recognised that well developed mortgage markets make a strong contribution to debt security markets in a number of European countries. Nevertheless, an increasing number of entities outside the euro-zone issue bonds denominated in euro. Indeed, the role of the euro in the international debt security markets has increased substantially since 1999. For broadly defined international debt securities (i.e. securities either issued outside the respective currency area or issued within the currency area and targeted at the international financial markets), the euro account for a global share of 47 percent compared with a share of 37 percent for the US dollar. The euro's share has risen by 18 percentage points since January 1999. The high share of the international market compared to the size of the national segment reflects the high relative importance of the international financial markets for the euro (see slide 13). The establishment of well functioning European government bond markets is an important contribution to the European single market supporting an efficient allocation of resources and economic growth. The contribution from the government bond market in the euro area should therefore not be underestimated. 2 BIS Review 122/2006

David Dodge: Improving financial system efficiency – the need for action Remarks by Mr David Dodge, Governor of the Bank of Canada, to the Economic Club of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, 11 December 2006. *      *      * Two years ago, I gave a speech here in Toronto in which I dealt with the theme of efficiency as it relates to the economy in general and to the financial system in particular. Today, I want to return to the theme of financial system efficiency. In doing so, I will draw on material from our latest Financial System Review (FSR), published last week.1 This publication, for those of you not familiar with it, is one way that the Bank contributes to the soundness of the financial system. The FSR reports on developments and trends in financial systems here and abroad, summarizes recent research by Bank staff on financial sector policies, and promotes discussion of how to strengthen our financial system. In short, the goal of the FSR is to improve financial system efficiency and stability. When I spoke two years ago, I stressed that all of us need to keep in mind the goal of efficiency, and that Canadian financial institutions and markets need to be as efficient as possible. Since that time, the global financial services sector has continued to undergo sweeping changes. The integration of global financial markets is continuing. Exchanges and financial institutions are consolidating, and new financial instruments are constantly being developed. All of this is changing the way that global markets operate, with important implications for the competitiveness and efficiency of Canadian markets and institutions. Today, I want to talk about how Canada has been responding to these developments. In doing so, I hope to underline just how important efficiency is for everybody who is concerned about Canada's long-term economic health.  But before I begin, I should start by saying why financial system efficiency is so important. When a financial system is operating at peak efficiency, investors receive the highest risk-adjusted returns on their investments, and borrowers minimize the costs of raising capital. With an efficient financial system, economic resources are allocated to the most productive investments. Another key reason to promote efficiency in the financial system is the importance of the financial sector to the industrial base. The financial services sector represents more than 6 per cent of Canada's GDP. However, the long-term health of this sector may be at risk unless we all act to increase its efficiency and competitiveness. I'll return to this topic in a few minutes. But the point I want to stress now is that an efficient financial system is crucial for achieving sustained economic growth and prosperity in Canada.  Efficiency and macroeconomic policies Let's examine how Canada's macroeconomic policies support efficiency. As a central banker, I will start with a brief look at monetary policy; in particular, our policy of inflation targeting. As you may know, last month the Bank and the Federal Government renewed our joint inflation-targeting agreement for another five years, until the end of 2011. Since Canada adopted inflation targeting, we have seen a number of important economic benefits. Inflation has been lower and more stable, and inflation expectations have become well anchored on the 2 per cent target, not just in the short term, but also in the long term. With this low and stable inflation, along with other important policy improvements, the peaks and valleys of the business cycle have become less pronounced, and the economy has shown increased flexibility in adjusting to various types of shocks. Because consumers and businesses have greater certainty about the future purchasing power of their savings and income, borrowers pay a much smaller premium to compensate investors for inflation risk. In short, we have seen lower costs for borrowers, more predictable returns for investors, and a more efficient allocation of resources. But we should always be looking to see if there are ways to make good performance even better. This is why the Bank is launching a concerted research program to see if our already very successful inflation-targeting framework can be improved. In particular, we want to find answers to two questions. First, what would be the costs and benefits of an inflation target lower than 2 per cent? Second, what                                                       1  Available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/fsr/index.htmlBIS Review 121/2006 1 
would be the costs and benefits of replacing the current inflation target with a longer-term price-level target? We hope to see intensive research on these issues, conducted both inside and outside the Bank, over the next three years. This would give the Bank and the Government of Canada enough time to examine the results and take them into account before the next renewal of our agreement in 2011. Canada's fiscal policies have been, and will continue to be, important in supporting the efficiency of markets. Governments, both federal and provincial, have worked hard to achieve fiscal balance and are now working to further reduce their ratios of public debt to GDP. Continued progress on this front will support efficiency by allowing investors to remain confident that the proceeds of their investments will not be subjected to excessive taxation in the future. This additional confidence can lead to better allocation of resources. A well-functioning market for federal debt is also important for Canadian fixed-income markets in supporting the efficient allocation of resources. So the Bank, in its role as fiscal agent for the government, will continue to work with the federal government and with market participants to support liquidity and the smooth functioning of markets for government debt.  Finally, the Bank of Canada supports efficiency through our role in promoting a safe and sound financial system. We do this both through our legislated responsibility to oversee systemically important clearing and settlement systems, and through our responsibility - one that we share with federal and provincial agencies, regulators, and market participants - to actively foster the safety and soundness of the financial system. When everyone is confident that the financial system is safe, there is less need either to keep precautionary resources or to spend on arrangements to guard against the effects of financial instability. Canada's clearing and settlement systems have been judged to be very sound.2 In addition, they have been designed to operate using a relatively small amount of liquidity compared with systems in other countries. And this frees up resources that can be put to more productive use elsewhere.  Our main goal in this area is to guard against costly financial instability. Recently, there has been discussion in the United States and the European Union about the potential threat to financial stability posed by hedge funds. As my colleague David Longworth pointed out in a recent speech3, we at the Bank have looked at the effect of hedge funds on the stability of markets, in particular, markets in Canada. It is important that central banks and others continue to monitor hedge funds for potential systemic risks. But in our judgment, there appears to be no reason to sound the alarm at this time. This is not to say that increased transparency by hedge funds might not improve the efficiency of markets, and that additional disclosure might not increase investor protection. These issues are being examined by securities commissions and others.  So, to sum up the macroeconomic side, the frameworks for our monetary, fiscal, and financial stability policies are second to none in the world, and do their job to support and encourage efficiency. But on their own, sound macroeconomic policies are not enough. Canada also needs microeconomic policies that spur competitiveness and support efficiency. Let me now review a few of these structural issues. I'll begin by talking about financial institutions, then address issues of efficiency in securities markets, enforcement, pension regulation, and fixed-income markets. Efficiency and microeconomic policies Financial institutions When I raised the topic of financial institution efficiency two years ago, I noted that following the 1964 Porter Commission, Canada became a world leader in terms of modernizing regulation. Parliament passed legislation creating a regulatory framework for financial institutions that led to greater competition, lower costs, and improved efficiency. Over the years, with the right policies in place, Canadian financial institutions capitalized on the comparative advantage provided by our regulatory framework to become world leaders in efficiency.                                                       2  See, for example, the IMF's assessment at http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/can/payment.htm3  Available at: http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/speeches/2006/sp06-18.html2 BIS Review 121/2006 
But over roughly the past decade, several countries have greatly improved their regulatory frameworks, eroding our comparative advantage. A number of foreign institutions have become better placed than before to exploit new technologies in order to enhance efficiency, and to offer their clients new instruments and combinations of services. It is in this rapidly-changing environment that our financial institutions must compete. Clearly, if we want our financial institutions to remain a major economic driver in Canada, then we need to make sure that the regulatory framework under which they operate encourages competition and innovation, and does not prevent them from maximizing efficiency. As the Minister of Finance said in his economic update, "Competition drives firms to become more efficient, invest in new technologies, and introduce new products and services that benefit consumers." This leads to the question of whether our financial institutions are efficient. Some observers have examined our financial services sector as a whole, using the data in the national accounts, and have noted that the productivity of this sector appears to be lower than that of other countries, particularly the United States. For us in Canada, where improving productivity is an increasingly important issue, such an assessment should be a concern. So, at the Bank of Canada, we are looking carefully at this issue. While our work is not complete, we did publish some of the initial findings in the current FSR.4 At the risk of oversimplifying, I will stress two main findings. The first is that in terms of net operating income per worker and assets per worker, employees of Canadian banks are at least as productive as their counterparts in U.S. banks of comparable size. Canadian banks also do well in some other measures of efficiency. But the second main finding is that, compared with U.S. banks, there are unexploited economies of scale for Canadian banks. This suggests that Canadian banks are less efficient with regard to the scale of their operations and if banks could reap economies of scale, there would be efficiency benefits to flow through to the Canadian economy. Overall, our research concluded that legislative and regulatory changes have benefited efficiency in Canadian financial services. This shows the importance of removing any remaining restrictions that inhibit competition and efficiency, but provide little or no benefit in terms of financial soundness. Our findings are still preliminary, and so far the research has been confined to banks. But as data become available, we plan to complete this research and extend it to other parts of the financial sector. Securities markets Now let me turn to the need to support efficiency through the regulation of securities markets. In the past, I have suggested that Canada would be best served by developing securities regulations that take into account the size and complexity of the firm doing the reporting. The principles of Canada's regulatory framework must apply to all firms, and must be as good as, or better than, those of any other country. But the application of the rules can, and should be tailored appropriately to take into account the size and complexity of the company. Historically, Canada's public markets have done well in funding smaller companies efficiently. It is important for the future of our markets that this continue. Canada should try to develop a comparative advantage in securities regulation for these smaller firms if it is to remain a market of choice for companies, both Canadian and foreign. The United Kingdom has made major strides in this area by consolidating its regulatory authorities ten years ago and, more recently, by beginning to implement a principles-based set of rules that simplifies administrative processes for issuers. Authorities in the euro area are moving to unify their regulatory regimes. Even in the United States, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has called for a streamlining of U.S. regulatory authorities. Against this backdrop, we in Canada increasingly look as if we are stuck in the middle of the 20th century, and are not positioning ourselves well to compete in the 21st century. For the sake of efficiency, we need a single, uniform framework for securities regulation. Rules need to be applied in a uniform way across the country, and tailored to be appropriate for firms of all sizes, while providing appropriate protection for investors.                                                       4  J.

The need for improved enforcement Let me turn now to enforcement. Markets work more efficiently when they operate under clear, transparent, and reasonable rules and principles. But even the best rules won't help if they are not enforced. While we have seen some first steps to strengthen enforcement over the past couple of years, there still is a perception, both in Canada and abroad, that Canadian authorities aren't consistent in their efforts to enforce the rules against insider trading and other offences, nor tough enough in rooting out and punishing fraud.  The Investment Dealers Association's Task Force to Modernize Securities Legislation, chaired by Tom Allen, has recently argued that information should be made more readily available to - and shared more readily by - investigators and prosecutors, and that training for these groups should be improved. A federal-provincial working group was recently formed to address these issues. But we cannot lose any momentum in this area. It's vital that we move quickly and forcefully to strengthen enforcement, so that investors and firms are confident that everyone is playing by the rules. I recognize that improving enforcement will require considerable effort and extensive co-operation among prosecutors, the police, securities commissions, and industry groups. But we can't lose sight of the fact that this will pay off in the long run. For example, at the Bank, we've put a great deal of effort into co-operating with law-enforcement agencies, and the justice system, to fight counterfeit currency. And while levels of counterfeits are still higher than we would like, we have seen a steady decline in the number of counterfeits detected since the beginning of 2004. Thanks to increased effort and co-operation, we're moving in the right direction. Pension regulation Pension regulation is another important issue for the efficiency of Canada's capital markets. There is a crucial need for a framework that provides the appropriate incentives for employers to establish and maintain pension plans, so that the vast pools of capital in these plans can make their maximum contribution to the efficiency of the Canadian economy. But our current regulatory framework instead provides a number of disincentives for firms to establish or maintain defined-benefit (DB) pension plans. These disincentives, along with recent low long-term interest rates, have led to increased solvency deficits among many defined-benefit plans. An update on the state of funding of DB pension plans is included in the current FSR.5 To address some of the problems facing DB plans, the federal and Quebec governments have introduced steps designed to help plan sponsors meet the solvency funding test by obtaining letters of credit. Other jurisdictions are also looking into these issues, including the Ontario Government, which has just launched an expert commission to review pension laws. The measures taken by the federal and Quebec governments will bring significant relief to some DB plans. But these are partial measures, and they do not address the fundamental disincentives faced by organizations sponsoring DB plans. It is important to get these incentives right, so that DB pension plans, which have a long-term investment perspective, can continue to grow. This long-term perspective fits well with Canada's need to finance the major investments in infrastructure that are essential for future economic growth. This match, between the need for investment in infrastructure and the need for pension funds to find long-term assets, seems perfectly suited to the private-public partnership model, or P3. But this match can't be made if governments do not have an appropriate framework for using P3s when looking at infrastructure improvements. There are still relatively few P3s in Canada, compared with countries that have a well-developed framework for P3 investments. In the June issue of our FSR, we looked at some of the constraints on the use of P3s in Canada.6  In summary, if capital markets are to make their maximum contribution to growth and provide financing for needed infrastructure, then action is essential both to reduce the disincentives for pension plan sponsors and to improve the framework governing private investment in public infrastructure.                                                       5  J.

Efficiency in fixed-income markets Finally, let me turn to developments specific to Canada's fixed-income markets. There has been progress in improving the efficiency of Canada's fixed-income markets, much of which stems from the decision taken by the federal government in 2005 to eliminate restrictions on the amount of foreign property that can be held in registered retirement and pension plans. The elimination of the Foreign Property Rule enhanced efficiency in a number of ways. First, it led to the development of the "Maple Bond" market. There is an article on this topic in the current FSR.7 With the removal of the Foreign Property Rule, foreign borrowers began to issue Maple Bonds, which are denominated in Canadian dollars and sold in the Canadian market. Foreign issuers have found Canadian investors eager for a product that allows them to diversify their fixed-income holdings geographically and by industry, and to earn higher risk-adjusted yields without taking on currency risk. This diversification makes the Canadian bond market more complete, and represents a better allocation of resources, thus increasing efficiency. Second, by increasing competition with domestic investments, the development of the Maple Bond market has led to pricing of other domestic corporate bonds that better reflects fundamentals. This improved pricing of risk benefits the Canadian financial system as a whole. Third, the development of the Maple Bond market has helped to increase trading and narrow spreads in the Canadian-dollar swap market. Since most foreign issuers don't have a natural need for Canadian dollars, the proceeds from the sale of Maple Bonds are typically swapped back into the home currency of the borrower. This additional activity has led to narrower spreads on cross-currency swaps, which also benefits domestic borrowers looking to raise funds abroad. In these three ways, the efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets has been improved. Other developments have also served to boost the efficiency of Canada's fixed-income markets. For example, we continue to see the growth of electronic trading systems that improve the functioning of markets, particularly fixed-income markets. It is crucial for any country that these markets function well, especially the markets for its government debt, and initiatives led by the private sector to increase transparency appear to be headed in the right direction for improving efficiency in this area. Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude. In my speech two years ago, I spoke about how Canada was once a world leader in terms of supporting efficiency. I talked about the 1964 Porter Commission, which came out strongly in favour of greater competition, freer markets, and effective regulation that served to enhance efficiency. Government, regulators, and the Bank of Canada responded positively to that report by acting to promote efficiency, and the private sector took advantage of new opportunities, leading to great benefits for the Canadian economy. Today, a similar effort is needed. While Canada's macroeconomic policies are second to none in supporting efficiency, our structural policies need work. We need to revisit the spirit of the Porter Commission and build regulatory frameworks that promote competition, innovation, and efficiency. In particular, we need action to support efficiency through the way that we regulate our financial institutions, securities markets, and pension funds. Equally importantly, we need action to improve the way we enforce our regulations. But improving efficiency is everybody's business. Once policy-makers do their job, it is up to the private sector to respond and take advantage of the opportunities to improve efficiency. The Bank of Canada remains committed to doing its part. If we all promote efficiency, then we all can reap the benefits of a more efficient financial system and a stronger economy in the future.                                                       7  J.

Radovan Jelašić: The development of small and medium size enterprises in Serbia Speech by Mr Radovan Jelašić, Governor of the National Bank of Serbia, during his visit to the enterprise “DOO PAVLE” PANCEVO, user of a loan under the credit line granted by the Italian government, Pančevo, 24 November 2006. *      *      * Ladies and Gentlemen,  The outstanding performance of this enterprise is the best example of what can be achieved when a powerful private business initiative is given adequate bank credit support. It is one of 36 enterprises that were granted such support on exceptionally favourable terms under credit line in the total amount of EUR 33.25 million granted to Serbia by the Italian government in mid-2005. So far, over EUR 13.2 million have been disbursed and 200 new jobs created. We expect that disbursement of the second and the third tranche in the amount of EUR 10 million each will also result in the creation of a notable number of new jobs. The results achieved by this enterprise are yet another proof of our ability to compete in business if the state secures a stable macroeconomic environment, the NBS provides for stable prices and the banking sector grants adequate credit support. Since the beginning of transition in Serbia, the NBS has acted as agent for disbursement of funds under another two credit lines: 1) When in 2001 we began disbursing funds under European Agency for Reconstruction donations for small and medium size enterprises it took us almost two years to disburse RSD 1.2 billion via credits granted through domestic banks. Now we need much less time. Due to regular servicing of debt under these loans, a revolving fund was created and additional RSD 1.1 billion was granted to private enterprises. In late 2005 funds under this credit line became property of the Republic of Serbia and shall be disbursed over the next 10 years under the same terms and conditions (EUR 200,000 loans with five year maturity and one year grace period and annual interest rate down to 8.08%) and for the same purpose – development of small and medium size enterprises. On the overall, so far 303 enterprises were granted RSD 2.3 billion from this credit line, which provided for the creation of 2,486 new jobs. 2) First long term loans to finance domestic small and medium size enterprises and local government infrastructure projects were granted in 2002 from the first Financial Agreement on APEX Global Loan in the amount of RSD 1.6 billion granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB). All of the funds under this agreement were disbursed through a selection of domestic banks by 25 enterprises and one municipality over the period of two years only and another 550 new jobs were created. The loans granted to small and medium size enterprises had the maturity of up to 12 years and a 3 year grace period and those granted for the development of the infrastructure projects had the maturity of 15 years and a five year grace period. Fixed interest rate is 7.8% and the variable rate 6.93%. Signing of the second APEX Global Loan provided for additional RSD 3.6 billion of which 28 loans have so far been granted in the amount of over RSD 1.1 billion and 287 new jobs have been created. In the meantime, EIB has expressed its willingness to provide additional credit lines to small and medium size enterprises directly, via commercial banks, without the backing of the government guarantee which is a proof enough of the superfluousness of the state, and it should be so! I am pointing out these facts because the NBS is of the opinion that the development of small and medium size enterprises is not achievable by either political declarations or strong or weak political stance or by “giving a cut” of state funds through budgetary support under any name. That is the task to be performed by commercial banks and all these loans that have been granted under much more favourable terms than those prevailing in the market as regards interest rates and maturity, represent a real trigger for the development of small and medium size enterprises which are normally a driving force behind development of any economy and a means for resolving employment issues. With the aim of encouraging banks to increase lending to small and medium size enterprises, in October, the NBS abolished the obligation of banks to engage their own funds in arranging two credit BIS Review 121/2006 1 
lines – European Investment Bank and the Revolving Fund – which shall make such loans even more attractive to their end users. Bearing this aim in mind and owing to a further decline in inflation and interest rates in Serbia, NBS feels confident that a further decline in interest rates on these loans is soon to follow. One of the major problems which cannot be solved without a strong government backing remains unfinished business with respect to a bulk of property that has not yet been entered into the Land Registry and could otherwise be used as security in arranging mortgage loans. Finding a solution to this problem will not be helpful for small and medium size enterprises only. During our visit today we have found yet another evidence that there are successful entrepreneurs in our country. The good news is that banks are willing to grant loans and the “bad” news is reserved for the Italian government: Stand ready and start arranging yet another credit line! 2 BIS Review 121/2006 
Ardian Fullani: Past and future banking reforms in Albania and the region Speech by Mr Ardian Fullani, Governor of the Bank of Albania, at The Fifth International Banking Forum, Athens, Greece, 6 December 2006. *      *      * Honorable Dr. Margret Doyle, Dear Mr. Chairman,   Distinguished participants, Before starting my speech I would like to briefly address the perennial question that stands at the heart of our quest: “Are the prosperous times ahead of us?” It comes to my assistance an old saying of one of your ancient philosophers, Eupides: “Prosperity is full of friends”. As we are gathered here as friends, I believe we have a positive answer to this question.  I would like to thank “The Economist Conferences” for inviting the Bank of Albania in this very important forum. It is a great pleasure to be here today. The topic of my speech will be economic reforms. I will take this opportunity to express my views on past and future banking and financial reforms in Albania and the region. The topic is not new of course. However, reforms and their implementation are a dynamic process that must reflect changes and expectations for future developments in both domestic and global markets. Therefore, it will always be an open discussion in need for new ideas and solutions. Central banks are important contributors to the economic reforms and their implementation. They not only welcome and support but also generate reforms in the capital, labor, and product markets. Such reforms have ripple effects that go beyond economic benefit of a long run stable growth and financial stability. I believe that positive spillovers will be materialized in the South East European region’s prosperity and its economic and political integration in European Union. The Bank of Albania has been a constant generator and supporter of reforms both institutionally and as the provider of stable prices, sound macroeconomic conditions and financial stability. It makes an undeniable fact that financial integration which we are experiencing will be to the forefront of European Union integration process. It will ease the challenges and speed up the process of European integration which Albanians have embraced by wide popular consent. Like in many other transition economies banking reforms in Albania were implemented as an integral part of the structural reforms undertaken to transform the Albanian economy in a market oriented economy. Continuous improvement, along with approval and implementation of new banking legislation and supervisory regulation; liquidation and privatization process of the state owned banks; and foreign ownership; have change banking and financial markets.  Foreign banks have been an important push factor toward increasing efficiency, number, quality, and coverage of financial intermediation. New entries, mergers and acquisitions are recently altering the market structure in both asset and liabilities. Reforms that brought big European players and their capital in the market, have further increased confidence in our economy and in the region as whole.  However, the presence of foreign banks does not replace the need for legal and institutional framework. Moreover, latest developments in banking and financial markets might foster additional risk factors related to asymmetric exposure, issues of home host supervision and financial safety net with foreign banks dominance. These challenges and the expected financial developments in the region will outline the scope and the structure of reforms in the future. So, please allow me to briefly present my view on the future trends of regional financial markets.   Financial markets in the region are becoming part of broader global developments which fuels financial integration, liberalization, and financial innovation. The lucrative regional market and the consolidation process have imposed a vertical financial integration in the region. Less than ten European banks with headquarters in Vienna, Athens or Milan dominate the regional banking markets. The process of financial integration will continue, making the region more and more integrated to the European Countries. Financial systems are leading the road to financial integration and the positive spillovers of such process will spread over.  Financial markets are and will continue to be bank dominated. Non banking financial sector will grow very rapidly, but banks will continue to be the major players. They will help to further build the needed BIS Review 121/2006 1 
financial infrastructure for nonbanking financial activities, and support growth in our economies. Not long ago I asked a friend of mine who had recently returned from migration after 15 years: “Why did you come back”? His answer was simple but true: “It is not important for me where I like to live – he said – it is important where the opportunities are”. As the gap in living standards closes and Albanians see opportunities flourishing in Albania, they will come back. They will bring important human capital and managerial skills, which they have gained in the countries where they work. Many Albanian emigrants are at this stage of the migration cycle and we see potential benefits from such a process. It is the role of banks to match this human capital with necessary financial capital and provide financial services to develop their entrepreneur skills.  This role comes very naturally to Greek commercial banks that operate in Albania, which I take the opportunity to thank for their early confidence in Albania. They are natural partners for these new entrepreneurs who are familiar with the culture, and probably have a long history operating with respective Greek offices. The fact that such ventures could also involve Greek capital in the case of pure joint investments makes one more argument in support of my observation. According to the Bank of Albania surveys, Greek companies are ranked first by the size of capital invested in the Albanian economy, while holding the second place for the number of Foreign Direct Investments.  The involvement of these banks in financing such activities will play a positive role in shifting the balance of the loans portfolio from retail and consumer crediting toward production activities in industry and agriculture. At the same time, it might also fuel the growth rate of credit to economy, which has already experienced very rapid growth during the last two years, raising concerns for macroeconomic and financial stability. The results of reforms were not limited only to the openness and development of domestic financial market. They generated price and financial stability, sustained economic growth, assisted institutional building and increased confidence. These developments attracted interest of, and brought big financial groups in the region in general and Albania in particular. As I mentioned above entry of big financial groups, and the consolidation process that has followed since will continue to grow. What we are observing right now in the market is that the big fish is eating the small fish; the very big fish is eating the big fish in the European market with implications for the host countries. However, the process is far from over, gigantic fish (global player) might enter the region by eating the very big fish. Last but not the least, there will be mergers among domestic banks as well.  Despite the increase in the concentration ratio that comes with these mergers and acquisitions, we have started to observe increased competition in our market. This competition increases efficiency, introduces new services and products, lowers spreads and generates positive spillovers for economic activity. While this makes a good precondition to foster financial stability, it is not a sufficient condition to increase financial discipline.  Currently, the activities of financial institutions and commercial banks have a limited scope; however, we are starting to see the signs of financial conglomeration. We have no doubt that this trend will grow and continue in the future. It will bring innovation, new financial instruments and products in the market. Along with this, rapid growth of credit and debit cards as well as other systems of payments will continue to grow. While these instruments might not subside or even reduce the use of cash, this trend must be taken into account.  Transition economies of the region are lucrative markets. They are growing substantially faster than traditional European markets and offer impressive prospects for high profits and significant growth. To give you an example, return on banking activity in Albania during the last two years has been around 20 percent. These positive prospects and the eagerness to compete quickly and beyond rational limits for profits and market share may create potential risks. If managers were to lose sight of the entire picture, and financial constrains, such competition might result in mismanagement, nonperforming loans, and other banking problems. Therefore, there is no room for sloppy managerial attitude. It is very important that managerial staff must be up to the challenges which, if materialized, could be more complex than in the self-regulated developed markets. It is important to act enbloc and engage in regional projects of infrastructure including here the financial ones.  We have great confidence in the ability of the banking system to promote the best banking and cautionary practices; however, I believe that preemptive action is needed to ensure that latest observed trends do not hamper financial stability. Therefore, we cannot neglect improving our legislative, regulatory and prudential measures as a major element of financial sector reforms in Albania.  2 BIS Review 121/2006 
In this regard, a new Draft Banking Law is prepared by Bank of Albania; likewise, a new Law on Securities will be introduced shortly. In addition, efforts are underway to revise legislation on Pension and Investment Funds, and draft a Law on the Payments Systems, which will substitute several sub-legal acts issued by the Bank of Albania until now. This process aims at gradual harmonization of the banking legislation with that of the Acquis Communnautaire.  To address issues of increased competition, poor managerial practices and safeguard stability, the Bank of Albania is working toward establishing a Credit Registry, revising regulatory framework on capital adequacy ratio and credit risk management, increasing on-site supervision, and improving its stress-testing models. Following Financial Stability and Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations, a separate entity “The Authority of Financial Supervision”, has been established recently to supervise the securities, insurance and pension funds markets.  Last but not the least, I would like to address the implementation of the Basel II accord. While it will shape the financial market, I believe it will pose challenges to our banking system and to us at the moment. We have initiated the implementation of the new accord, but we are currently being pragmatic to approve only the adoption of well understood elements of Basel II that can be implemented in a safe way.  Now, I would like to shift your attention to the other important pillar of banking reforms: the role of the central bank itself and its monetary policy. The contribution of the Bank of Albania to the economic reforms comes also through maintaining stable prices and helping to ensure financial stability. Over the last five years the Bank of Albania stability oriented monetary policy has generated low and stable inflation; it has also ensured that medium and long run inflation expectations have been well contained. The economic growth has been robust at around 5-6 percent of GDP, while enjoying a high degree of financial stability. Reflecting broadly on the nature of the monetary policy I would say that it has always been focused on maintaining price stability and using the control of monetary aggregates as an intermediate target. Current account and foreign exchange transactions were liberalized at the early stages of transition along with the adoption of the free floating exchange rate regime.   Indirect instruments are been used to transmit interest rate and liquidity signals to the market. Repo rate has become the signaling tool for short term interest rates while repo and reverse-repo operations are used to manage liquidity. Reforms in the conduct of the monetary policy have granted greater flexibility to banks to determine both the volume and terms of lending and deposits.  The Bank of Albania has provided all necessary conditions to ensure sustainable economic growth and stable prices; however it alone can not guarantee that the objectives will be fulfilled. All these positive developments have taken place in the presence of a well contained fiscal expansion, as element of sound fiscal policy and bold structural reforms.  Banking system has become an important provider of domestic financing for the government. Commercial banks have played a major role in it, while direct financing from the Bank of Albania was limited to address issues of independence and deficit monetization. Recently Government introduced to market papers of five years maturity. In addition, with the consent of the IMF, government will shortly issue euro denominated government securities. Bank of Albania welcomes such development as a certification of cautious and responsible fiscal policy. At the same time we call for more prudence and proper addressing additional risks.  It is undeniable however, that these latest developments have been achieved under the watchful eye of International Monetary Fund. IMF has been an important element of the reforms in Albania. Its presence and the memorandum of understanding signed under the framework of ESAF and current blend of PRGF and EEF Programs, enhanced credibility of our economic reforms and served as external anchors. However, as our economy grows and current agreement ends at 2009, we will soon get full ownership of our economic policies with a reduced role of IMF under article 4 of the Agreement.  The Bank of Albania has a proven track record of competence, credibility and professionalism in the service of our economy. These three elements provide necessary conditions to support and guarantee achievement of economic goal of stable prices and boost credibility in Albanian economy; but, we can not be hold responsible for the behavior of the other players. I am convinced that we need to find and implement clear domestic and foreign anchors to preserve the credibility of our reforms in the future. For the way ahead we are focusing our efforts in the identification and utilization of key elements of the state, politics, markets, institutions and general public that could efficiently play the role of domestic anchors. As part of this preemptive action, the Bank of Albania is carefully considering the possibility BIS Review 121/2006 3 
to launch a fully fledged inflation targeting regime of monetary policy in the midterm. This will be a conditional decision based upon results of current ongoing research, evaluation of the preconditions and building up of capacities. Other possible anchors such as a memorandum of understanding with ministry of finance and public education are considered as well.  On the foreign side we see numerous prestigious partners which understand our concerns and appreciate the value of fiscal discipline. They enjoy the power and the virtues of an influential voice. Some of them have already been partners in reforms and will be shaping the future ones. European integration process and the Association and Stabilization Agreement that we just signed in provides nominal anchors. In addition, sovereign ratings and other independent country reports could also play this role. The Bank of Albania intends to establish open lines of communication and adopts instruments that will automatically start building up pressures before it is too late.  My personal conviction is that European Accession lies out as a natural process, where central banks have a vital role to play. This approach would be of mutual benefit and it will speed up the convergence toward European standards, making the political decision a natural outcome of our efforts. To make this process more effective the central banks and the European institutions should continue the dialogue, why not even by surveillance, supporting, assisting and guiding us in fundamentals and economic financial and legal, infrastructure. This process would increase our responsibility and accountability to make Albania an eligible partner. Let me conclude my discussion quoting Euripides who says: “Much effort, much prosperity”.  Thank you again. 4 BIS Review 121/2006 
Jean-Pierre Roth: Implications for business of the new international monetary order Address by Mr Jean-Pierre Roth, Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank for International Settlements, at the Annual Conference of the International Business Academy, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, 8 December 2006. This address has been prepared with the help of Mrs Maria Rueda Maurer, International Research and Technical Assistance Unit, Swiss National Bank. *      *      * It is a pleasure for me to be here discussing one of the most important issues of our times: financial globalisation and its implications for international business. Globalisation, the landmark of the dawn of the 21st century, has opened up new opportunities for growth and prosperity on the planet. It has created fantastic investment perspectives to those firms that can compete internationally. But it has also changed the rules of the game and brought about new challenges. Today, the success and the survival of international business are determined more than ever at the private level. Because goods and capital are free to move across national borders, protection from risks emanating from globalisation can be a matter for private strategy only, rather than public policy. This, I think, is the main difference between the globalised world of today and the partitioned world of separated nations in the past. Let me share with you my views on how the globalisation of financial markets and the concomitant emergence of a new monetary order have changed the playing field for international business, and on what roles you, the private sector, and we, the central banks, are now called to play. What is the new international monetary order? The globalisation of finance has led to important changes in the ways monetary authorities implement their policies. Over the last decades we have witnessed the reorganisation of the world monetary order, with choices polarised around two extremes: at one extreme the flexible exchange rate regimes such as the ones in the USA, the UK and in Switzerland, and at the other extreme very fixed regimes, such as the monetary union chosen by the countries belonging to the euro area. Pegs still exist, especially in Asia, but they are less numerous than in the past. Let me talk first about how different national monetary choices meet the challenges of financial globalisation. We have left behind us a time where international monetary relationships, based on the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, gave us a nice feeling of order and security. The keepers of that order were central banks, and their main job was to maintain the exchange rates for their currencies within a narrow band. International businesses, for their part, were free to plan ahead, unaware of nasty surprises emanating from sudden currency exchange disorders. And yet this world of apparent security collapsed. By the late 1960s, fundamental misalignments between the major economies had become too great to support an international fixed exchange rate system and, reluctantly, we had to accept that the security we had taken for granted had become an unsustainable fiction: with ever growing international capital mobility, pegged regimes had become increasingly difficult to maintain. The reason is easy to understand: with capital free to move across national borders, the price of any currency is determined like the price of any other internationally traded asset – through the interaction and expectations of actors that operate beyond the borders of the issuing country and in response to variables that are beyond the area of influence of national authorities. By the early 1970s, central banks could not ignore this basic truth, and by 1976 all major currencies were floating. The Bretton Woods system was dead. In the decades that followed, many countries, especially developing ones, tried to cling to a dollar peg with periodic adjustments, in an effort to bring stability to their currencies. They were operating what economists call intermediate exchange rate regimes. The series of costly crises of the 1980s and 1990s proved how dangerous this path could be. The adjustable pegs that were able to channel thin capital flows were completely ineffectual when it came to containing the huge capital flows BIS Review 120/2006 1 
encountered in a more globalised world. By 1996, flexible exchange rates predominated in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, non-industrial Europe and the Western Hemisphere.1Today, many advanced countries and emerging economies have adopted a flexible exchange rate regime.2 By this I understand a regime in which the exchange rate is basically left to fluctuate in response to market pressures. True, the central bank can, and in some circumstances will intervene to mitigate extreme exchange rate fluctuations. But the main objective of the central bank is domestic price stability, not exchange rate stabilisation. This is the system that Switzerland has chosen to pursue. It has served us well. Exchange rate flexibility allows national budgetary and monetary polices to diverge from one country to another. It confers monetary authorities more room to adapt policies to domestic economic realities. A different strategy has been followed by many European countries. Abandoning their domestic currencies, these countries have fully insulated themselves from intra-zone exchange rate fluctuations by adopting the hardest possible peg, which is a monetary union. Monetary policy is the responsibility of a supranational institution, the ECB. Towards the rest of the world, the euro is allowed to float, and the necessary adjustment of prices in member countries, rather than taking place via movements in the exchange rates, is expected to occur by means of changes in wages and product prices in an increasingly integrated economic area. Thus the Bretton Woods system has been replaced by an order of sorts, in which there are two extreme choices which increasingly dominate national strategies. At the one extreme, countries have opted to let their currencies float and be determined by market forces. At the other, some countries have opted for full insulation from exchange rate fluctuations by renouncing monetary independence. Consequences of the new international monetary order What are the consequences of this new international monetary order? The first positive consequence is undoubtedly the increased stability of the international monetary system. Indeed, one of the paradoxes of our times is that the apparent disorder of today is far more stable than the apparently ordered system of the past. In the presence of high capital mobility, the two most resilient exchange rate regimes are those that today dominate the planet: very flexible regimes and very hard pegs. The move away from intermediate regimes has reduced the probability of costly financial crisis. Thus the priority given by central banks to price stability and the abandonment of the exchange rate anchor has resulted in more – rather than less – foreign exchange stability. Evidence of this are recent potentially destabilising events, like the recent war in Lebanon, which have passed without major international financial turmoil. This brings me to the new division of labour between private and public agents that I mentioned in the introduction. The increased stability is based on a new contract between society and monetary authorities: Those countries that, like Switzerland, have chosen the flexible exchange rate regime, base the success of their monetary policy on the credibility and transparency of their central banks. We are no longer – thankfully – attempting to construct a kind of Maginot line to contain international capital flows. This effort would be as costly and as ineffectual as the Maginot line itself was. Instead we, the central banks, are endeavouring to provide markets with timely, clear and reliable information on our views about the future path of inflation and the effect this may have on our interest rate policy. You, the private sector, analyse this information and act upon it. Unlike the situation in the past, when international businesses were led to believe that the future path of exchange rates was predictable, today we have a more realistic situation in which the business community knows that shocks can occur, and that what is predictable is the way in which the central bank will react to them. In addition to a more stable international monetary order, this new paradigm has brought us many other advantages: Lower inflation, lower real interest rates and lower international spreads are additional achievements. After decades of high inflation and even recurrent episodes of hyperinflation in various emerging markets, the last ten years have been marked by low stable inflation in most                                                       1  Caramazza, F. and J.

countries of the world. Price stability has benefited all. Consumers benefit, of course, because their income is no longer eroded by price growth. But producers have also gained because price stability helps them to plan ahead. Lower inflation and confidence in central bank policies have, in turn, reduced uncertainty about future price developments. The lower inflation risk premium is allowing even industrial economies to grow at lower real interest rates than in the past. And, finally, an unambiguously beneficial consequence of the new international monetary order is that it allows for more efficient distribution of capital. At the same time as the current polarisation of exchange rate regimes has come into being, financial globalisation has intensified. Capital controls are being lifted in a growing number of developing countries. In the 1970s, net flows of private capital to the world's poor countries amounted to a little over 1% of host-country GDP.3 By the end of the 1990s, this percentage figure had grown by a factor of three. Today, there is a broader acceptance of the benefits to be derived from financial liberalisation. Indeed, the gains expected from a free market for international capital are substantial. Global finance allows for a better allocation of world resources, enhancing the prospects for growth of all nations. For richer countries of the world, there are new investment opportunities to finance the expanding needs of their aging populations. Younger and poorer nations obtain access to capital to realise their high potential growth. This is the basic teaching of the theory of international capital flows. Financial integration, together with technological advances in financial markets and financial market instruments, is benefiting the world at large by allowing capital to be invested where returns are higher. Where are the risks? But these benefits also entail new risks. Indeed, despite better institutions, better policies and better markets, we feel more vulnerable nowadays than we used to in the past. How can we reconcile this image of a more prosperous and safer world with our increased feeling of danger? To some extent, our sense of vulnerability simply reflects advances in telecommunications that have enhanced our awareness of the world. I am not a geologist and therefore I cannot tell you whether we are now experiencing more earthquakes than we did 30 or 40 years ago. However, I do know that nowadays I am informed within hours, if not minutes, of any earthquake, flood or terrorist attack that occurs, even in the remotest corner of the planet. Our sense of security is bound to be affected by this kind of information. But it is not just a matter of perceptions. Globalisation means that we in Switzerland are indeed affected by events occurring in India, Brazil, Australia, Japan, Argentina… To a certain extent, our perception of heightened vulnerability is justified. SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or "bird flu" have the potential to become pandemics of unprecedented reach because we travel more than in the past. A terrorist attack in any city around the globe will be felt immediately by investors worldwide. Global companies may see their chains of supply disrupted by strikes in far away lands. We have no control over these events and no possible way to guess where the next catastrophe – natural or manmade – will occur. Let me return to global finance. I have said before that the world today is less likely to witness the recurrent crises that afflicted so many countries in the 1980s and 1990s. I am convinced that this is the case. By choosing a flexible exchange regime, they have chosen a more resilient system, and many of them are pursuing sensible macroeconomic policies that should help them navigate turbulent waters more safely than in the past. But I am also convinced that not all countries are equally well prepared to cope with free capital mobility. For those countries with weak institutions and underdeveloped financial sectors, globalisation means more rather than less vulnerability. International financial integration may look like a blessing when foreign capital flows in, but it will look like a curse when foreign investors head for the door. The present monetary order is more resilient than the previous regime of fixed exchange rates, but crises can still occur, and if they occur they are more likely to be extensive and spread rapidly. And globalisation, of course, goes far beyond financial integration. Global companies are located all over the world. They have to deal with different legal frameworks, with different business cycles, with different political realities. The range of risks to be met by international business is thus far broader                                                       3 The Economist, Global Finance Survey May 2003.

than in the past and demands permanent monitoring and continuous improvement of risk management at all levels. Financial, operational and reputational risks are all new by-products of globalisation, and we are only just beginning to come to terms with them. A survey of corporate directors quoted by the Economist in 2004 showed that a clear identification of risks is still too difficult for many well trained CEOs: 36% of the corporate directors polled actually admitted that they did not fully understand the risks faced by their company. Implications for the private sector With globalisation, your lives have undoubtedly become more difficult. Operating at a global level is infinitely more complex than the regional approach of the past. Globalisation is a challenge for business management. It entails many sources of uncertainties but also offers many vehicles to cope with risk. Can we beat these new risks? No. We must prepare ourselves to face them. We can only insure against some risks, but we cannot predict where the next blow will come from. I think that this is the most important characteristic of our times. What has increased is not our insecurity. We are, in many respects, safer than in the past. This, I hope, is what I have managed to convey to you. My conviction is that the world today is better managed than in the past and, in that sense, is safer. What has increased, however, is the magnitude of a potential crisis. This is what I refer to as uncertainty. The big challenge for international business of today is to learn to live with uncertainty. And in this domain we still have a way to go. Nowadays, our difficulties in dealing with uncertainty permeate all our discussions about the responsibilities of different private and government agents. I perceive an understandable – but in my opinion misconceived – nostalgia for a world that used to appear safer, thanks to regulation. We hear demands for the construction of barriers to protect ourselves from the menacing world outside – demands for more regulations to ensure that financial providers cannot go bust, cannot cheat, cannot make wrong decisions; more trade barriers to ensure the survival of domestic producers; more restrictions to the movement of persons to protect our workers… The problem with this dreamworld cocoon is that it has never worked and will not work. And what is even worse, if it did work, if it were possible to barricade ourselves against all possible menaces, we would still not be better off. Globalisation is a great opportunity and it can make us all richer and safer. But we have to learn to live with risk. In fact, the main danger I see today is that because we live in a more stable world, in a safer world, we may become complacent. And here I must say that I do not feel comfortable with the recent developments in financial markets. The surge in asset prices in many countries, the absence of volatility in many markets and the low level of credit spreads show that today's investors have an unprecedented confidence in the future and a strong appetite for all types of risks. For sure, economic fundamentals have improved in industrialised and in emerging countries. It is, however, hard to believe that the world economy has now entered a phase of lasting and accelerating prosperity. We must remain alert. No major financial crisis has shaken the world in recent years in spite of the Iraq war, rising oil prices, major natural disasters, various terrorist attacks and permanent rumours of new terrorist attacks. The resilience that financial sectors have shown may cause us to forget that crises are still a possibility. Thus, the major challenge for international business today is, to my mind, to keep a weather eye open even when the waters appear calm. 4 BIS Review 120/2006 
Erkki Liikanen: The changing financial environment in Latin America and global imbalances Remarks by Mr Erkki Liikanen, Governor of the Bank of Finland, at the III High-Level Seminar of the Eurosystem and Latin American Central Banks, Madrid, 4 December 2006. *      *      * Latin American countries have successfully reduced their traditional sources of vulnerability in recent years. However, despite the stronger fundamentals, a possible disorderly adjustment of global imbalances would pose serious risks to the region. Against this background, some of the key questions are:  1) how well are the countries in the region prepared for possible future crises,  2) what can the authorities do to make the economies better withstand adverse economic conditions, and  3) what role can Latin America play in the adjustment of global imbalances?  To address these questions, I will focus my comments on three sets of issues. First, I will discuss briefly developments that have led to a significant reduction in external vulnerability in Latin American countries. Here I want to highlight the role that the strengthening of institutional frameworks has had in reducing economic vulnerability. Second, I will try to sketch out a possible disruptive adjustment scenario in order to examine what types of policies are needed to prepare the economies for more turbulent economic conditions. Finally, I will talk a bit about Latin America's role in the adjustment of global imbalances by highlighting some key differences between the region and those emerging market economies that are the main contributors to global imbalances.  1.  Reducing vulnerabilities: importance of institutional frameworks  The background research paper prepared by the ECB staff (“Financial vulnerabilities in Latin American economies: a reappraisal") gives an excellent overview of the evolution of financial vulnerability in Latin American countries. The trend of narrowing spreads has been decomposed into three factors: reduced risk aversion, ample global liquidity and improved country specific factors. The paper also analyses the role that different country specific factors have played in this development. Such analysis is highly valuable for assessing the nature of risks ahead and appropriate policy responses to mitigate them.  The increased appetite for risk has been the main driver behind the narrowing of spreads in all EMEs, yet the effect has been particularly pronounced in Latin America. However, for most countries in the region, sensitivity to the global risk aversion has diminished in recent years. Similarly, the region seems to have become less sensitive to changes in the global liquidity conditions as approximated by the shape of the US yield curve.  The increased importance of country specific factors implies a greater degree of policy independence going forward. For a central banker it is comforting that research shows that monetary policy regime has a direct and significant impact on sovereign bond spreads and that legal independence of central banks has a significant impact on reducing external vulnerability.  These results fit well with other observed developments. It is clear that the exceptionally benign global environment has been a major factor. However, it is equally clear that many Latin American countries have reduced their traditional sources of vulnerability (i.e., a heavy reliance on external sources of finance, weak fiscal regimes and a volatile macroeconomic environment) through impressive improvements in economic policies and supporting institutional arrangements. Despite significant differences between countries, some general trends are clearly distinguishable:  • The quality of fiscal policies has improved considerably as many countries have used the favourable conditions for fiscal consolidation and have made fiscal policies more transparent.  • Monetary and exchange rate policy frameworks have become more sophisticated and the credibility of the policies has improved as inflation rates have declined. Flexible exchange BIS Review 120/2006 1 
rate arrangements and inflation targeting have been underpinned by continued trend in strengthening the institutional independence of central banks.  • There has also been considerable progress in developing financial markets. Many countries have been able to satisfy an increasing share of their financing needs from domestic sources, partly because foreign investors have become more active in the domestic debt markets. Moreover, a few countries have successfully placed local currency issues in the international markets. In general, the dividing line between domestic and international capital markets has become less clear and the "original sin" has become less of a constraint.  • There has been significant progress in debt management practices. Many countries in the region, for example Brazil, have taken advantage of the changed environment and have systematically made their debt stock less vulnerable to exchange rate and interest rate movements (e.g. through changing the denomination and by issuing longer term fixed-rate debt).  Favourable market developments have contributed to strengthening of external positions. Helped by higher commodity prices and generally buoyant demand for exports, current accounts have swung into surplus in many countries in the region. Appreciation of domestic currencies vis-à-vis the US dollar has further supported reduction in external indebtedness.  However, despite these advances, some clear vulnerabilities remain. Public debt stocks have not declined significantly when measured as percent of GDP and indexation of debt remains significant in many cases. Consequently, public finances remain vulnerable to adverse economic shocks. A more recent concern in some countries is the build up of a potentially excessive exposure of the domestic financial system to domestic (non-indexed) government debt.   Before turning to discuss the policy implications of these remaining vulnerabilities, I would like to emphasize that advances in institutional development can never be taken for granted. Indeed, as we have seen in the past, populist policies can easily cause setbacks in this area. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain the political support to institutional reform that fosters financial development. In this regard, strong property rights and a legal system that enforces contracts quickly and fairly are of particular importance. As many of you may recall, we discussed the topic of globalization and financial stability last summer here in Banco de España and safeguarding these two factors were deemed as essential to avoiding pitfalls in financial liberalization.  2.  Possible "anatomy" of the next crisis and the policies to increase resilience to shocks  The region weathered relatively well the May-June 2006 financial market correction, but this episode showed that it has not become immune to shocks emanating from the global financial system. While the "threshold of pain" has clearly improved, the resiliency of the system in the face of a more pronounced external shock remains untested. Against this background, there is no room for complacency. So, what might a more serious external shock look like and how can the authorities prepare the economies for such an eventuality? The region seems particularly vulnerable to the combination of a possible recession in the US and falling commodity prices. Let me elaborate on this a bit to examine the anatomy of a worst case scenario.  I want to emphasize that I am by no means implying that this type of outcome is likely and that there would inevitably be important differences between the countries in the region. Nevertheless, and at the risk of overgeneralising and oversimplifying, I think that it is useful to examine how a vicious circle might unfold in order to draw some policy conclusions.  • A recession in the US (triggered e.g. by wider decline in housing and other asset prices) would hit harder those Latin American countries that have the strongest trade links with the US, such as Mexico, Venezuela and Ecuador. A weaker US demand could well lead to a significant slowdown in China. Direct impact on the region might be relatively limited as the direct trade links between China and Latin America are relatively weak, despite some increases in recent years. However, indirect effects via lower global commodity prices could become quite pronounced.  • Increases in the US interest rates and investors' reduced appetite for risk could lead to significant widening of the emerging market spreads. Liquidity in some markets could dry up causing spreads to widen further as investors would try to reduce their exposures. And 2 BIS Review 120/2006 
currencies in the region could come under pressure to weaken as investors would try to exit certain markets.  • Contagion, which has been vanishing in recent years, could reappear as spreads would widen and investors try to beat others in their attempt to adjust their portfolios. Related to this, the original sin could also return as countries would have increasing borrowing needs in the face of a deteriorating economic outlook and weaker fiscal balances.  • One big question mark would be the role that credit derivatives might play in the propagation of the crisis. At the moment there is much uncertainty about the way credit risks have been distributed in the financial system and the issue who is their ultimate holder. Possible problems in the credit derivatives market could spell further trouble for emerging market borrowers. These issues are analyzed in great detail in the forthcoming issue of the ECB's Financial Stability Review that will be published any day now.  • Declines in stock prices and increases in bond yields could weaken domestic balance sheets. These factors, and a generally weaker economy, could put a strain on domestic financial institutions.  • Fiscal balances could be hit through many channels: weaker economy, higher debt service as a result of higher interest rates and possibly also weaker currencies. Possible problems in the domestic financial systems could also force governments to incur additional liabilities.  Countries with sound fiscal positions and well-anchored inflation expectations might have some scope for countercyclical policies. Such countries could also benefit from flexible exchange rates. However, in cases where the fiscal position is not sound enough, and if currency mismatches of debt would erode the potential benefits of exchange rate flexibility, there would be very little that the authorities could do after the onset of the vicious circle.  This analysis underscores the urgency to tackle the remaining vulnerabilities before a crisis. Specifically:  1) fiscal vulnerability needs to be reduced through more ambitious fiscal consolidation and further improvement in debt management practices. And  2) financial sector vulnerability can be reduced through enhanced supervision and by measures that support further development of deeper and more liquid markets. One challenge related to the financial sector is making domestic private sector balance sheets more resilient to potential interest rate shocks.  Unless these vulnerabilities are tackled decisively, monetary authorities could be faced with insurmountable tasks if a crisis materializes. Indeed, as a result of a possible severe crisis, there could be a backslash against central bank independence and other advances that have been made in institutional development in recent past.  3.  Global imbalances: Latin American countries vs. East Asian EMEs and oil exporters  Latin America's role in the resolution of global imbalances is generally perceived to be minor relative to that of the East Asian economies and oil exporters. A number of factors help explain this difference. The most obvious difference is that many of the East Asian EMEs only relatively recently joined the global economy and are now experiencing a catch up phase characterized by particularly rapid growth (and oil exporters are benefiting from the high oil prices). Latin America's integration into the global economy has taken place more gradually over an extended period of time (and many times this process has been interrupted by economic crises.)  The East Asian economies' truly impressive growth masks underlying weaknesses, or at least it reflects the lack of development in certain areas, that have a bearing on global imbalances. To highlight such factors, it is instructive to compare and contrast Latin American countries with East Asian economies and other countries that are major generators of global imbalances.  East Asian economies and oil exporting EMEs are characterised by large current account surpluses, capital exports to the US (reflected in accumulation of reserves) thus contributing to the long-term interest rates in the US and also globally. Whereas Latin American countries are characterised by lack of major external imbalances. Setting aside the already mentioned differences in the growth rates and phase of the catch up process, what are the main factors that underlie these differences:  BIS Review 120/2006 3 
1) Level of financial market development. Many East Asian economies and oil exporters suffer from chronic shortage of high quality domestic investment assets relative to domestic demand. Moreover, their domestic financial systems have generally weak intermediation capacity. This phenomenon is contributing to lower interest rates in the US, thus fuelling further demand there and contributing to further build up of surpluses in the countries that satisfy this demand through their exports. As you know, e.g. Ricardo Caballero has written several interesting papers on this phenomenon of asset shortages and its role in global imbalances. Many Latin American countries have experienced rapid development of their domestic debt markets. Also, compared with the biggest surplus countries, their financial systems do a better job in financial intermediation.  2) These two groups of countries have also very different savings and consumption patterns. This reflects partly the already mentioned differences in financial systems but there are also other important differences. Many "surplus countries" have poorly developed social safety nets compared with the bulk of Latin American countries. The lack of safety nets forces people to save more and much of these savings are channelled abroad, given the lack of suitable instruments at home. In many of the surplus countries, most notably China, the markets for consumer goods are still underdeveloped, albeit they are developing quite rapidly.  3) There are also striking differences in monetary and exchange rate regimes. In the countries that are the main "culprits" for surpluses, the regimes tend to be based on external anchors and it seems that many of these countries have currently undervalued currencies pegged to the US dollar. In Latin America, the increased prevalence of flexible exchange rate regimes, often combined with inflation targeting, make significant exchange rate misalignment less likely. Furthermore, in these regimes policy stance is determined by domestic conditions not by an external anchor.  Deficiencies in institutional development in many of the surplus generating countries do not always receive sufficient attention in the discussion on global imbalances, which tend to focus excessively on the need for exchange rate adjustment. As for the Latin American countries, one could say that in many important respects these countries have already contributed to resolving global imbalances by implementing sound policies and building institutional infrastructures. In this regard, many of the surplus countries have a lot to learn from the experience of the Latin American countries.  4 BIS Review 120/2006
